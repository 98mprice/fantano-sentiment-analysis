[{"id":"gPdD04_9A9A","title":"Rich Brian - Amen ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone here theny here tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new rich Bryan album amen la v√≠a jakarta rapper rich Brian this is debut album for the 88 rising Records label which is actually a pretty great label that has been making a lot of waves over the past few years kind of working as a crowbar opening up the hip-hop industry to a lot of artists from the far east brian is easily one of the most popular artists on the label kind of one of their flagship artists and you can kind of put his meteoric rise to fame on the shoulders of one of his earliest singles debts tick a track he dropped two years ago a song that was released before he had even turned 18 and looking back on it it's not hard to see why the track has seen and continues to see such viral success brian's deep husky voice his cold-blooded flow the very heavy and hypnotic production he had some slick lines in there too and also a very unique scent sense of fashion which was observed in the video now ever since Brian saw success with this track it's pretty much just been like a marathon of singles some of which have featured the likes of 21 Savage and Joe G Chris whoo xxx 10 Tasi own and Keith Ape and toward the build-up of this album I was pretty excited for it definitely one of my most anticipated records of the year because I felt Brian was bringing a much-needed breath of fresh air into contemporary rap music which increasingly every month seems to get more homogenized with the sounds of trap and triplet flows but unfortunately this album isn't really changing much up this album does have its high points it does but unfortunately I think it also shows Brian having difficulty coming into his own building on the sound we already know him for and kind of stepping out of the shadow of death stick because the best songs and most memorable and most enjoyable songs on this thing kind of have that same vibe I'm talking enemies and occupied and trespass just to name a few all of which feature that have but also kind of minimal production those cold steady flows Brian's deep kind of monotone delivery the song Kitty also stood out to me to as a highlight because it's kind of the album's lone strong narrative a song that sounds like it's about Brian losing his virginity there's a lot of comedic moments throughout the track but for the most part I just kind of find Brian's pen game on this thing just a little underwhelming because there are a lot of moments on here right I don't think he's writing absolute garbage lines or anything but I think what he's saying doesn't come off quite as as slick as he might have liked it to like on the intro track saying that he's a rapper but his name isn't chance also on the song cold I don't take drugs I just take naps find another girl to eat up like I ate snacks also there's a barn here talking about how he doesn't do triplet flows because he's not amigo or on the song occupied when I'm doing business better stay the fuck away make me blow it like a microwave the lines on this thing that stick out for the wrong reasons they're kind of few and far between however I don't think there are enough lines on this thing that stick out for the right reasons too few moments on this record where I'm kind of hit with a bar I'm just like damn he said that he said that just generally a severe lack of quotables on this thing but I will say throughout this record I do appreciate these small and subtle references he peppers through some tracks where he is talking about his life before music his upbringing his family his personality his quirks all these things that make him a special artist and a special figure in the rap game right now as far as his flow and his style go on this thing I don't necessarily mind a rapper who plays this super low-key I've enjoyed records from rock marciano and evidence who has a new album out that you should hear also quali Chris or kah but if that's the direction you're gonna take things in like the lyrics really have to hit or you have to have some kind of eccentric quality to yourself or the instrumentation that really kind of sells the track and makes the very subtle approach that you're pulling people in with worth it because Brian's very deep monotone flow do get kind of tedious after a while because he doesn't change it up that often if at all I mean there are a handful of cuts on here that are smoother more melodic more mellow like be song introvert featuring Joji who provides a nice feature on that track we also have the song Arizona with August Oh 8 which has a kind of awkward beef switch and ending and then there's little prince with Nicki but while all these tracks are pleasant to listen to they're fine are they highlights are they some of the best tracks on the album I don't think so I don't really think these songs do much outside of just provide a little bit of variation along the track listing just to break up some of the harder and darker and more aggressive spots on this thing so that it's not so uniform for the most part this album is listenable but it's very middle-of-the-road it has very little in the way of surprises and if Brian is going to successfully transition from being a singles artist to being an album or a mixtape artist he's gonna have to provide more in the way of ideas and versatility because even though this thing was 44 minutes long which is not really that long of an album I already felt halfway through that I had pretty much heard everything he was going to offer on this thing I will say though the production on this thing is a little bit more dope than average like it's it's just a bit more colourful and quirky than your average low-key track banger and Brian is still showing more character and personality than a lot of his contemporaries in his age range in the rap game right now I definitely know a rich Brian song when I hear one but currently as his sound stands he's dropping a lot of tracks that to me feel kind of under written and kind of one-dimensional I'm feeling a light decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if

here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the self-titled superorganism album superorganism is a london-based music collective with like seven or eight musicians who actually managed to land a hit a viral internet hit before they even met in person that's the future now bands duo's musical projects rap groups everybody's just meeting each other and collabing on the internet what's what it is well even though this phenomenon is relatively new superorganism sound on some of their biggest tracks to me read as being kind of old their music called back to the dense quirky playful instrumentation that used to get tons of attention in the indie scene in the 2000s through artists that kind of sat at a crossroads between pop music and psychedelic music as well as like maybe even electronics and Glitch pop D Intel and the unicorns sweet trip or Fiery Furnaces maybe like anything off of elephant six I could also see fans of Animal Collective and Flaming Lips appreciating what superorganism has to offer maybe I'm going a tad bit too far with the comparisons there but there is something about this band's music that just reads to me as as studied they don't sound like a bunch of kids with no frame of musical or cultural reference just throwing a bunch of at a wall or trying to copy one of their contemporaries so while superorganism sound as kind of a familiar energy to me they do bring more synthetic and punchy or production that I'm used to hearing with this stuff more funky beats insane samples that do so much to color the topics of these songs like motivational speaker Tony Robbins or like vocals from what sounds like a nature documentary water splashing alarm clocks ringing snapping cameras people eating crowds cheering car horns honking just to name a few things I mean the band's music isn't so sample heavy that they're like the books or anything like that but you know it's it's pretty plunder phonic accompanying these samples in the mix are of course all these fat bulgy rumbling synth lines string guitars sweet background vocals trippy effects lots of weird glitchy embellishments and edits there's a lot to this band sound so many of these tracks while they are super catchy super easygoing very poppy are very intricate the most unassuming thing about the band's sound has to be the vocals of their frontwoman or no Noguchi who pretty much sings every track in this semi deadpan very gentle very warm and welcoming vocal delivery it's not too animated it's not too expressive it's not exactly ear grabbing but couched in the incredibly dense and colorful and and vibrant sound of superorganisms instrumentation it works and even though or no isn't a very animated singer she does manage to express a very potent sense of Millenial malaise I'll say that pretty consistently these songs are just an explosion of texture and color which is great I love that about the album but at the end of the day it is the very dreamy endearing Tunes that kind of sells this record the song everybody wants to be famous the sliding guitars and really trippy effects and samples and edits the ear worm hook I could go into all of this stuff all day but really what I like about the track is that it's it's an interesting little statement on vanity and desire for fame in the social media age call it an anthem for internet stardom if you want I also love the very blissful nobody cares which to me almost seems like the antithesis of the track that I just mentioned where it seems almost like a moment of serenity and freedom where you can kind of do whatever you want because nobody's bothering you nobody cares I don't know if maybe this is kind of like a coming-of-age song or an adulthood song but the previous track that I mentioned is all about having people's eyes on you whereas this track is is very much about nobody really being concerned about much of anything you also the crunchy skipping beat the vocal harmonies the laser synthesizers and the twisted manipulated guitar lines bring this track a lot of instrumental color the equally sticky and surreal something for your mind is just pure surreal ear candy it's all good while not may be the best song on the record is a good tone setter on the album for me with all of the songs welcoming and very funny samples the boo me beat and very cheery background vocals and the title track on this album is is kind of like a I don't know like a mission statement for the band this track is pretty much superorganism sound to a tee it's just like lots of funky beats and crazy sonic fireworks flying by in every direction and even though it's very hectic there's a lot of cacophony there are a lot of weird intricate little additions to the song everywhere all over the track it's it's still very catchy and given the tone set by the lyrics kind of silly and tongue-in-cheek too even the song reflections on a screen has grown on me since I've listened to the album again and again and again sure the best coast ish Beach guitars played throughout the track do kind of put a sink in my stomach but still I think the track is really cute you can throw it onto the ever-growing pile of millennial love songs set in the age of the internet where you have basically a longing and emotion being placed on a stage of glowing screens and empty chat boxes my issue with the record though is that it's kind of short it's just 30 minutes and change and it's kind of front-loaded around the middle half of the album it does start to fall apart a little bit the song nice March has a great sense of place especially with its story with its samples but it's it's maybe the most underwritten song on the entire record the song prawn song is almost bordering on novelty it seems almost like too silly for me to take seriously in any way shape or form I appreciate that it's trying to have fun though maybe people will enjoy it more who relate to a lyric about kissing a prawn and getting a cold sore and the song nighttime while it is kind of a catchy funky fun tuned and the album off production-wise it's one of the blander tracks on the record like the instrumentation it's not quite as adventurous and cutting-edge as it is on nearly every other song here overall I thought this album was pretty good enjoyed it a lot certainly a lot more high points than Lowe in the track listing here I just wish it was a bit more consistent and I wish that there was just more still this thing is one of the more creative pop records I've heard this year and I encourage everyone to give it a shot at least the most popular tracks the big singles from the album I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well

Isla Bonita ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone I love to me you tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Deerhoof record la snap bonito 20 years as a band and I believe this is their 13th full-length album if I'm wrong on that I'm sure in the comments you'll correct me over the years that they have been a band they've undergone numerous lineups some sound changes but it wasn't the 2000s that they kind of evolved into this style that they're working with currently which has made them one of the most fun-loving idiosyncratic rock and pop groups in the underground Deerhoof is one of those groups that sounds unique as a whole because there are so many unique individual parts that go into the finished product so Tomi is very light hi childlike vocals as well as her kind of esoteric and absurd lyrics Greg's very aggressive frantic groovy and danceable drumbeats and John and Ed's very sharp angular and sometimes very dissonant guitar leads the band is also well known for using some pretty strange chord progressions on their tracks - or time signatures and even though Deerhoof has settled into a pretty familiar style at this point they do make sure to throw in a few left hooks or surprises into every release they are constantly creative and in my opinion rarely disappoint if you're new to the band I suggest you try anything from the album apple o to friend opportunity but as far as their more recent stuff goes we have the album offend Maggie which was easily one of their most straightforward distorted and rough albums so far maybe even to a slight fault because so many of the songs on this record in my opinion sound very much the same because of the kind of harsh recording then we have versus evil which by contrast was a very dynamic and lush record at times with some of dear hopes most tender and beautiful songs yet while delivering their their usual collection of very uppity poppy catchy very fun tracks as well and on the record breakup song their previous record they experimented quite a on some tracks with some electronics some samples but on their latest here lie they seem to be getting back to basics not really fooling around with anything else other than the guitars drums and vocals that we know them for much like a fan Maggie this record has kind of a rough sound to it it's a little grimy the sound of the music here really speaks to the cover are you're looking at something kind of black and white grayscale but it's kind of distorted and warped too it's like watching epic Saturday morning cartoons on an old old television that is seriously on the fritz as you consume massive amounts of the most sugary cereals known to man the drums on this record they're loud they're booming they're harsh the bass is very resonant the guitars are very sharp and shrill and have kind of a very metallic tone to them they are sunburnt and so Tony's vocals are very loud they're very close in this loudness in this straightforwardness again this record reminds me of a fen Maggie but I think Deerhoof comes off a little more dynamic on this record writing some softer tracks some prettier tracks too and simultaneously deer hoof in my opinion actually delivers some of their heaviest material as well on this record this isn't the first time deer hoof has work with quirky extremes on a record of theirs and they do it again here pretty well too we have the song big house waltz which has this huge massive bass drone on it that's fit up against this killer drum be some awesome guitar melodies so Tomi brings forward these vocals at one point that sound like she's like a ringleader at a circus there's a really strange guitar passage toward the back end with the track deer hoof they might be writing something catchy but they always find a way to throw a wrench in the works and do something weird and the song exit only has one of the most aggressive heavy and hard-hitting drum beats and guitar riffs to ever land on a deer cuff album ever there's the song mirror monster one of the more gentle tracks on the LP that features all these fluttering guitars there's some very tender vocal melodies and harmonies on this thing I love the way the chord progression of this track ascends and resolves and there's the song black pitch which has this very twinkly pretty guitar intro that sounds a lot like something that would have been more marketable in the indie scene in the 2000s when Deerhoof was doing much weirder stuff as much as I like the harsh moments on this record it's nice to hear some pretty songs as well especially since the more beautiful spots were what attracted me so much to versus evil the one major downside to this track is the kind of abrupt ending and the closer Oh bummer is is another track that is a little softer a little more melodic though this track is maybe the dreariest of any song on the record with a vocal melody that's that's absolutely nightmarish and emotionally painful and Deerhoof make sure to balance tracks like this out with songs that are unbearably fun like the song doom which is loaded with melodies that sound like I'm on a psychedelic island filled with squawking polkadot parrots and dancing coconuts there's some pretty male/female vocals on this track as well and this is one of the few tracks on the record that kind of follows in an unpredictable linear structure there are a few tracks on this record that are kind of average for Deerhoof like paradise girls not amazing or totally new song for them but this track would be nice on a mix for a girl who is smart and plays bass guitar because that's what the song is about a girl who is smart and plays bass guitar and I wish the song God to was longer it's a really great instrumental that I wish just had more length to it and I wish that for a few other tracks on here too as creative and as fun as some of these songs are I kind of feel like Deerhoof came in brought some interesting ideas brought a great recording but sort of dipped out early on some of these tracks to me this is another entertaining album from Dieruff I wouldn't say there's anything incredibly ambitious about it in comparison with other Dieruff releases or that there's really anything that fantastic about the flow of this album either for sure there's a nice variety of songs here but it still kind of just feels like a standard mixed bag of tracks whose only continuous thread is the band style and the kind of Bhoomi shrill production what ends up saving this record and makes it great to listen to is that we have a lot of good songs here very good quirky fun rock songs that are sweet and very enjoyable in there unorthodoxy I'm feeling strong seven on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you look did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yeah Anthony Fantan oh dear huff forever "},{"id":"slBC3h48xgQ","title":"Daym√© Arocena - Cubafon√≠a ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new relatively new sort of new not as new as usually I review things but hey I'm gonna review it anyway dime a arrow Cena's Q befo Nia this is the latest full-length album from Cuban singer-songwriter instrumental arranger Dinah era Cena who has been pretty prolific in the short amount of time she has been releasing albums under her own name back in 2015 she released her nueva era album a record which I received a CD promo for I was very impressed with her vocal chops but found the instrumentation to be a little hollow a little lacking at points despite the clear attempt to do something a little bit more experimental and edgy than your usual Latin jazz release especially with some of the darker moodier chord progressions on this thing and in very strange vocal layering but I ended up just passing the CD off to my wife because she seemed to enjoy it a little bit more than me and she's been digging on her ever since here and there and lo and behold she's telling me now she's turning me on to stuff she's saying hey did you know this artist has been releasing music release some music last year and I was like no I didn't know that is any better than the album that I gave you because I was really hoping that the instrumental game would kind of be up to little bit on whatever she released into the future because the vocals were really good it seemed like she had kind of a unique thing going but it wasn't totally like you know fully realized turns out in 2016 she dropped a much gmer much more improvisational jazz record which I actually found to be more impressive that record being titled one takes but this follow-up project Cuba fony√≥d this is nice so nice I actually regret not talking about it and now I am coming on here to rectify that because this is my youtube channel and and I will do whatever the hell I want to do the instrumentation on this thing is a fantastic combination of funk and rumba and Latin jazz of course you're getting those hot latin horns on this thing that hand percussion those Cuban grooves as well of course every once in a while these are elevated with a shot of very elegant strings or some very well arranged background vocals the on this thing stick pretty closely to a verse chorus verse format they're not super long-winded jazz tunes but there still is an incredible amount of strong playing on this record even though it seems that the songs and just the directness of these Tunes do take priority because there is quite a bit of flashy playing and performances on this thing to keep the song sounding at least a little intricate and intense dense you know and enough for the jazz heads but really the main appeal of this record for me comes down to era Cena's voice which is so powerful has so much character I mean with every record she's released so far it's really been her voice that has been the the selling point of the project but now that we had this flood of louder and more vibrant and more versatile instrumentation on this album over here it really gives her an amazing foundation to work off of and just show off everything that her voice has to offer everything from the very quiet and precious Valentine which is an incredibly lovely ballad in the tracklisting here to all the feverish scatting which she does over these mathematical Latin rhythms on the track la rumba me llamo yo of course going into this thing there were some songs that was kind of lukewarm on but even some of those managed to win me over eventually like the track maybe tomorrow a track that does have a very pretty melody maybe tomorrow but it does have kind of a musical theatre aesthetic to it that does turn me off a little bit the band plays the song pretty straight these string sections on the track just really lifts dymas vocals up to Soaring highs all of which is pretty nice but I still would have preferred something with a bit more instrumental muscle still though it is nice to hear how she sort of vocally dominates a song even of this style and I guess my last point on this front is that the song como is probably the album's only moment where for me it's sort of over steps that that line into making overly elegant overly smooth ballroom jazz music though I do like the splash of R&B influence that I think turns up in the vocal melody of that track but when it comes to low key moments on this thing I think I do enjoy the track in hell so much more or angel I'm sorry I'm terrible at pronouncing things but I do love how minimal and how strip back and just how subtle that track is at moments to the point where it's almost just like creepy but more often not on this thing the heat is on high especially on tracks like be very tight and uniquely grooved mambo nama a good part of the intro and a few other passages here are dominated by this octave Boombah Boombah Boombah again one of the many more thrilling musical moments on this thing the album finishes up very well - it's not gonna be forever has some very fun and joyous group vocals fantastic latin rhythms and horns on there - pretty much everything you would typically expect out of a Latin jazz track but just delivered with this contemporary vibrance so while sure it's not one of the more original tracks in the bunch it's still an incredibly fun listen and the closing track Valentine I already mentioned earlier is one of the cutest and most fun tracks on the entire record doesn't really add anything too much thematically to the album as an ending but it's still a beautiful song and overall I just kind of see this album as a collection of just beautiful Latin jazz tunes with good performances great production and very tasteful and creative references to the worlds of pop and funk and a myriad of other things throughout there may be a few tracks on here that I wished had a bit more bite or I wished had a bit more development like the track todo por amor which I feel like I can't be the only person who felt like the song ended a bit abruptly like given its pacing that it felt like it was going somewhere else like it had a little bit more to it but outside of that I just really loved this record I love diamonds voice I love the production performances on this thing I think it's a great balance of of sounding like it would appeal to a pop audience because the instrumentation is very clear it's very full it's very bright the chorus is on this thing really pop but yet you know there's there's enough instrumental flash and spark there to keep it from feeling like just a mere jazz pop record and it just sucks that I didn't hear it and I didn't cover it earlier because it just probably would have been my favorite jazz release of last year but yeah I guess what happens happens I'm feeling a light too decent 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next - like

review of the new hopalong album bark your head off dog oh that's gross what happened did you kiss too many cucumbers okay cuz you cuz you're vegan how are you doing this that's just what happens when you haven't eaten meat for 10 years earlier in the decade the band became one of the most exciting new artists on Conor Oberst Saddle Creek label and they built a reputation of recording this really tight nimble indie rock that was equal parts catchy and flashy with lots of angular gymnastic guitar work and of course all this was topped with the strained passionate and somewhat raspy vocals of Francis Quinlan the band's front woman now their last full length record was a little one-dimensional but still all around a really enjoyable album despite that one shortcoming it was their best recorded record yet best crop of songs great performances and this new record over here actually overcomes that problem in comparison with painted shut bark your head off is a much more versatile record also more smooth and laid-back in comparison as well normally that sort of thing would would worry me oh the band's kind of losing their buddy they're losing their fire but actually it's it's not really a bad swap because even in a somewhat more toned down State hopalong songwriting still shines and Francis Quinlan's vocals have an opportunity to show just how versatile they really are some of this record sketchiest moments actually come by way of the band toning things down a little bit because they actually end up sounding a little bit like some of those female fronted alternative rock bands from the 90s that I remember hearing when I was a kid I'm getting some vague impressions of jewell actually specifically on the song somewhere a judge with the breathy vocal harmonies in the background I mean this track to a tee sounds like what could have been a radio song 20 years ago but there's something really fresh and modern about it probably with the plucky guitars and with Quinlan's voice being so idiot Inc Radek and I think on this record she's improved as a lyricist as well not just by way of a lot of these songs being much more complex and tangled narrative Li than the tracks that were on the band's previous album but even some of Francis's most simple statements have a lot of impact like on the intro track where she's talking about what what seems like some kind of relationship between her someone else are just two people in general saying that hey we'll both find out but just not together also to go back to the track somewhere a judge the lyrics on the hook of this song are gorgeous talking about a vanilla Sun crawling across the lawn dragging someone around through her phone like just basically on a phone call their voice and that's another thing hopalong song structurally have matured quite a bit since their last album because on this record they're incorporating more builds interesting transitions progressions and even some really detailed storytelling like in the case of how you got your limp which while structurally may be one of the more underwhelming tracks on the record seems like Direction wise musically it doesn't really know where it's going it seems like the story is really kind of guiding the entirety of the track but it's still a pretty compelling tale of what seems like a professor sort of like abusing their position of power something could be wrong just as intriguing lyrically but a little harder to decipher was the song one that suits me another song with an incredibly catchy refrain that suits me but the lyrics seemed to be some kind of commentary on male leadership youth responsibility I also love the chill but bustling drumbeat on the track what the writer meant feels like a break beat but all the instrumentation laid on top of is so beautiful and serene it's such a wonderful knotty and winding song and I really dig the lyrics about what seems like intentions and and meanings with what someone has written changing over time different manipulations and interpretations being laid onto the work there's also a bit of a religious angle to one of the verses on this track to writing more detailed tracks definitely helps out how belongs long game quite a bit too as the song look of love is the longest track on the record one of the band's longest tracks period but it's just constantly changing pretty logically though and hitting the listener with different sounds again and again and again giving us at the start a wonderful acoustic intro very angelic and then transitioning into some nice mid pace kind of driving indie rock then some idyllic string beds then a few passages of swaying rock instrumentation with slinky guitars and organ some of the songs brighter moments get kind of lost and how convoluted the structure is to a degree which is maybe my biggest complaint about this album in general another track I kind of felt that way about was Fox in motion which doesn't have the strongest intro even if the story of the track is pretty good overall this is just a really good follow-up to hop along last record their most versatile record to date a very great blend of indie and pop and funk and alternative rock with good production great performances nice crop of songs and a singer who you could probably call one of a kind there's no major overarching theme on the record they're not reinventing the wheel musically and I guess there's nothing tying all the tracks together that deeply on a conceptual level but hey I'll easily take that over another generic boring pile of crap indie rock record with no freaking personality or someone trying to sound like Mack DeMarco I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this album transition have you given this out and we'll

Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new LCD soundsystem album American Dream this is the latest full-length album from one of my favorite bands of all time LCD Soundsystem New York indie tronic and dance Punk legends who dropped three pretty incredible records from 2005 to 2010 their self-titled sound of silver this is happening their final album there coincided with a huge send-off a farewell tour a movie documenting the band's last days and that last show at Madison Square Garden that they performed LCD Soundsystem and their front man and mastermind - James Murphy gave the band a really grand exit wrapped up in a very bittersweet bow while it was sad and it was sort of aggravating that the band had to end so prematurely leaving it at three great albums is certainly better than continuing to force it and then just drop mediocre material from there on out but then in 2015 the announcement came the LCD soundsystem was in fact getting back together they couldn't even go a full decade broke it up and in the wake of the band reassembling there's been a lot of skepticism aggravation and excitement - and I felt all three but no matter what my feelings on the band reassembling are I mean James Murphy could show up at my place at 3:00 a.m. and say you and if the album ended up being good I mean I'd have to forgive him for it because it's it's the album's good however that's not what I was expecting given the teaser tracks to this album called the police and American Dream the former kicked off like a really a verge new order song and the lyrics to me felt like a really weak attempt to trying to construct some sort of socio-political commentary the messaging of the track just seemed really vague kind of dabbling in like violent revolution like the act of calling the police is some sort of challenge to anybody who would question or stand in the way of James Murphy and whoever he imagines getting together with him to I don't know like destroy the powers that be or eat the rich but my primary issue with the track is that the longer it went on the more I felt like I was just kind of sitting in a bathtub that was growing cold and dirtier because in my opinion the band didn't really bring the progression the clarity the sharpness and the spunk that I enjoyed on their previous releases so much American Dream felt similarly underwhelming to me it is a slow burner of the highest order however in the context of the track listing I do think it's a pretty good ballad I like the Weeping elongated synth leads on the track when I first heard them I liked them even more with repeated listens and in my opinion the track features one of the most compelling vocal performances on the entire record and lyrically the track seems to be about like a revolution that never happened like somebody who thought that they were going against the grain but instead we're just kind of getting wrapped up in haze of drugs and hookups and now in light of kind of missing this wave this protagonist here is just going to kind of give up on fixing the world and being a better person and just kind of become a miserable loser maybe the song American dream hit me harder in the long run than called the police did because the revolutionary fantasy of that track doesn't hit as hard as the sad reality of this one and the song tonight another single a lot like call the police starts off well enough the instrumental is laced with these talkbox vocals these fluttering rhythm guitars a gurgling synth bassline but the groove doesn't really develop into anything exciting to borrow a lyric from the track it feels like forever and the lyrics on the track take a bit of a Chop Suey approach a lot like songs such as pow pow in their back catalogue James Murphy sings about death and artists obsessing about death embarrassing images and factoids about oneself lasting forever online James lyrics make some decent and smart observations yes but I feel like he undermines much of what he's saying with this little aside that he throws into the song randomly James once again reminding us that he's losing his edge here but at this point I don't think he's losing it he's kind of completely lost it he's totally through the process of losing it and it is now gone because he's the snobby judgemental record store employee that society has no use for anymore partially because he cast himself and his band into the used bin before anyone had even really decided whether or not they were done with them and now he's popping back up as if the world wasn't just going to move on and while most people did Indy being the dead end that it was has kind of left an unacknowledged void that nobody is really filling so it's almost like LCD soundsystem with this record is coming back around to provide comfort food for people who can't accept the fact that it's over and I have to stress the the point in the description of this album as comfort food because I don't really feel like anything James and the band have presented here is all that challenging or fierce or progressive James himself seems to admit this on the track change your mind where he goes on to say that he's not as dangerous as it used to be he doesn't really have anything else to say and nowhere on this album is that clearer than on the song how do you sleep which at its beginning sound pretty interesting I mean it has some murky tones some springy echoed spacious percussion sounds like the start of a cool Joy Division track and then the track grows into this sprawling whiny musical exorcism where James Murphy is just like I don't know moaning in this really angsty way about the deterioration of his friendship and business partnership with DFA co-founder tim Goldsworthy obviously Tim played a very big role in James life in the success of the label but I don't know just the way that these emotions play out on this track it's really obnoxious and it's not a good look the tracks airy and very patient build-up is not really that interesting the beat that eventually busts in sounds like a leftover from their last album and this track is not the only moment on this record where I catch like a hint of deja vu a lot of the instrumentals on this thing feel like warmed-over ideas from the band's previous efforts but complemented with these really washed out echoey mixes so that they don't sound like they're kind of perfectly repeating themselves over again which might be one of the worst things about this album because the sound of an LCD Soundsystem song used to be colorful vibrant amazing vivid orally American Dream is just like average I feel almost like they've reverted back to the production quality of their debut record which honestly in terms of just structuring the instrumentation and how the band would kind of pace pieces of instrumentation out as a song grows and progresses was much smarter for example on the song emotional haircut the flat bass the distant drums the reverb II vocals everything in this mix sounds so plain James Murphy's attention to detail and his incredible talent as a producer used to be LCD Soundsystem's greatest asset and now it just doesn't seem to be benefiting them for whatever reason on this album like on the intro track Oh baby which is one of the most tepid beginnings and build ups to any LCD Soundsystem track ever I feel like I'm listening to a version of dance yourself clean that never actually like gets fun and I cannot stand these vapid break-up lyrics Jesus Christ all of the odd beautiful tension that the suicide song that this track is obviously referencing is kind of gone James Murphy essentially replaces it with I don't know just sad desperation and a lack of expectations weirdly enough it's some of the darker and moodier songs in the track listing here that really ended up impressing me like the song I used to it's a very somber track with eerie sense and these shimmering stuttering rhythm guitars the track features one of the most weary and depressing vocal performances on the entire record which for LCD soundsystem is kind of a refreshing change of pace because there is kind of an emotional weight to this track that feels kind of new to the band this feeling this despondency is also kind of repeated on the incredibly sad closer black screen which is a tribute to the friendship that James had running with David Bowie before he passed away there's a lot of regret in the lyrics on this track James essentially singing about how he looked up to him and how he wished he had made more of an effort to connect with Bowie and make the best of their friendship I think the minimal electronic soundscape approach to the track was a good idea however I feel like this song succumbs to a lot of the same subpar musical progressions and mixing that many other tracks on this record do I mean some of the synth leads on this track just sound like they're fumbling as if they're like I don't know somebody in the dark looking for a light switch though I do like the very sad piano passages that kind of take the track out I don't know I mean I'm pretty disappointed by this album to be completely honest I don't know what kind of mental gymnastics James put himself through to psych him out of continuing with LCD soundsystem in 2010 it's like he was scared of making the band's worst album or making music that was no longer in the spirit of what the band originally stood for and despite every attempt at avoiding it that's exactly what the band does here still James and company are able to must a handful of decent tracks they maintain a lot of their musical fundamentals but this record is so obviously off the mark and the only way that I could feel any other way about that is if I just gave in blindly to the hype I know a band is significant and as smart and as interesting and as fantastic as LCD soundsystem only comes along once a decade and I'm totally fine with that I'm totally fine with that so I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it

laughing at what are you laughing at can't I just you know be happy can't I just be happy Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's jihadist music nerd we're going to do an album review like we usually do but like in the vein of my past couple videos I have a couple things to mention number one the needle drop calm has been redesigned check it out the needle drop calm looks different now and to today is the final day of our YouTube on the rise contest there's no more voting after today so if you haven't voted for us yet in the polls please do our competition is catching up we can't relax now we're at the final lap look for a link below this video in the d box head straight over there vote for t ND in the upper right hand corner and thank you and to the review Andrew Jackson jihad knife man there are a lot of albums coming out this month toward this part of the year I'm getting really overwhelmed by it but I'm happy that a lot of them are good these guys get labeled as being folk punk a lot and it's understandable they take a lot of folk instrumentation and they fuse it with a with a punk energy in an ethos but in 2009 with the album montane that they came out with they were fleshing out their sound and their style a little bit with different kinds of songs and different instrumentation electric guitars and horns and junk and this album knife man goes further down that road with lots of fat red cords esque distorted guitars kazoos piano organ strings I mean they were sounding really skeletal in 2007 with this album but now with knife man they've really done a 180 with how they stir the production value has been bumped up and I can name a lot of bands who have done that but have lost their flavor in the process these guys still feel like the same group to me they're still targeting society with the the same consistency a band like crass would personality is really what this record and ever Andrew Jackson jihad record comes down to because usually on a record from these guys the chord progressions aren't anything new being familiar familiarity is is intentional because the message is what needs to be focused on what makes knife man a little different for me is that Andrew Jackson jihad just kind of felt like they were playing these communal folk songs before but now with all this extra instrumentation in this better production they don't feel like these you know little whispers and these little stories that are passed down from person to person they feel like anthems now now I'm going to talk a little deeper about what I think my favorite thing on this album is and it will probably also be the least favorite thing of a lot of people the vocals the lead singer of this group sounds like a skinny whiny white guy it sounds like he just boils on the inside with all these nasty thoughts about the world around him and doesn't let them out until he's actually writing lyrics for his songs I mean the first lyric on this album is the Michael Jordan of drunk driving played his final game tonight I mean this guy's got some really polarizing thoughts and I don't think that's a bad thing I think it's a great thing it makes this record stick out this thing is hilariously bitter and cynical from racism to sexism to poverty to love songs and even the Sun these guys have something nasty to say about almost everything I love the track American tune which is pretty much about being a white straight male and how that kind of comes with some privilege if you live in America where you're walking down the street you're not being raped you're not being hassled by police officers I like the track no.1 which is kind of really bluesy and and depressing and about people who are poor and forgotten friendless family lists helpless there's a hilarious line on here about priests feeding sinners with fur food with diabetes inducing high fructose corn syrup and I think to me my favorite line on this album not because it's funny but it's just really it just cuts to me hope is for presidents and dreams are for people who are sleeping but the thing is you know I could see the questions popping up in people's heads who is this band who are these guys who are they to judge us judge society I would kind of feel that way a little bit too but what I think is interesting about this LP is that the preachy songs are like balanced out with these introspective and kind of self-deprecating songs where the frontman of this band sees himself as kind of being just as flawed as the general public he's critiquing I think my one issue main issue with this album is that some of the punk rock tunes on here just sound really really kind of plain they sound like any modern pop punk band that like I said earlier would kind of be on Fat Wreck chords with with kind of a poppier Punk sound but still these guys are great at coming up with lyrics and stories and images that keep me on the edge of my seat waiting to hear what the next thing is it's going to be said not only that but go back and re listen to this album to pick up things that I missed and this LP is 45 minutes long which is kind of a stretch for Andrew Jackson jihad I've enjoyed these guys plenty of times before but I never saw myself enjoying them for like 45 minutes but the thing is even though this album is a little disjointed stylistically there's like a track that's a blue song on here there's a track that's like you know a tear in your beer country jukebox kind of song like I said punk tunes there are stripped-down folky acoustic moments that feel like they could have been on earlier Andrew Jackson releases all this variety makes this album feel kind of fresh for me and makes it feel worth it to listen from beginning to end it's a little bit like a mixtape for me I loved this thing I wouldn't listen to it again I had a lot of fun listening to it um feeling a decent too strong eight on it thought it was really good but what do you think about it do you like it do you hate it is this band too preachy and and whiny for you or are they speaking to you Anthony Fantana Andrew Jackson jihad vote for us in that YouTube competition forever "},{"id":"-2BfsmZSyD8","title":"Bobby Womack- The Bravest Man In the Universe ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"did you do the thing okay yeah he's gay but you guys that packing like this can't be good for your throat bro bro bro bro call it arson hi I'm hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantan Oh your Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review bobby womack the bravest man in the universe this is the latest full-length album from ohio singer and songwriter Bobby Womack whose career spans both many years and many genres gospel funk doo-wop R&B and many more but he's best known as a soul singer despite a lot of talent a very strong voice with a very distinct personality and having written a nice handful of chart-topping singles in the 60's 70's and these Bobby's career has kind of been dwindling as well as his health unfortunately but some recent projects he's been involved in like singing the lead single off the last gorillas album performing with that live as well as being on there the fall album as well it's kind of revitalized his career and his passion as well all of the new attention on this man's voice and just his abilities has kind of snowballed into this new Damon Albarn produced studio LP and it's a collection of kind of progressive spacey colorfully produced soul songs that remind me of a few things for one the more cleanly produced tracks that bobby was putting out in the 80s as well as that strong gorillas style beat production and there's actually quite a bit of moments on this that remind me in a positive way in a positive way of Lana Del Rey is born to die and how the songs on this LP kind of have a myriad of different topics and moods but I think this whole LP kind of boils down to a vocal sample on the fourth track of this thing where you hear someone talking about a singer when they get up in age they have lived life a little bit more and because of that better understand the stories and the emotions that they're trying to convey in their songs and that is clearly the strength of Bobby on this record age has had its pros and cons on his voice and any limitations he is suffering from on this LP are just easily made up for by how well-traveled and an emotional he sounds singing on these tracks right from the intro track Bobby is singing against just this weeping cello about the bravest man in the universe being the one who can forgive first but eventually these echoing pianos start rolling in really delicately and there's just this over-the-top kind of theatrical energy to it that almost reaches a David Bowie kind of level please forgive my heart is the next track on this album the first single from this LP actually and it is just a really nice crisp modern beat with Bobby's fantastic vocals over it it feels like being gently spun on a merry-go-round underneath a starry sky the next track on your deeper River Bobby is pretty much doing a solo acoustic guitar kind of thing really chills the album out putting quickly into the tracklisting I thought Diggler reflection is actually the song on here that features Lana Del Ray on vocals and it's actually not that bad you know I don't really care for her voice all that much but the the piano chords are really sultry I wish the beat changed things up a little bit more hmm the tracks stupid is is about religious greed and has a very punchy beat nice bright piano chords it's a catchy song with a potent message and the song if there wasn't something there is just heart-wrenching however I don't think this album ends all that strongly though the song love is gonna lift you up which to me kind of feels like Bobby's story with this album that if you're still alive if there's love there there's a chance for a new beginning there's a chance for a new day there's a chance for the the Sun to shine again the lyrics feel kind of corny to be completely honest but they're sincere and I feel like with the right production they could really kind of hit home and people could really understand and and get into the message of the song but for some reason the song is just slathered in these really fake synthetic scents and it just sounds so it's like they were conscious of how corny the lyrics out-of-context with this song would sound so they just decided to purposely surround it with corny production to I don't know bring the corniness pout and the song nothing can save you is another vocal feature on here but it doesn't really add anything to this album that the the Lana Del Rey track didn't already add and the thing is that track didn't even really add that much I feel like neither of the vocal collaborations on this album feel all that collaborative there's not all that much chemistry between Bobby and whoever is a guest on the track they're just kind of trading spaces in the verses and not really doing much else the last song on here let's lose it's an interesting track it's kind of like a stop and clap Blues screamer but of course is backed up with sequence drums and synthesizer it's got a cool message about not letting other people get in your way of your passions your goals whatnot it's not really much of an ending to me kind of an anti climactic ending I guess you know I'm just kind of torn on this thing the special moments on this album are really special are just stellar but the soso tracks just kind of hold things back a lot of underwhelming moments on this album and not because these guys wanted to really get this album done fast and just throw it in the can it seems like they were more eager to kind of jump on to the next idea the next kind of experimentation the next adventure as opposed to finishing this one thing and really fleshing it out and making it something great so while I do like this album and maybe not even a ton I do think there is something special about the aesthetic of the cell either something special about Bobby's voice his personality and the personality of the best songs on this album I would love to see Bobby put out another album next year or the year after I hope this is not just a one-shot thing I know this record has not been one of the hottest to come out this year so I hope that doesn't prevent him from releasing new material in the near future but we're gonna see I'm feeling a strong sex on this LP what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Bobby Womack forever you "},{"id":"3CrD91zHkLg","title":"The Voidz - Virtue ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone breathe the knee deep tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new voids album of virtue this is the second full-length album from art pop and experimental rock outfit the voids formerly known as Julian Casablancas and the voids because the band was formed by the famed New York singer and strokes frontman and they've changed their name simply to the voids I guess in the spirit of unity cohesion I don't know but what I do know is I thought their last full-length album tyranny was a pretty good record the record contained the very immediate balladry and compelling rock songwriting that you usually get in anything almost anything connected to Julian Casablancas but then there was also something about the band that was totally out there super indulgent which gave their music this very weird edge in all of the guitar riffs on this thing that were super abrasive super grating the somewhat muddy very walked out mixes and then there were also tracks on this thing that were like these monstrously sad and spacious ten-minute odyssey's like human sadness even though some parts of this record might have been a little difficult to digest there was something kind of thrilling about its unorthodoxy for me which is something I was hoping to get a second helping of on this new album over here now by comparison I don't think virtue is nearly as noisy or as abstract as its predecessor pretty much all the songs on this thing have some pretty straightforward hooks all the tracks round out at an average length of time but I do think Julian maintains quite a bit of lyrical personality on this album even if some elements of it are a bit more tame and on the whole I think this album is a more versatile record than tyranny to the point where it is much more difficult to pin down this thing dishes out numerous warped risky Tunes that kind of add up into a really admirable freak show even if it does kick things off kind of mild with the track leave it in my dreams which sonically is coming from very familiar terra-tory there's just something about the pacing of the song that feels like a strokes track but maybe it's just a bit sassier and instrumentally a lot odder of course with these mutant guitar solos and some weird synths and and very strange vocalizations from Julian at some points on the track as he's going into his upper register he really is letting loose on this one but then immediately after this very mild but enjoyable song voids just throw listeners into the raging rapids with curious this thing is like a moody post-punk II piece of Middle Eastern electro fit with some weird auto-tune solos on the back end that are reminiscent of Kanye West's 808s and heartbreak yeah it's it's it's that all over the place the tune is super solid too with some hooky background vocals that stick into my head instantly an undeniable groove as well the song pyramid of Bones is one of the most blatantly political songs on the entire record talking about don't believe the the white man's lies man yeah at some points on this record Julian's lyrics sound like the ravings of a mad but honestly if I was gonna listen to a mad hippy ranting in 2018 this this is the soundtrack I would want it to happen to all of Julian's words about propaganda and disinformation are set to these incredibly driving crunchy guitar riffs and there's a weirdly gothic instrumental bridge on this track that goes over really well a very noisy ending to the song permanent high school is yet another track that at its core feels like a very sad dreary strokes tune but there's enough change up instrumentally and aesthetically that it feels refreshing and interesting I feel somewhat similarly about the very soulful and sweet track lazyboy which features some great drum guitar syncopations the song alienation feels like I'm listening to very sad sanitized futuristic elevator music like I'm like I'm riding up the elevator at my desk job in the year 2048 and I know that once I reached the top floor I'm gonna get fired the instrumental and the vocals on this track are just are just life sucking and I mean that in the best way possible another highlight on this thing is the incredibly funky all words are made up this thing is like polyrhythmic junkyard synth funk for spin-doctors fans in the apocalypse there's some very odd harmonized robot vocals at some point on the song - that really stuck with me and this is one of many tracks on this record that not only blends numerous genres together into a violently catchy cacophony but also it's it's one of a few tracks here that feels like it's living in the past present and future all at the same time the song think before you drink is a decent acoustic centerpiece on the album the acoustic guitar just kind of serves as a foundation for this story that Julian tells about being young being safe being protected and then as he grows older goes out into the world goes to school he's being lied to he's being poisoned he's being ushered into the mentality of the status quo Julian Casablanca is so freaking woke again it's kind of pretentious it's it's kind of like wake up sheeple but the way that he frames it it's kind of hard to disagree with it while recently Julian Casablancas may have done that little vulture interview where he said tons of ridiculous things the way that he framed some of his ideas in his lyrics are so general that you can really apply what he's saying to a lot of different perspectives in a way I feel like a lot of what Julian is saying here is indicative of this immense amount of distrust that I feel like everyone has for the world around them right now what's unfortunate for me after this track is that the album it's a pretty major lull starting off with the song wink another track on the album that's pretty out there pretty odd but at the end of the day I feel like this is one of the experiments that could have been left on the cutting room floor I mean it sounds like Julian crooning needlessly over an endless Vampire Weekend demo instrumentally it's super rough do not think the guitar line fits into this track at all the instrumental is super repetitive super tedious you've heard pretty much everything the song has to offer by the halfway point the song finishes like this oddly long fade-out that just kind of brings the song to a fizzled ending while not as awful instrumentally the following two tracks my friend the walls in pink ocean are nearly as tedious thankfully the song black hole kind of flies in toward the back end of the record and breaks up this pattern of monotony with these thumping kick drums and burning fuzzy roaring bass and these guitar Lee that are kind of layered over one another and have a very sour sound of them and the intensity of this track is is just really smothered aggressively by a song just a few tracks down the road which is maybe the most explosive and aggressive song the entire album has to offer the band suddenly tones things down with the pretty powerful closer pointlessness the track just feels like being slowly swallowed in this digital hopelessness occasionally these rays of light shine down through Julian Casablanca says falsetto but they sort of disappear that they're not staying it's oh it's hopeless it's over it's done you know this was just a quality batshit rock album you know and and it's pretty sweet cuz we just had another one with that Jack White Album I felt like Julian and the band were just doing their best to advance the sound of this genre bring other competing ideas and sounds into it while maintaining the rage and the in the wild demeanor that made it so great to begin with this is the kind of blended everything but the kitchen sink experimentation I would just love to hear going forward and there were just a lot of great highlights on this record from front to back now there were a handful of songs that to me felt like the band wasn't pushing it far enough honestly and a few tracks where I felt like they rested a little bit too much on how weird a song sounded for its entertainment value as opposed to just making sure that there's a good song at the core of that track still though even at its worst what the voids are trying to pull off on this record is at least admirable and even though virtue was a bit shorter than its predecessor I still think this thing was a bit bloated like a couple of the paler songs on this thing could have been left on the cutting room floor would have made a tighter more exciting experience but still feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video you can

everyone dance the need arctan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Crystal Castles record amnesty one this is the latest full-length LP from popular indie electronic duo Crystal Castles the first album that's been released under this project's name since the departure of the duo's famed front woman Alice glass and since then she has been replaced by one Miss Edith Frances now the teaser tracks from this thing honestly didn't give me high hopes for the record and even if Alice glass was still working with Ethan cath on this record and I had heard no songs leading up to the release of this album I would still be kind of skeptical because Crystal Castles last album was easily their worst thus far but dude this barely cobbled together album failed to meet my very low expectations as Crystal Castles is no longer creating the alternative and stylish electronic dance music that made them so popular in the late 2000s there are a couple moments on this record that sound like faint rehashes of Crystal Castles songs that would have been decent if they had come out around 2008 or 2009 with Ethan composing some quirky but also kind of moody since escapes and of course these are topped with Edith Frances performing a completely charmless Alice glass impression an example of that would be on the song char but then we have cuts like frail for example which has this banging awesome house beat really buzzing dissonant just sour synthesizers that are bright and siren-like but on here Edith sounds like you'll Andy Visser of Dion's Road as she's kind of yelping in this very high pitch against the noisy instrumental Ethan and Edith make it pretty clear from the get-go that they have no other plans for her than to just force her to live in Alice's shadow despite the fact that her aggressive yell P smudged and distorted singing only brings a fraction of the excitement that Alice's did from the sound of the vocals on this project ethan clearly feels like alice was just a placeholder and didn't really have anything to do with the success of the duo and could just be easily replaced by anybody but the results speak for themselves that's really not the case but not all of the issues on this record can be attributed to Edith there are also a handful of tracks that end really abruptly don't have much in terms of significant song structure are really redundant boring the song teach her how to hunt is a very droney and forgettable interlude that doesn't add anything to the track listing here and the song ornament is as forgettable as it is breezy now when ethan isn't trying to drill for oil in the same dry reservoirs that Crystal Castles have already just sucked out completely on previous records he's doing things like throwing rattling trap high hats into his beats which I will leave it up to you as to whether or not that's working and then there are several cuts on here which feature these super distorted and overblown just way too loud synth leads that are just trying way too hard to be edgy sort of like something that would have gone over well in an industrial club in the late 90s but just sounds kind of silly and out of place today talking about songs like fleece and sadist for example unfortunately there are just so many things working against the success of this record anemic song structures and lengths this is the shortest Crystal Castles album to date lackluster lead vocals lackluster song ideas and occasionally just trying a little too hard to to be edgy there are only a couple instrumentals on this thing that I like and a handful of tracks that I think Crystal Castles at least pulls together a decent aesthetic at least Ethan can still produce a dance track that's kind of harsh and moody as well as physical which will most likely be enough for fans of the duo who weren't into them for anything more than that anyway while I do think there's gonna be a Crystal Castles diehard here and there who think this record is really great I think I personally can say that this is Crystal Castles worst album to date and by a pretty noticeable margin I'm feeling a strong three to Lake for on this thing transition and those are my complete thoughts on this new Crystal Castles record did you give this out Melissa did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it are the best you that us so should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please subscribe and uh yeah that's all also don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this record but you're welcome to

"},{"id":"GyXofB1k24A","title":"Jack White - Boarding House Reach ALBUM REVIEW","y":10,"x":"Hey hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jack white album boarding house reach songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer formerly one half of the White Stripes mr. Jack white out with a brand new commercial album his third commercial solo album and I use the word commercial very loosely here because there's not much about this album that is that is very commercial this is maybe Jack White's most unmarketable album yet to the point where I'm not quite sure what to make of some of this record but simultaneously I can't help but be in awe of just how off the deep-end Jack White is on this album I'm so happy I am so so happy that he has broken the cycle of writing coffee house Rock of writing tote bag rock on his past two records blunderbuss and Lazaretto both of which are decent albums I think they're decent albums they're listenable they're fine but are they as top-notch as previous material from the White Stripes are they as exciting are they cutting edge and both records to me at the end of the day just kind of felt like mild exercises in blues rock and garage rock revivalism with kind of a singer/songwriter flair boarding house reached though by comparison is much more experimental but somehow more aggressive and more hard-hitting as well to the point where I think a lot of Jack White's hardcore listeners might react to this album somewhat negatively because it is kind of a kooky album and goes against the consistency Jack White has delivered over the years because boarding house reach not only explores the hard rock and the blues rock and the garage rock that Jack white is known for but also elements of funk and electronic music and art an experimental rock some of the production on this thing is kind of glitchy and noisy and very abrasive they're elements where I feel like he's he's throwing in these little interstitial instrumental bits some of which may be original some of which may be sampled and it sort of sounds like he's pulling together some kind of maximalist hip hop beat where he's constantly just throwing samples in your face or different musical bits a lot of the production on this thing is very intricate very complex and kind of a psychedelic surreal it's almost like on this album Jack is rebelling against himself against everything he's sort of built his name on up until this point away which to me is something that definitely comes through on the opening track to this record connected by love a song that originally I hated I hated this song when I first heard it I was convinced this was like Jack White's worst song period the song is backed with this really stiff instrumental this cycling roaring buzzing synthetic bass line a very simple slow kick drum pattern swinging hypnotically against these skittering weird percussive bits kind of panning from the left to the right channel but Jack White's vocal performance is what ended up kind of winning me over on this song because not only do his lyrics on this track have these subtle nods to technology with him being connected to this person by love but also there's this amazingly nervous tension in his vocal performance that is pretty incredible there are many points on the song where it just sounds like Jack White is ready to pop that and the swelling wall of instrumentation on the chorus are truly what really kind of makes the song fulfilling and interesting also the aesthetics of the song are kind of at war with themselves with Jack's voice the rock instrumentation the electronic bits also these weird chirpy background singers definitely some of the weirdest background singers I've heard on a jack white track ever again even though I was feeling very negatively toward this song when I first listened to it it has grown on me to be one of his boldest ballads yet and there are a handful of other tracks that kind of are a bit of an aesthetic and anachronistic clash of electronic and acoustic instrumentation the song why walk a dog has the sequence drums in three it's it's kind of like a very stiff electro blues tune but it's very dark it's very downtrodden it's very depressed features these watery serene kind of trippy synthesizers that they kind of have a bit of an organ tone to them the buzzing synth bass on this track is kind of intense too and Jack White's vocal performance is so dark and the lyrics to me just kind of feels like he's detailing a relationship but not necessarily a romantic one one where he is being treated as the lesser as like a commercial product really what I think he's trying to describe on this track is just being used being viewed as like just an object which might be in line with a few moments on this album where it seems like jack is kind of commenting on creativity and commercialism and the commodification of art and music honestly the only issue I have with the song is I wish it was longer I just love the the sound of the track I love the loud gargantuan mutant guitar solo of which there are many on this record like there are a lot of guitar solos that are just like fuzzed and burned out and glitched out and just like freaky as hell there's also on the back end of the record a country tinged ballad performed in close vocal harmony on the song what's done is done it kind of reminds me in a way of a lot of tracks off of the new Justin Timberlake record where you have this melding of vocals some folk instrumentation some synthetic drums however in this instance it doesn't sound like total crap no it actually sounds good like the way that the electronics balance out with the acoustic instrumentation is tasteful the vocals sound great and the tune is really dark and compelling too but really where this album is at its best for me are on these exciting fusions of rock and electronic music and funk songs like corporation which to me reads almost like a lick or a groove out of an old meters song the groove on the song is hard it's nasty the drums are exciting it's just it's just pure experimental fun on this track with all these you know weird little shouty refrains with Jack White making these proclamations about wanting to start a corporation and that's how these days you get any adulation again this track bringing back the themes of commercialism and corporatism and greed the track hyper me so phony AK which I might be mispronouncing is another funky experimental cut on the record although it may be it's the one moment where I feel like Jack really truly goes overboard with the ascending and descending like clicking and cycling synthesized that are mixed so hard they're just like completely in the right channel they're just kind of blue throughout the entirety of the track with almost no change whatsoever the rest of the mix is packed with like these flashy jazzy saloon pianos loud roaring guitars booming drums these really twisted vocal manipulations so when like a background vocal pops into the mix sometimes it'll be at a normal pitch sometimes it'll sound like it's melting before your ears it's a little difficult to listen to you for me even now but still and I'm kind of in awe of just how cacophonous the track is the song Ice Station zebra is just as bold just as funky but there's a lot more organization and harmony to the instrumentation the instrumental on this song is really just too intricate and insane for me to even begin to start describing but really what kind of cells this song for me our Jack White's shouty pretty much wrapped vocals on the song which after listening to it multiple times it just kind of hit me this is so bec like Jack was just listening to odelay Arabic mellow gold Arabic and and this was just like could have possibly been an inspiration for this his lyrics on the track or absurdists they're silly they're kind of tongue-in-cheek at points but there are a lot of moments where it seems like he's making reference to creativity the creative process saying that all people who are making something or copying God and then there's the very explosive over and over and over over and over when Emma no ma'am killer groove killer productions super fuzzy freaky guitars on this thing this was one of the tracks that I heard prior to the release of the album that got me thinking well you know actually this this could be a great album this could potentially be good and and maybe Jack White experimenting with more groovy instrumentation and more electronics might might be a good thing might be a good thing and I got to tell you with the rest of this album growing on me this song has just like become so fantastic to me the sound play is just top-notch on this track and Jack works in so many interesting little instrumental bits just in between the grooves or different passages and sections of the song again kind of reminds me of like a hip hop beador an old-school hip-hop instrumental where all of a sudden a DJ would just like throw a drum break or a horn break or something into a track just to change things up or provide a different sound or tone or vibe and the song respect commanders is separated into two distinct parts the introductory moment of the track feels like a rock band trying to recreate the the days of like 80s electro funk with these speedy like clockwork drum beats these old-school gargantuan synth hits whoo whoo the production is kind of trippy and psychedelic too it feels like again a rock band trying to recreate like a in Afrika Bambaataa instrumental and then all of a sudden we transition into this slow heavy just foreboding hardrock music where Jack White is singing about respecting a woman and she's basically at her command it kind of kind of makes a the idea of respecting the fair sex seemed like kind of dark and kinky then there are some really odd spoken-word moments on the record like getting the mind shaft which feels like like something pulled straight out of The Flaming Lips playbook later the track transitions into this really funky psychedelia with talkbox vocals and very playful grooves as colorful as it all is it's still pretty abrasive and weird and there are a handful of kind of short somewhat gimmicky interstitial tracks that bring the album from one section to the next the song everything you've ever learned sounds like a commercial for a dystopian future with Jack white in a very kind of eerie announcer voice talking about oh this is a advertisement for everything you've ever learned the song Esmeralda steals the show is this really odd story song set to acoustic guitar it's like a poetic story and Jack white is kind of performing the song and two different voices and two different vocal styles in each channel kind of reminds me of The Velvet Underground a little bit and the fourth track of the record which I'm not even going to try to pronounce please just show the title of that thank you very much is a little poetic bit performed by CW Stoneking it's very dramatic it's very theatrical almost feels like he's performing in character on the song the poetry is set to this really dramatic violin music that sort of sounds like it's from the Eastern Bloc and the finishing track of the album is maybe the one spot on the record that kind of let me down a little bit it feels like kind of a forgettable moment even though I do kind of like the jazzy smooth lullaby ish change of pace of the instrumentation the melody and obviously this is reference in the title of the song itself is a play on a Dvorak song I'm terrible when it comes to classical music to just just leave me alone but still like I'm super impressed with this record I did not think I was gonna like it at all but honestly I've expected way more of Jack White than he's actually been delivering since he went solo four years four years given just how eccentric he is and how left-field he portrays himself to be I feel like this is the kind of thing we should have been hearing almost all along this record is such a creative display of texture and sound and color and Composition it's an aesthetic rush it's incredibly dynamic it's challenging and it's overwhelming and yet it's very methodically composed like you can definitely digest it but it hits you with a lot but at the end of the day Jack clearly wanted to come through with a focused and a catchy and a coherent album so you know I just love controlled creative chaos and and that's what this album is to me I like a lot of the lyrical and conceptual themes that kind of reveal themselves as I listen to the album again and again I feel like this record really works in layers there are so many amazing details I can come back to and pick up as I listen to the album again and again and again and in a lot of ways I feel like Jack is making a record that is truly reflective of the over saturation of the information age and simultaneously rebelling against modern rock orthodoxy and for me this album is also proof that whether or not rock music is refreshing or is pushing the envelope is dependent wholly on whether or not the artist is willing to take it there all right I'm going to leave it at that love this record great record fantastic record feeling a decent too strong 9 on this album transition did you give this album a listen did you love it did you hate

of the new Deerhoof record la snap bonito 20 years as a band and I believe this is their 13th full-length album if I'm wrong on that I'm sure in the comments you'll correct me over the years that they have been a band they've undergone numerous lineups some sound changes but it wasn't the 2000s that they kind of evolved into this style that they're working with currently which has made them one of the most fun-loving idiosyncratic rock and pop groups in the underground Deerhoof is one of those groups that sounds unique as a whole because there are so many unique individual parts that go into the finished product so Tomi is very light hi childlike vocals as well as her kind of esoteric and absurd lyrics Greg's very aggressive frantic groovy and danceable drumbeats and John and Ed's very sharp angular and sometimes very dissonant guitar leads the band is also well known for using some pretty strange chord progressions on their tracks - or time signatures and even though Deerhoof has settled into a pretty familiar style at this point they do make sure to throw in a few left hooks or surprises into every release they are constantly creative and in my opinion rarely disappoint if you're new to the band I suggest you try anything from the album apple o to friend opportunity but as far as their more recent stuff goes we have the album offend Maggie which was easily one of their most straightforward distorted and rough albums so far maybe even to a slight fault because so many of the songs on this record in my opinion sound very much the same because of the kind of harsh recording then we have versus evil which by contrast was a very dynamic and lush record at times with some of dear hopes most tender and beautiful songs yet while delivering their their usual collection of very uppity poppy catchy very fun tracks as well and on the record breakup song their previous record they experimented quite a on some tracks with some electronics some samples but on their latest here lie they seem to be getting back to basics not really fooling around with anything else other than the guitars drums and vocals that we know them for much like a fan Maggie this record has kind of a rough sound to it it's a little grimy the sound of the music here really speaks to the cover are you're looking at something kind of black and white grayscale but it's kind of distorted and warped too it's like watching epic Saturday morning cartoons on an old old television that is seriously on the fritz as you consume massive amounts of the most sugary cereals known to man the drums on this record they're loud they're booming they're harsh the bass is very resonant the guitars are very sharp and shrill and have kind of a very metallic tone to them they are sunburnt and so Tony's vocals are very loud they're very close in this loudness in this straightforwardness again this record reminds me of a fen Maggie but I think Deerhoof comes off a little more dynamic on this record writing some softer tracks some prettier tracks too and simultaneously deer hoof in my opinion actually delivers some of their heaviest material as well on this record this isn't the first time deer hoof has work with quirky extremes on a record of theirs and they do it again here pretty well too we have the song big house waltz which has this huge massive bass drone on it that's fit up against this killer drum be some awesome guitar melodies so Tomi brings forward these vocals at one point that sound like she's like a ringleader at a circus there's a really strange guitar passage toward the back end with the track deer hoof they might be writing something catchy but they always find a way to throw a wrench in the works and do something weird and the song exit only has one of the most aggressive heavy and hard-hitting drum beats and guitar riffs to ever land on a deer cuff album ever there's the song mirror monster one of the more gentle tracks on the LP that features all these fluttering guitars there's some very tender vocal melodies and harmonies on this thing I love the way the chord progression of this track ascends and resolves and there's the song black pitch which has this very twinkly pretty guitar intro that sounds a lot like something that would have been more marketable in the indie scene in the 2000s when Deerhoof was doing much weirder stuff as much as I like the harsh moments on this record it's nice to hear some pretty songs as well especially since the more beautiful spots were what attracted me so much to versus evil the one major downside to this track is the kind of abrupt ending and the closer Oh bummer is is another track that is a little softer a little more melodic though this track is maybe the dreariest of any song on the record with a vocal melody that's that's absolutely nightmarish and emotionally painful and Deerhoof make sure to balance tracks like this out with songs that are unbearably fun like the song doom which is loaded with melodies that sound like I'm on a psychedelic island filled with squawking polkadot parrots and dancing coconuts there's some pretty male/female vocals on this track as well and this is one of the few tracks on the record that kind of follows in an unpredictable linear structure there are a few tracks on this record that are kind of average for Deerhoof like paradise girls not amazing or totally new song for them but this track would be nice on a mix for a girl who is smart and plays bass guitar because that's what the song is about a girl who is smart and plays bass guitar and I wish the song God to was longer it's a really great instrumental that I wish just had more length to it and I wish that for a few other tracks on here too as creative and as fun as some of these songs are I kind of feel like Deerhoof came in brought some interesting ideas brought a great recording but sort of dipped out early on some of these tracks to me this is another entertaining album from Dieruff I wouldn't say there's anything incredibly ambitious about it in comparison with other Dieruff releases or that there's really anything that fantastic about the flow of this album either for sure there's a nice variety of songs here but it still kind of just feels like a standard mixed bag of tracks whose only continuous thread is the band style and the kind of Bhoomi shrill production what ends up saving this record and makes it great to listen to is that we have a lot of good songs here very good quirky fun rock songs that are sweet and very enjoyable in there unorthodoxy I'm feeling strong seven on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you look did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yeah Anthony Fantan oh dear huff forever "},{"id":"r3OLn4vaBzw","title":"Ugly God - The Booty Tape MIXTAPE REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone what a nature Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new booty tape from ugly god ugly god is a texas-based rapper and a 20-17 double XL freshman who's been turning a lot of heads over the past year or so with some pretty big internet hits most notably the very viral water a splash on you bitch worth of water especially in your bitch leg water especially inhibition of the water water water Lauda wada this guy is a lot of push he has a lot of hype he has a lot of attention however all that attention is sort of centered around this handful of songs that have done pretty well online he up until this point has not had a sizable album or mixtape to speak of until now wit da booty tape now from the material I've heard from this guy so far I think ugly God has potential he's kind of eccentric as a sense of humor he approaches song topics and kind of a weird quirky left-field way sometimes he drops a lot of crazy self-deprecating bars and he's not just simply one of these completely flow lists and rhythm deficient mumble rappers most of the time and that's the thing ugly God is kind of inconsistent not every single he's been dropping over the past year or so has been heat and also case in point just look at the vast difference in quality between his double XL freestyle and his double XL cypher performance which sounded like a test he didn't study for so I don't know I just went into this new tape hopeful hoping that ugly God would either figure out a way to transcend his meme status in the rap realm or actually prove that he is the clown that hip-hop needs right now and honestly the booty tape doesn't either I mean this thing is 10 mostly mediocre tracks the best of which we've actually heard already I mean water is on this thing and being excited to hear water at the very end of the booty tape is like being excited to hear hotline bling at the end of views I mean not only that but the song as days are numbered I mean it's a viral hit it's a big song but I mean half of the lyrical references on this thing are going to be irrelevant or nearly irrelevant in the next two two three years it's a fun song but its shelf life is obviously going to be short though I do like the recently released track fuck ugly God on this thing it's this amazing embarrassing diss track to himself I've never heard such a thing before it's really revealing and funny and clever but you know leave it to a guy named ugly God to make that sort of thing happen sadly the rest of the tape isn't really graced with the same stroke of unforeseen genius none of the song topics on this thing are nearly as interesting with maybe the exception of the very demeaning and very mean-spirited stop smokin Black & Mild which is almost too mean of a song every single bar on this thing is meant to just mercilessly put down this girl for being trashy as if God is one to talk but another issue I have with the track is that it's one of many cuts on this thing that runs really short feels pretty under written kind of attention decision it's like almost each song on this thing is based off of a joke that gets really not funny really fast kind of like a vine that goes on too long for example the song LBC which stands for little dick click ugly til I die I ripped that little dick clip which i think is a hilarious chorus I think is a hilarious song idea which almost has infinite possibilities well you know maybe not infinite possibilities but certainly more possibilities than what ugly God actually presented here you really could have thrown any course on this track assembled them with these verses and you would have nearly the same results the supposed concept is gold ugly God just doesn't do anything with it for the most part I mean this thing is kind of just generic filler trap the beats are kind of Spacey they're kind of pretty a lot of ugly gods flows are very average and run-of-the-mill sometimes he drops a very lewd or very nasty or a very kind of silly bar here and there but it's all just kind of loose change it doesn't add up too much and even when it does putting it out there's about as embarrassing as just taking to fat pocketful of quarters and slamming them down on the counter at the convenience sort of pay for some shit there's just a lot of material on this thing we're ugly God comes off really average or just straight boring I'm a nasty ho like a maverick the song bitch as well and ugly god and Wiz Khalifa is one of the most awkward and unnecessary rap pairings I've heard this year on the whole there's nothing really all that great or exciting about this tape to be completely honest it just kind of sounds like ugly God didn't put in the amount of effort required to really build up a satisfying 10 track project he just patted it out with these forgettable songs which are more miss than they are hit and that's kind of it you know I think maybe going forward ugly guys should just continue to focus on just putting together strong singles because any internet age in the age of streaming in the age of viral music videos on YouTube I think there is a lane for a more singles based rap artists I mean singles are exactly how ugly guys got to this point in the first place so why fix what's not broken I guess and sure at some point in the future I would be interested to hear an album or a tape or whatever from ugly god but only if he puts the same amount of effort into each song rather than just packing the tracklist out with filler I'm feeling a strong four to a life five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best but your dire view next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry next to my head

the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Heinz album over here the band's name is Heinz and the title of this thing leave me alone Heinz is a Spanish garage rock outfit this is their debut full-length LP and this album of theirs has a very particular sound to it it's like all of the echoes from the female fronted post-punk and twee music from the UK and Scotland throughout the 70s and 80s that carried over onto the hazy lazy loaf I sunny Beach rock of the west coast in the US just went right over that Atlantic Ocean landed right in California and then somehow the signal bounced back over to the shores of Spain and now we have this band the result is a set of sloppy fun playful little Beach and garage rock tunes that have a lot of attitude and whether or not that makes up for the very obvious lack of it of experience in the instrument playing and the songwriting is sort of up to you but for me a lot of the time despite that the band draws up a pretty sweet and endearing sound it's breezy it doesn't really cause you to face any difficult emotions or personal demons or anything like that it's the sound of no responsibilities or pressures and if you're looking for some kind of musical outlet to unwind with this might be the record for you but there's nothing really about the goodtime had on this record that makes me want to commit to it come back to it it's just something that's kind of casually entertaining while it's on like I really want to join in with the drunken slurred karaoke style wawas and DAWs on tracks like warts in San Diego like some people I had fun with at the bar but nobody who I would want to hang out with again or take home or anything like that mostly because once you get beyond sort of that drunken haze of fun that's being had there's really not much going on just a lot of very tedious instrumental bits and and song writing the tracks on this record are is rudimentary as they are kind of cliched and their shortcomings make themselves very apparent very quickly if you happen to be having a sober listen to this thing though I will say again for some people I think the sound of the band having fun on this record will make the music here really palatable and will get you kind of wrapped up in it this thing is just really like the taste of the cheap beer and cigarettes that you shared with your friends when you stole them from your older brothers or your dad's secret stash and that's kind of this record in a nutshell I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition thank you for watching have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it does it did it did it resonate with you a little bit more than it did with me I mean it was generally a fun record you know some sweet little tunes on there here and here and there but just very breezy very breezy I hope you're doing well and you do best Hines music leave me alone forever

the new David Byrne album American utopia David Byrne one of the most enigmatic musical figures of the 1970s and 80s is back with a new full-length album his first solo record in like 14 years or so the last of which was grown backwards however David Byrne has kept himself really busy in between these two plot points he has been working on soundtrack music and he's had a slew of collaborations one of the biggest of which was that great record he had with annie clark of saint vincent love this giant another project between this album and his last that is really stuck with me is his brian eno collaboration everything that happens will happen today an album that was just this pristinely produced futuristic art pop album which made me feel like i was living inside of a perfect polite society where everyone wears white suits the workdays are short the days are always sunny and everyone takes their dog out for a walk at 8:00 a.m. sharp and now David Byrne returning with American utopia I'm kind of catching a lot of the same themes and vibes that I was off everything that happens but it delivered in a different fashion American utopia deals pretty deeply in the ideas of paradise and bliss and conformity with some added nods to darkness and American politics as well as hyper awareness of things like body parts and the brain a cockroach living in the cosmos of your house and the the sentient of a chicken I read that this album was kind of a grand statement on US politics and it also has a very kind of hopeful angle it looks positively toward the future if that is the case I didn't quite get that at least not in spades there are some tracks on here that are very clearly political without a doubt but for the most part I think a lot of this record boils down to many of the same societal critiques that David Byrne has always laced very subtly in his music throughout the years another familiar thing about can you tow Pia is that it is instrumentally dense it is deeply groovy and also emotionally awkward but I guess with a new fresh very vibrant instrumental palette this album is a very tight 10 tracks in 37 minutes and it's got a pretty decent batch of highlights within it too like the tropical island funk on the song every day is a miracle which is as feel-good as the title suggests the intro the verse of the song though is pretty dramatic builds tension very nicely features David Byrne just calling out and waxing poetic on things like God as well as elephants not being able to read newspapers and loving one another the chorus is fantastically rich as I said earlier really feel good and I love how he just kind of comes together with a lot of different musical shifts throughout this track I mean the contrast he creates on the bridge of the song has kind of a dystopian edge to it that I like a lot be very short but heavenly dogs mind is another track on here I enjoyed a lot a song that's really the most bold political statement on the entire record as David Byrne uses the blissful ignorance of a dog's life as a parallel or a comparison to the lack of influence and impact and control that the electorate has over the powerful over people like the president over our politicians the equally euphoric track bullet reaches a heavenly peak as well despite the fact that it's it's such a morbid song the springy guitar leads on this track as well as the vocal harmonies that David Byrne brings to the table are really lovely but the intro is pretty dark and there are some other tracks on here that take kind of a dark turn they're a little edgy and have some hard grooves to the songs it's not dark up here and everybody's coming to my house two of my favorite tracks on the entire record not only because they're well produced great beats great bass lines good good lyrics as well but for me these two tracks are emblematic of just the spirit of the Talking Heads still existing to this day and David Burns music but with just a I guess kind of a sadder dreary er aesthetic to kind of match the social climate of today where this album does fall short for me though is in in a few different areas for one the flow and the pacing of this record it just kind of feels like a compilation at the end of the day there are some tracks on here that they didn't the track listing are not that great kind of pale in comparison to others or change sounds or change moods so wildly that it doesn't really fit in with the record the song here is maybe the clearest example of that as a closer as a finisher it doesn't really make much sense it doesn't really tie the album up all that much it's a very intriguing song about different portions of the brain serving different purposes but I don't know just the the instrumental feel so sterile and feels so alien in comparison with all the rich groovy instrumentation that kind of packs out the rest of the album there are some points on here where I feel like the album falls short on lyrics as well like on I dance like this which to me was a moment on the record that came off kind of plain and underwhelming as far as David Burns language I know he's not known for being all that flowery with the the words he chooses he's typically pretty blunt pretty straightforward but with that occasionally I feel like he borders on being mundane like on the song doing the right thing where it feels like he's doing his best to try to I guess Lampoon these really drab and self-absorbed tourists but he just kind of ends up embodying those things himself on the track a few of the vocal performances on here are a little weak leave a bit to be desired and occasionally the awkwardness of this record does permeate the music so much that I feel like it holds it back a little bit mostly on the song this is that which was a really syrupy kind of unfulfilled ballad that never really truly got started got its momentum up for me still overall it's not really that bad of an album generally I think it's pretty good it's some pretty forward-thinking art pop with a lot of interesting instrumentation good production good songwriting and a unique persona that only a guy like David Byrne can bring to an album I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

REVIEW","y":6,"x":"Chadd t sol can you even see me since dude oh here we go girlfriend got me this shirt Anthony Fantan oh here everybody hope all y'all are doing well and I'm shooting what I assume is going to be my last video of 2010 next time I put out a video it's gonna be 2011 before I get into this I want to make a huge announcement link down there in the D box what has two thumbs and was featured on the front page of YouTube's trends blog this guy this guy my favorite albums of 2010 video is right there on the front page pretty amazing just go check it out check it out check it out check it out so what does one do at a time like this reviews music review music of course I mean it's like review music so we do here come on we're gonna talk about the new shad album t sol a while ago maybe not more than a week when I said I was kind of in a hip-hop mood somebody suggested that I check out this album and when I checked it out I discovered an MC who to me is really admirable shad is Canadian this is his third LP coming off of the high of the Polaris Prize nominated second album that he put out and if you like your hip-hop to stay away from all of that bragging from all of that tough-guy bull then this should most definitely get you going rather than rapping about himself endlessly shad hops from subject to subject love racism politics family the rap game all that socially conscious jazz and when he actually does get around to talking about himself it's not necessarily a pretty sight the world sucks we all know this and I feel for an emcee to come along and just rap about that is no real feat anybody could do that however if someone can be poetic about it if somebody can be very clever about it if somebody can make a listener think if someone can make a listener sympathize that to me is a talent that to me is a skill and bringing thought-provoking wordplay to the table is something that shad definitely does their tracks on here like Rose Garden and yeah I get it that send a lot of messages in the rhymes on a lot of levels but don't weigh themselves down in a ton of depressing emotions so there's a positivism there but then again there's this reality thing they're going on to like yeah things are hard but we don't necessarily need to beat ourselves up over it however there are points here where I'm really not enjoying the album all that much tracks that to me are kind of like a tear-stained diary page like telephone for example I don't mind tracks like this from a lyrical perspective though what I don't like is when the track basically tries to force these depressing emotions down your throat by using all of this sad sappy instrumentation slow R&B vocals it just feels like you're trying too hard at that point to get some tears welling in the listeners eyes and there are just a handful of hooks on this album that I just can't get down with like a good name for example where shad gets his name spelled out in the hook sh-sh ad it's an O M ETH OD man but whatever and on the track we are the ones where he's trying to sing and the really difficult melody there on that chorus line just not doing too much for me when it comes to rhymes here shad is really on the ball the only issue I really have is that he uses a lot of similes and I know that's popular in rap don't freak out don't freak out all I'm saying is that he goes a little overboard with them this is like that that is like this there's a lot of that thrown around for the most part I just wish the beats and the production were a little bit better in some ways this album actually reminds me of a rap LP I love a lot fashion's Boy Meets World however it's really only reminding me of that not amazing me as much as that is what I'm trying to say now that I know about this guy and I see that he has a good thing going I'm gonna be watching him I just hope that he tears it up on some mixtapes in the near future I think that would be pretty awesome overall for me it's a likeable album I didn't feel like I was anywhere close to falling in love with it though which you know it's kind of making me feel a strong six maybe a light seven on this thing but if you're into hip-hop if you're looking for some rap with an alternative personality then most definitely check this out it's worth the listen okay shad T sol the needle drop Anthony Fantana forever "},{"id":"y39aOgNMgik","title":"Arctic Monkeys- Suck It and See ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"Arctic Monkeys suck it in see no no no no hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music do I have anything mighty music nerd it's time for an album review Arctic Monkeys suck it and see a lot can happen in five years and Arctic Monkeys are proof because just five years ago these guys burst onto the scene with this energetic and modern indie rock post-punk hybrid that just felt really fresh at the time and now it's 2011 we've got sucking in sea and Arctic Monkeys are playing a style of rock that sounds like every Arctic Monkeys released before this one never happened not only that but every Punk album to ever exist never happened either even on humbug there were a few moments that that that slightly acknowledged the influence of the fall slightly oh you got to say I was I was a little misled on this album because the Arctic Monkeys kind of pulled a single switcheroo which is when a band takes the most terrible and untolerable songs on their album and releases them as singles before the album is out because come on brick by brick and don't sit down because I've moved your chair brick by brick sounds like an over glorified and over constricted garage rock song the only thing slightly rebellious about it is that its volume kind of hangs in the yellow the groove and the guitar leads are pretty decent but I really do not like the deep-voiced backup vocals and the lyrics about wanting to rock and roll because honestly at this point Foo Fighters who basically double this band in terms of age know more about rocking and rolling than these guys do and don't sit down because I've moved your chair hi audience Ong when it came out over at the website and honestly the more I listened to that tune since I I reviewed it the more tired of it I become at first I was pretty impressed by the volume of the riffs and the song in general it does kind of sound like working with Josh ohm home haami on their last record did kind of have a lasting effect on the band all the words have just formed around these very terrible concepts dealing with taking a risk doing something dangerous like breaking a mirror or rolling the dice or writing a song titled don't sit down because I've moved your chair I mean lyrically some of these songs are too corny for their own good let's be honest here let's be honest with ourselves now outside of those songs my two least favorite on the album the rest of this LP kind of dabbles in embracing sunshine pop circa 1966 garage rock and very sober safe psychedelic rock with mixed results the track she's thunderstorm starts off the record pretty world I love the way the bass and the drums just build the song up into the first hook which sounds really good and it's just a nice way to get that retro rock sound from a popular British band without having to go listen to that BDI record their other sunny looks back to the past like Hellcat suck it and see reckless serenade all those songs have good hooks but the problem for me is that everything that leads up to the hooks everything that surrounds those hooks is just kind of and then actually a lot of tracks on this LP are like that like the song all my own stunts the hook on there is great memorable and the song kind of falls into it seamlessly but the verses are just all over the place just kind of disjointed and not a very interesting way there if you softer moments on here that go over really well the closer of this LP is good and I like the song Piledriver waltz the verse melody is a cut above the rest on here which is in that hard and I really like the picture Alex Turner paints in the lyrics on this thing with miserable waitress and terrible food and the Heartbreak Hotel it's one of the few semi safe havens on here for lyricism the thing about this album is that there's nothing whatsoever original about it nothing and Arctic Monkeys know that and they embrace that they're cool about that they're fine with it this album is more about reliving a sound than it is creating one and I'm cool with reliving the past Bam Bam but do Arctic Monkeys make me excited thrilled to hear these sounds revived and my answer is just not particularly I just got a handful of good tunes on here a pocketful of change to shake around but nothing that I'm really going to remember by the end of the year to be completely honest so I'm kind of feeling a little strong for to a light five on this thing pretty neutral on it but what do you think of this LP do you love it do you hate it Arctic Monkeys worst Arctic Monkeys best let me know and what should I review next anthony Fantana suck it at sea forever [Music] "},{"id":"IHXn82SEoLY","title":"Ka - The Night's Gambit ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here inter Nets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ha album the Knights gambit this guy's in New York rapper from the Brownsville area who's been flying underneath the radar for a little while now the guy's had his past successes and efforts with natural elements as well as the GZA whose album ProTools he appeared on but he has amassed more buzz than he ever has through his solo stuff especially the album grief pedigree that he dropped last year which had a handful of pretty notable singles on it which had YouTube videos that had tens of thousands of views on them songs like chamber cold facts summer and it songs like this that that sort of paint cod as a very subtle rapper and when I say subtle I mean he really embodies that word in just about every sense then artist possibly can the dude has a really quiet low-key smoky vocal delivery and his flows on his tracks are very slow they're spacious they're hypnotic it's kind of like listening to a sedate MF DOOM and as far as lyrical content cop pretty much delivers a series of stories and bars based around drugs violence the concrete jungle he lives in and other personal experiences and thoughts and last year when I first heard of this guy through singles off of grief pedigree I think I dug his stuff but sort of cast him off as being kind of this quiet rock marciano type another New York MC hookah has collaborated with on a few tracks Rock actually appears on this album and you know part of what sort of had me cold with that comparison is that I didn't really enjoy Rock's latest full-length LP reloaded while I did appreciate the very sort of quiet minimalism that rock went into making that album with it at the end of the day kind of underwhelmed me a little bit and I kind of feel like this album and grief pedigree too to an extent can be a little one-dimensional and thuggish at times but I I seriously think that with the Knights gambit kosm usek has grown past that limitation in a really big way he's making hip-hop music on this album that really breaches into territory that is dark eerie pained tortured song for song for song cause bars on on this LP soundly quietly admitted crimes recorded in a wiretapped sound booth and it's in these lines that he kind of is reflecting upon his past or at least what he projects to be his past and while it doesn't strike me as being regretful in any sense of the word cod does kind of feel like a dude who is very jaded worn and kind of weathered by the very intense experiences he's had across his lifetime he kind of seems like a guy who for a long time has always had to be on guard and has also had to navigate through some really tough situations which is an issue on this LP that is reflected with all the wordplay and symbolism having to do with chess on this album also the album cover the album title and there are numerous vocal edits and snippets played throughout this album that referenced the game of chess as well a play chess but my past is checkered a lot of what cast says on this album to tell you the truth is is very thoughtful and thought-provoking he's not really a guy despite the fact that there are elements of violence there are elements of of many other things that are mentioned in hip-hop music in his music he's not a guy for empty boasts or or shallow material pursuits now as far as the instrumentals on this LP something that that also kind of hooked me in on this album and made me really interested in where Kyle was going with his music the beats on this thing are not hooky they're not loud just like Cobb but still to me they registers being very creative refreshing and kind of bold for hip-hop music just because of this kind of quiet and creepy aesthetic that they go for like the opening track on this LP which has all these primal tom drums playing throughout and a guitar riff that I actually think comes from Black Sabbath's self-titled track Black Sabbath if it wasn't ripped from that song it's a guitar riff that sounds exactly like that song and like Black Sabbath's Black Sabbath this track is is similarly dark the song our Father has this really tense chord progression to it and I just love the pacing of the drums and the keys on this track did it and then you get this wide gap of space and then they just like kind of come in and interject quickly and then again you get this wide gap of space it's a really interesting thing about this LP that there are very few hip-hop albums that that like this one I think use space as creatively to create tension to create unease and this track is rife with that sentiment with the sort of hollow wood percussion kind of clicking away in the background and the lyrical topic on this track where essentially Ty's talking about trying to live righteously or just want to be on the side of the good but because of his sort of lifestyle he has to be doing these bad things and he is praying to God asking God to sort of look away as he is going to be doing these dirty deeds in this dichotomy of being kind of caught between the good and the bad side of things is also expressed on other tracks here like bard and likeness but to go on with the instrumentals I love the track jungle with Trillian thei reeling over and over and over against these very softly played lead guitars it's a track whose instrumental is really ethereal it's really cloudy it's like I'm listening back to a hip-hop memory like some kind of flashback and the heavy bass and the hand percussion and the crushing bass II piano notes on the track P sake is fantastic as well and I love the turn of phrase on the hook on this track as well with a pistol being the only piece that coughs ease peace being you know his sort of Avenue toward creating peace or the only kind of solace or safety that he gets but peace also being kind of like a peace I really dig the song knighthood off of this LP with the kind of soulful humming voice that is sampled and looped through the track and even the closing song which has these kind of fuzzy distorted lead guitars it is a track that feels like it could potentially have been a really loud piece of boom bat but instead it goes these sort of soft and subtle route even though Cod does take a lot away from 90s hip-hop his approach feels so new and it's so funny to think of sort of somebody reinventing it in a way that feels this refreshing when you have people out there like Pro era for example who are doing kind of like this 280 re-creation of this older style and and it is enjoyable but to really hear somebody kind of reinvent this style of hip-hop incorporate the personal storytelling it incorporate the gritty kind of Illmatic esque dangerous urban backdrop and to have a rapper who is not really indulging in all of it necessarily not because he wants it to be flash you are impressive or anything like that sort of as a necessity to kind of live when that actually is the case but when that's not the case it really is kind of caught coming off like a reporter but in addition to how awesome the instrumental is on the last track from the cell P off the record the song topic is really awesome too because the track is loaded with bars and in wordplay that are all in reference to classic hip-hop albums from the 80s and 90s if you ever wanted to kind of get like a hip-hop album starter kit or anything like that just watch the music video for this song any group of albums you've managed to pick out of that music video I wholeheartedly endorse now other tracks on here like 30 pieces of silver also a topical track a song that is about betrayal and sort of the the lifestyle that Cobb maybe had been leading at the point where a lot of his songs reflect to earlier in his life and just sort of the dangers of living that lifestyle in respect to not being able to trust others and it's his really quiet stone-faced delivery that that makes this sort of fear feel very real at least for me as I'm listening to this song I honestly think this is one of the most chilling hip-hop songs have heard this year and fantastic topical track on this thing nothing is essentially a song work odd dives into his hip-hop journey a little bit and kind of concludes that if this hip-hop thing is going to work out if this isn't for him then nothing is you know if I have any issues with this album overall I do wish it was a little more diverse and and I would maybe here and there love to hear cos sound a little bit more animated there's always part of me that's going to want a little more diversity but I feel like at least the instrumentals delivered that and even though Cop pretty much does stay at the same sort of quiet semi monotone flow he does bring a diverse array of topics or just really good stories that keep me kind of in the loop and listening very closely as I trip through this album but even though khat is really understated in his flow in his delivery it just cannot be denied that he is a creative and thoughtful emcee and that his delivery style works very well with the amount of wordplay and his effort he puts into every single word that he writes out every single bar that he measures this is just kind of his style it's not going to be for everybody and you know dive in deep into bars and sort of thinking about lyrics and being moved by lyricism in general isn't really for everybody but still that doesn't make khat any less good at doing that and that doesn't make this album any less fantastic either I'm actually feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to people who say that I don't review enough hip-hop but the only reason they think that is because they completely overlooked underground MCS like kha and they're not even really on their radar are only the song subscribe and all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana kha forever "},{"id":"cSg87drcKlw","title":"Hop Along - Painted Shut ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone goth in a uto here the Internet's busiest music nerd not at home in a hotel room but still gonna do a review of the new Hopalong record painted shut hopalong is a rock quartet who currently I believe is based out of Philly they've been at it for 10 years now they have a few albums to show for it but even though they have just a little bit of material underground rock fans have had an incredibly passionate response to the music they've released thus far a few years ago the band's full-length LP get dis owned I thought was a little rough around the edges but turned quite a few heads especially thanks to the singing and songwriting abilities of frontwoman Francis score who really stole the show on that record she is she is an incredible vocalist she has this insane rasp to her voice when she's singing especially as she's just reaching up just pushing the volume of her voice it sounds like a saxophone just being played very aggressively or maybe like overdrive distortion but on a vocal level or something like that or maybe even like a cat but even as Francis is reaching up there and really pushing her vocals really busting her vocal cords at the seams she holds an incredible amount of pitch and melody and of course there's a lot of emotion fueling these intense vocal performances too and this vocal talent continues on to this new LP as well painted shut on the instrumental side of things on this LP there is a small but healthy range rock flavors kind of influencing things everything from alternative singer songwriters to indie rock and punk and pop rock if you're a fan of pile or speedy or tease or wax a hat gee I think you're going to get something out of this record not only that but the closing track on here just has such a strong Strokes vibe and the guitar work the very twangy thin guitar work on the song horseshoe crabs reads very much like a modest mouse song so like a lot of artists out there hop along grab ideas from their influences but they execute them tastefully and they are just laying with fantastic vocals fantastic distinct vocals and really good songwriting to the LP is kind of diverse as well diverse enough to make listening to the whole thing enjoyable on the song horseshoe crabs as well this track kind of breaks up the track listing because it's a bit of a piano tune - which is a pretty nice change of pace from the mostly guitar driven tracks and the track listing here there's also the song happy to see me which is an acoustic cut not one of my favorites on here mostly because the acoustic guitar doesn't really sound all that great kind of distorted and flat and very quiet in comparison to the vocals and on top of it I'm not really sure Francis's vocal acrobatics and just bleeding on this track really complements the tone down sound of this instrumental though her performance is passionate and I'm pretty sure I hear harp on this track that was nice for the most part I find myself being drawn toward the very succinct hooky loud blaring just no BS direct more rock-oriented songs than the track listing here and it's not just because they're full of energy or anything like that it's because the songs beneath this rock instrumentation are really catchy and really memorable like on the opener here the not the witness just what Stu taught yeah one of the most unusual topics I've ever heard in a song ever I love the heavy guitars on the chorus here the very harmonious bridge the song waitress has a kind of odd tale to it in the lyrics as well kind of singing about Francis as a waitress having a bit of a weird encounter with somebody and his friends who I think she might have had a past with and she channels that frustration perfectly into a really just instantaneous song with a pretty sticky guitar phrase at the very beginning to the knack this album has for delivering great indie rock tunes with some interesting lyrical quirks continues on two tracks like I saw my twin and Texas funeral and especially within my feet tracks here powerful man which is a bit of a tale of like just kind of for a moment seeing an abusive father hit his kid in public and then going to I guess kind of get him in trouble for it but sort of lacking the details to give inadequate description again some weird tales fueling these songs but it's part of the enjoy ability of the album instrumentally musically I don't really think hopalong is reinventing the wheel all that much maybe on a future record I would love to see some more sonic experimentation or at least some slightly better production though I will give it to them that they did improve things production wise and recording wise on this record over get disowned and you know even if they kind of stay in this lane and continue down the path that they're continuing Francis still sounds like she's going to be a fantastic voice for the band and hopefully her stories continue to be compelling and kind of off the beaten path as well I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh hopalong painted shut forever "},{"id":"ynE0NztYvoc","title":"Iggy and the Stooges- Raw Power Review (Legacy Remaster)","y":5,"x":"piggy and the Stooges raw power legacy remastered crap edition hi my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd doing an album review of this new remastered legacy edition of Iggy and the Stooges raw power this LP was released in 1973 and was the Stooges last album and I do say last album because in my world the weirdness does not exist but whether you realize it or not the Stooges are one of the greatest bands in rock music and this LP is one of their toughest pieces of work if you're fan of punk hard rock or metal raw power is definitely something that you need to be appreciating I know that there are bands that have released you know very hard dark albums before this LP for example the self-titled Black Sabbath album but still raw power is the literal hardening of music a foretelling of the sounds that would be coming out of the punk movement in the late 70s and even by today's standards this LP is seriously seriously ballsy a few bands will go to the lengths that the Stooges did on raw power you want to talk guts they almost disembowel themselves on every track the problem the issue with this album is that it has suffered numerous numerous mixing problems it's like it's like raw powers almost cursed like it's just destined to spend the rest of eternity wallowing in various forms of crappy sounds originally the album was recorded and produced my Stooges frontman Iggy Pop but after hearing it the label legacy forced a remix sent David Bowie in there to do damage control but the thing is it doesn't matter how great of a producer you are David Bowie only had one day to mix it and that was kind of a well documented now of course the limited mixing time resulted in a garbage sound that did the band no justice and led to very poor album sales for raw power the Stooges previous album sounded much better but still the ideas the concepts the raw driving energy of this album was still there and of course that gain that the cult following that would make it influence music for years to come now eventually raw power was re-released on CD in the 80s and like most CD releases that came out in the 80s the resulting sound was not pretty in 97 Legacy looked into remix in the album inviting Iggy Pop to do the remix telling him that whether he was in on the project or not this remix was going to happen so he might as well take part in it and the result of that 97 remix is quite possibly one of the loudest most assaulting albums in rock music this thing is freaking punishing after Iggy Pop put it together the 97 version is unbelievably compressed I had no clue they could put that much compression on music in the 90s with the amount of bleed the compression gives to this remix of the album it's almost as if he pop ran each individual instrument through a grinder and then mix them all together and then put it in you know some intestines it's basically like musical sausage one instruments just bleeding into the other instrument it's kind of hard to pull apart but when it's all together which is just you know how it should be it's such a mind and a lot of people got down on that 97 remix there's some really clear distortion and even Stooges members James Williamson and Ron Ashton had come out publicly saying yeah we like the Bowie mix better but if we look at a little side release that came out in 95 titled rough power this LP is a set of the original pre Bowie mixes of raw power and the thing is the thick bassy sound of the new Iggy Pop mix is totally there it's a little messier than Bowie's mix in terms of production and editing and just the the sound of the in there's a little bit of his a little bit of noise and some of the tracks but still I have to respect this 97 mix because to me it seems like that was what was originally intended for the album to sound like if you look at the original mixes on that rough power that remix may not be perfect but there's a lot more balance in the instruments it's a lot less treble II and to me a lot more of an assault and a better representation of what the Stooges wanted to be or were supposed to be this new Legacy Edition like I said is just a rerelease of the original Bowie mixes with a bit of remastering and that has made the song sound much more pleasurable I guess you could say but still the flaws and the bad mixing are still there the bass and the drums are pretty much gone for me the first three tracks on this album with the Bowie mix completely ruined searchin destroys one of the most badass opening tracks of all time and one of the most badass rock songs of all time but this version got just no drums no bass the leads are three times louder than anything else going on in the song to the point where it's painful to listen to the drums kick up a little bit more on the track penetration but not by much in fact throughout this entire Bowie mix the drums never really get the attention or the respect that they deserve pretty much the entire time Iggy's vocals and the lead guitar take turns being too loud to tolerate I realize the historical significance of putting out this album and maybe not letting the Bowie mixes completely go into obscurity to the point where people can't get a hold of them but still because this thing is getting reissued I'm more concerned about it creating buzz creating some questions about who the Stooges are I know there are a lot of younger viewers in my audience and a more worried about them getting introduced to the Stooges properly because there's such a great band and the thing is if as a result of this reissue coming out you're kind of wondering you're hearing about them you don't know who they are you're wondering if you should pick up this LP I highly advocate checking out the Stooges but still I recommend he's 97 remix much more this new kind of deluxe reissue there are some cool live recordings on this release too but it seems to me like it's more of a piece of history as opposed to some kind of remastered remixed reissue definitive edition that everyone can go to to get the real badass intended feel of what raw power is for me even though it's not perfect that badass version is still the 97 Iggy remix this thing it is just kind of something that you may pick up if you're curious as to what the Bowie mixes were if you're really obsessed with the Stooges and you're kind of a collector of things that are related to the band or if you're one of those people and I know that there are quite a few of you who really do hate that Iggy mix of course no matter what makes you're listening to the greatness of all the songs on raw power is going to shine through the Rhine tensity the energy just the overall feel is going to shine through today just like it did in 1973 however I feel like it's easier to get this album when you either listen to the rough power version or the 97 Iggy remix not the Bowie mix so raw power the concept the idea the songs to me get a mofo 10 they get a mofo 10 okay but the thing is this version this Bowie mix and this reissue is kind of a light five for me obviously all my clones are with the mixing and whether or not I feel like the sound of that is representational of the band I don't happen to think that this version is grab the Iggy version grab that rough power version they're pretty cheap on the internet and do get into Iggy and the Stooges one of the best bands in rock and roll and one of the reasons rock music is as hard as it is today Anthony Fantana again the Stooges raw power you "},{"id":"o6bkUlYcLD8","title":"Foxygen - We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Fox Egan we are the 21st century masters ambassadors of peace and magic Fox Egan is the singing songwriting duo multi-instrumentalist duo of Jonathan Rado and Sam France I fell in love with them or their music rather last year when I heard the reissue of this take the kids off Broadway which I guess at the time I thought was an EP I put it on my favorite EPS list of last year but I guess this is their new album but it's about as long as this EP it's kind of confusing and my love of this had me psyched to listen to this mostly because of this is very spontaneous mix of influences coming from a whole slew of artists who made great music during the 60s and 70s Eric Burdon and the animals David Bowie the kinks Rolling Stones Lou Reed and and many more fox Jin would just bunny hop from one sound to another with like no warning whatsoever but still come out in the end with some really great in kind of cohesive and ambitious songs that had a really interesting song structure or arc to them now as far as 21st century goes this album still sees Fox again being a very kind of nostalgic project with flashes of inspiration coming from the previously mentioned artists as well as guys like Dylan on this LP or Phil Spector maybe even a little bit of rockabilly but I feel like this time around Jonathan and France are kind of subtracting the spontaneity and not really jumping around as ferociously as they used to the songs on this LP no longer sound like three different artists alternating on a single song to me the songs on this new LP are much more about focus cohesion and really kind of fleshing out a single idea instead of developing some sort of crafty detour which is certainly a risk I mean having the whole detour thing there is really fun it's kind of distracting but I will say that in this new version of oxigen songwriting style they have seen success they've pretty much on on this LP brought a mixed bag of some very nicely written tracks that are a lot of fun and have kind of a vintage veneer to them I guess outside of that I'm not really seeing any sort of huge theme or arc or concept all these tracks together but that's not necessarily a bad thing I do think they work together relatively well it just doesn't really I guess have that gigantic punch that I would want from an album in general but still I feel like 21st Century Fox engine is still making LPS that are a little too short to maybe kind of bring that impact still there are many many highlights on this thing track for track for track like the song no destruction which has a really smoky saloon worthy kind of folk rock flavor to it I love the production on this track and much of the album and has a strong 60s vibe to it it's really vintage just like their last project but is way more clear than take the kids off Broadway I love the Lazy kind of apathetic vocals on the verses on this track they are kind of pain somewhat ambivalent too they sort of go crazy a little nutty they act out very I guess flamboyantly as they're singing about smoking pot in the subway and I love the way the pace kind of picks up on the chorus I mean if there's one thing that Fox agem is just consistent about with every single one of these tracks they bring a nice contrast between the verses and the chorus is the course is all speed up they burst they grow they just really flower blossom it's a really swanky jam and I love the ending on this track to oxygen rights a lot of tight endings for these songs as well this one in particular has some nice harmonica the song on Blue Mountain the way the song continually kind of picks up speed as it goes along it feels like racing up a mountain there's just more sound and detail as we go up the bass line kind of locks in with a kick drum which is attached to a beat that is very snappy I love the falsetto background vocals I need it I need it and the way the chorus kind of crashes in with all these Panos and and cymbals moving in those Suns I love the freakin melody on this damn chords as well as many others on here in the with song suddenly slows down as it goes back into the verse and then kicks back in toward the ending getting more intense kind of psychedelic it's a good track the song San Francisco I mean two words love ly impossible not to sing along with this freaking chorus I was born in Maui and what is that pretty punky sound on this song is that a glockenspiel there's just some really pretty chords on this song and the way the melody on the intro sort of bounces around flutters about like a butterfly but in the piano especially before the course with the chords that is being played there's kind of a sinister undertone to this song as well as many other songs on here mostly I feel through the kind of weird somewhat absurd ously ryx sometimes I pick up some themes of religion sometimes I pick up some themes of war the song Shuggie another extremely infectious chorus and I love the intro melody there are some keyboards on this track that feel like a Mellotron a woodwind as well and the title track on here is extremely rowdy I think kind of hilarious with the title of the song being kind of repeated over and over and over and over in a way that I mean it's so long it's kind of impossible to be catchy so it's sort of repeated or vocalizing this kind of wacky zany aggressive pop kind of way which is kind of a surprise because when the vocals on the Selphy do get aggressive they usually resemble much more of a I guess sort of Mick Jagger kind of thing but the song just gets kind of more speedy and more ruthless as it moves on and the final track here oh no - which to me is is a great closer has kind of this Space Oddity sort of vibe to it and these William Shatner likes spoken word interjections that I like quite a bit in the closing piano ballad on this track is stellar as well I mean really the unicorns influence pours out on this track specifically like a guy like Alden Penner I see him having a lot of influence on what Sam and Jonathan do the only songs on here I really kind of fault are the short just one minute track that has kind of a rockabilly thing going on I like but I wish it was longer the intro track on here that I liked I liked how it exploded with the huge background vocals they had a lot of reverb on him but I wish it was longer and the song oh yeah had a really great chorus to it but to me the verses just had way too many kind of I guess sort of rock cliches yeah there are quite a few of them on this album but that one just had too many to handle and some really weak lyrics too again my only main issues with this LP is that I wish it was longer and I wish the songs connected I guess in a more obvious or strongly conceptual way I mean really that's it I think Fox's j'en is on a really good progression with this album focusing more on that songwriting then those detours as I've already said with a lot of great choruses melodies stellar production and a vintage flavor but still they've maintained enough kind of eccentricity enough strangeness to feel modern new and kind of weirdly fresh I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think love it hate it why what should I review next and that's it Anthony Fantana boxes in forever [Music] you "},{"id":"U_PyyvgFLLI","title":"Justice - Woman ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone I would say all 'funny right a no but I'm afraid of someone actually thinking I'm a member of the alright here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new justice album woman French electronic music duo justice they are back with a new record and they are a duo whoo God I was anticipating this record mostly because I love their debut album cross that came out back in 2007 so much sure it has its flaws but I think that album is such a fantastic moment for dance music in the 2000s really a high point in a lot of ways that is an epic record that record has a lot of presence to it it has I don't know it's almost like a religious experience that's why the cross is so goddamn fitting I will do the D ance and the the altar of beats I love this album which is why it hurts so much to hear justice shortchange themselves again on another new album it's been five years since the release of their last record audio Video Disco which was not an album you wanted to let have like some breathing room afterwards because the longer that album just kind of sat out there in the open the longer we just sort of had it sink into our heads that man that that was really let down for numerous reasons I mean not only was the album an unenjoyable change of pace seeing just as sort of incorporating more live instrumentation but sort of failing pathetically to actually drum up a groove that made me want to dance there are a couple cool songs on this thing here and there and in a way it was cool to see justice pay tribute directly to the styles of disco and funk music that they pulled inspiration from on their debut record and I would be lying or at least omitting the truth if I didn't come out and say that in a way woman is certainly an improvement on what justice was attempting to do on audio video disco it at least sounds like there's more live bass lines and drums on this record and maybe as well I'm not entirely sure what's live in what sequence it blends together really well and I think that's what makes the mix of what makes the production of this album slightly better it doesn't sound clunky or stiff it doesn't sound like justices in the middle of a transitional moment they effectively blended these worlds of electronic and analog really well the problem though is that the compositions on this record are so painfully uninspired again justice comes through with a dance record that doesn't make me want to dance at all maybe it would elicit some light head bobbing during like a headphone listening session but that's it the beats on this thing are so flaccid they're so watered down you get a good groove here and there and some of the instrumentals are okay but justice was so much more than a decent instrumental duo back when they originally drop and broke the scene and made everybody want to make electro house this is not that huge epic  bowling ball dropped into a kiddie pool experience that cross was could they still demand that same sort of level of social relevance probably not but at least produce a track that could give me a glimmer of hope that that might be possible in 2016 because they're not even doing that not only do the the beats on this thing the dance grooves barely even I think put a dent in my desire to move my body but the vocal performance is on this thing are horrendous who is singing on this record the singing is so boring and forgettable it might as well not even be there I just feel like I'm listening to all of these half-hearted disco rock songs and a couple of the tracks are oddly experimental and feature these kind of noisy very dissonant and chaotic guitar solos that I don't really think compliment justices sound or vibe at all oh that song love SOS is a total mess it's a love love emergency their tracks on this thing that sound like aerial pink and Toro y Moi collaborating to purposefully create the most bland disco that they could imagine it sort of has that throwback nostalgia quality to it that so many disco inspired albums do but justice don't really make me excited to hear disco music or make me desire that eras return rather they just kind of remind me of why disco eventually fell and why that was a good thing I'm just not really sure what else to say about this record other than that it's just another disappointment from justice again in comparison with their last record there are some slight very slight improvements but I feel like those production and those instrumental improvements are kind of squashed by the fact that this is justices weakest crop of songs to date sure it's like pleasant to listen to like you could have it on in the background but it's not like this experience which again is what was so fantastic about justice to begin with they made dance music that felt like something more than just dance music it was like connecting with dance music on a spiritual level it was like dance music as a religion but even though with this latest record over here we are treated to another cross on the cover the further justice progresses into their discography the more they feel like I don't know not religious dance music producers but more like dance music secularists or agnostics or dance music atheists I don't know I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the

Care, Take Care, Take Care ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"he's like that big of a shock it's like every album that's been really hyped or really popular since like November just hasn't like lived up to the the hype behind it I guess for me but okay just not it's not huge not amazing no no I like that Beastie Boys album yesterday implying what that they're cool well they are haters gonna hate hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's I hate the Internet it's time for an album review of the new explosions in the sky LP take care take care take care these guys are a Texas instrumental rock outfit it's been four years since they've followed up their last LP all of a sudden I miss everyone no ep's no singles no phone calls and I would be lying if I didn't say I didn't that this waiting period was going to result in some kind of great realization or change for the band and I've been listening to this LP on and off since I got the promo version of it and I'm just visiting it and revisiting it and waiting for the moment where it just clicks with me and makes my brain happy because right now I feel like I'm in a coma I'm in a weird alternate dreamworld where I don't love the new explosions in the sky LP and I just want to wake up from this horrible nightmare but I do feel like my enjoyment or lack thereof of this album has been horribly horribly mutilated by my love of this group's past work to me explosions sound improved greatly from tell the truth - all of a sudden those early albums do have a lot of beauty to them but you know in retrospect they are kind of just a little bit rough around the edges and now that the band's sound is huge they have achieved epic where do you go from there where do you go from there when your sound is so dependent upon this loud soft dynamic explosions in the sky is kind of sticking to their guns on this record much of what is on this LP sounds exactly like what is on their last LP the guitar still shimmer the same way the drums are still really loud the snare sound like pistols are going off the bass drums sound like bombs are blowing up in the distance but there are a few instrumental additions to this album that are put on here to kind of give the the appearance of evolution and progression in terms of style noticing some acoustic guitar on here that I like don't know why the band wasn't using it more on their past couple LPS also noting some string work as well so subtle that you wouldn't even really notice it unless you were listening really really hard just really paying attention to the music leaning over in your seat and engaging with it but there are some things on here I don't care for at all like the loop percussion some of what I think sounds like hand percussion on some of these tracks that I really don't care for also the wordless vocals not that I prefer them to have words but these really spectral moans and the humming these hums just don't really add much to the tracks for me I guess my problem is that I don't really love not one single track on this album from beginning to end but I do find myself gravitating towards certain spots in these songs though the middle of be comfortable kind of underwhelmed me but I love the descending guitar melody over that part of the song and the really droney guitar outro on that is nice too great sounds and i love the twinkling intro on postcard before the primal drums come in and just start thumping really hard and kind of ruining what could have been a very delicate moment hello that first explosion of guitars after the band stops playing with that hip hop beat not say the band has never done stuff like that before I'm the track let me back in but I still can't say I'm enjoying this album as a whole though and I know a lot of you guys are and that's fine I'm still just kind of mixed though I know that the feelings on this album are nowhere near as depressing or desolate on all of a sudden I miss everyone but I can't help but feel like in a way I've kind of gotten the same record over again because when it comes to how these guys build their songs they're still doing it in a really predictable way I'm talking about the way these guys layer their tracks when they introduce new melodies how long they lay on climax how long until that climax actually gets here so I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this album it was alright but how do you feel about this record are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana explosions in the sky take care take care take care further yeah wear shorts black socks or what so what "},{"id":"c_A7jwZypEQ","title":"J. Cole - 4 Your Eyez Only ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new J Cole album for your eyes only North Carolina rapper dreamville figurehead a lot of people see him as sort of a bit of a jay-z protege as well but then maybe not right now at one point for sure but not now he is coming up to bat on this thing for his fourth full-length commercial album following up 2014's 2014 Forest Hills Drive which went double platinum with no features as the meme goes and with this new record over here I feel like I'm getting a bit of deja vu with Cole's last record once again he is dropping an album very late in the year he also teased toward this album like he did his last one with a pretty aggressive cut where he goes at other rappers I like the track a lot but it's kind of disappointing that the song didn't make it onto this record though but in retrospect after listening to this thing I I get why that song wouldn't have really fit into the narrative of this album I guess other parallels between this record and Cole's last album is that they are similarly low-key lots of very smooth jazzy instrumentals on this thing which are also paired with a handful of very nocturnal very Spacey track bangers to the beats are Pleasant but none of them really come off as all that urgent and the same kind of goes for Cole's very laid-back rapping and and moody singing which occasionally is is kind of off-key like what is it on that song vile mentality that the singing at the start of that track is terrible hmm sonically it's nothing groundbreaking for Jay Cole or for hip-hop in general but I do think some of the jazzy instrumentation and string sections that are paired with tracks like For Whom the Bell Tolls and she's mine are actually pretty gorgeous but the power of this album doesn't really lie in the instrumentals but the story the narrative of the album although I think the tale Cole spends on this record could have been told a little more cohesively basically on this album you have a young Jay Cole you have a friend of his from back in the day who died young dealing drugs which person Cole is rapping from the perspective of isn't always 100% clear but the most obvious part of this story is Cole's friend's daughter who is now fatherless Cole is essentially trying to tell her father story to her through this album he says as much on the final track where he goes into an incredible amount of detail the detail that in my opinion many of the previous tracks really lacked a lot of the songs before the closer he read more like vignettes and the title track is kind of like an epilogue that explains why all of these songs sort of makes sense on the same album but it's kind of strange that j cole would couch this whole album underneath the title track this story about his friend that he's trying to tell to his friend's daughter when a bulk of this album is just about jay Cole as much as I like a song like neighbors that track doesn't really seem to fit into this conversation that he's trying to have with her and there are other spots on this record where Cole goes into his own experiences with love and making bad decisions as a young man and also fatherhood specifically on the song she's mine Part two which in my opinion is the most touching moment on the record I appreciate the sentiment of this album as a whole on what is trying to say the point is trying to make but again I think it could have been told in a more compelling cohesive and logically flowing fashion and also with less filler lyrics like the intro track for Whom the Bell Tolls we have refrains on here where Cole is rapping about as whatever in his eyes and it should come as no surprise such an obvious rhyme such a filler lyric why should it come as no surprise it that makes no sense it adds nothing to what you're static that's just a placeholder bar still though the track does a decent job of setting the moody tone of the album and and sort of the dark tortured mentality of the fledgling drug dealer that Cole portrays on the next track immortal which features these gritty lyrics and these simple spacious trap rhythms and reverse melodies that are kind of hypnotic but immediately after on this track we have more filler lyrics kicking off the song deja vu put a finger in the sky if you want it put two fingers in the sky if you want it and so on and so forth does this mean anything but probably not and what this refrain has to do with the love song that transpires after it I don't know and course because it is a love song ended his coal there has to be a handful of like sort of cringy bars worked into the track but at this point on the album coal starts developing a story we have boy meets girl then he starts sort of revealing himself on the song vile mentality and telling her about himself and sort of revealing his vulnerabilities then the deepening of their relationship on the song she's mine part one which of course head games stronger than two excedrin I wanted to shut the album off still though I think the way that Cole is bearing himself to his lover on these tracks is sort of admirable and I like that we are getting some kind of story here that's building momentum but then it all sort of changes pace on the song change which I do think is one of the better cuts on the record but it doesn't really add anything to the story that's been building up for the past three tracks here again we get kind of a bird's eye view of the the drug game that Cole was rapping about on the song immortal and he sort of gives his thoughts on not only the vicious cycle that a lot of people might find themselves in if they enter into that world but also the prison system religion he's speaking on all of these obstacles and in Justices within the system but he puts responsibility for change on the individual talking about on the hook that you might expect change at the pen glide meaning that you might expect some rapper or someone like me to just write or spit a lyric that all of a sudden will just change things but that's not how it works change real change comes on an individual level it comes from within you I like the track a lot I think it's one of Cole's best tracks and it's really insightful smart and tasteful piece of jazz rap and again I like the really dark and moody song neighbors which is essentially about racism and stereotypes talking about Cole moving out of his old neighborhood into a predominantly or I guess a presumably white upper-class neighborhood where his neighbors think he's selling drugs so they call the cops on him which brings us to the song fold and clothes really the the worst track on the record not just because of the obvious statements and filler lyrics where Cole is rapping about wanting to do the right thing so much better than the wrong thing we know that we know that the right thing is is better than the wrong thing that's that's like saying the sky is blue really on this track Cole is making a mountain out of a molehill nobody's gonna give you a medal for doing the laundry dude and also your rapping about your girlfriend having a lot on her plate and having a lot to do but she's just sleeping on the couch they're not to say that she shouldn't be everybody deserves a nap but you know it just seems like an obvious contradiction to the story that you're telling and I do the laundry at my house when I do I don't got to write a fucking song about it it's just hilarious that Cole brings up doing the laundry after saying he feels like the best version of himself like whoa the the greatest version of me folds clothes like this is really you at your best watching Netflix hanging out on the couch rhyming almond milk with almond milk this is just regular life for a millions of Americans in 2016 this is not an act of heroism I get that the song is about the simple things in a way sure but Cole goes about portraying them in such a corny fashion that it's just such a skippable track and that's pretty much the album even though it's over 40 minutes it feels criminally short for the issues for the the pieces of story the pieces of narrative that Cole is trying to develop here the execution is just way off because I think for what Cole was trying to build and accomplish here there are just too few moments directly and laser focus on the life of Cole's friend on Cole's friend's daughter on communicating these messages to her on young Cole's life the only reason this album makes a lick of sense is that the closing track sort of wraps it all up and explains hey here's here's at what this album is actually about guys despite all this I do think this album is one of Cole's better projects it's just kind of a mess really Cole has a lot of loose ends that really needed to be tied up and they just aren't I feel like he wanted to or at least he was implying as if he was going to bring the listener on some kind of journey into his life or his friend's life or into his past but instead we got like a few weird scrawled diary entries that are barely legible and a weird track about folding clothes I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best or should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry all sorts of links next

REVIEW","y":6,"x":"symphony concerto here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching and it's time it's time for a review of the new shellac record dude incredible this is the latest full-length LP from famed underground rock outfit shellac they have been releasing albums pretty steadily since the mid 90s for example their debut LP at action Park a pretty significant record in the noise rock post hardcore math rock canon but a great deal of shellac reputation is built upon that of one of its members Steve Albini of course we cannot downplay the input from other members such as Todd Trainor and Bob Weston Bob you might also remember him from doing tape loops and sound effects for Mission of Burma but Steve is a super producer engineer studio owner he's worked with everyone from Slynt to the Pixies Nirvana Don cab the Jesus Lizard screaming females Cloud Nothings and despite my love of his other projects like big black sometimes Steve's reputation as a producer and an engineer overshadows his influence as an artist regardless that is what we are going to focus on here with this new LP dude incredible is an album of music that is as clearly and as boldly stated as the title that represents it this thing is nine tracks 33 minutes we have guitars drums various members of the band trading off on vocal duties there are loads of very crunchy sharp distorted guitars and bass guitar on this thing sometimes the guitars can get kind of shrill or so distorted that the sound is just like destructive it's on fire it's crumbling shellac continues on this new record to offer pummeling grooves and riffs that often times are in a really weird time signature on this new record shellac continues to offer pummeling riffs some of which ride some some off-kilter grooves a lot of these riffs or guitar leads are repeated to help bring tension up as the song progresses the vocals feature some yelling some screaming some kind of raw spoken word a little bit of amateurish singing and the production as usual is pretty clear it's pretty crisp the drums are really boomy the guitars and the bass are really close and up in your face I think the vocals are a little muffled unfortunately on this record when comparing them to previous shellac efforts especially at action Park and a thousand Hertz but still on this new LP like on previous releases the are usually pretty stark and no BS one of my favorite tracks from 1000 Hertz you'll hear a lyric like this is such a sad  song we'll be lucky if I don't break out crying all of these characteristics I just mentioned you can find running pretty continually through the entire shellac discography shellac sticks to its self applied minimalist tag as well there aren't that many overdubs or layers on this record the distortion isn't usually so heavy that it takes away from the dynamics of the guitars everything here is pretty free of reverb the the recording overall just very dry it's very clear that shellac pulls a lot from bands like Mission of Burma or have a great appreciation for the music of Fugazi or take a great deal of influence from bands like wire and I guess it's cool to see that these influences still have a place on the band's newest records it's also another instance of the incredibly raw and dynamic performances that usually find themselves on a shellac record - there is a lot of interplay on this record record record record Steve Bob and Todd are just together in a way that you don't really hear a lot of bands together in studio recordings these days whether it be in commercial radio music or even in the underground because it's easier to record stuff digitally and just kind of multitrack stuff now and this comes out right from the start of this LP with the opening track that features a guitar riff that feels like it's pulled right out of a stoner rock song but they groove it out in a totally different way once the bass and the drums come in this is a six minute long track there's numerous parts to it a few surprise changes I owe that hook that I can't totally make out the lyrics mostly because the vocals do feel kind of muffled in comparison of vocals on previous records like I mentioned earlier but still the hand and the hand are there the energy the electricity behind this part in the song is just crushing there are a few likeable angular left-field rock songs on this record like the very dreary track Gary or even the incredibly funny at the very end I'm riding bikes but most of the tracks here feel more like abstract experiments in rock art and that's totally fine that's why I enjoy wire albums like 154 or why I enjoy earlier shellac records this results in moments like all the surveyors we're in the middle of the track with these pummeling raw guitarists you're getting these calls of kah kah kah song surveyor is great too this album has quite an obsession with surveyors although I wish that obsession led to a good track on the mayor / the surveyor which is kind of a one minute instrumental where the guitarist is so horrendously half-baked it just kind of leads me to think did you write this did you write anything or did you just figure you were gonna wing it while I do like relaxed performances and their energy and their aesthetic I guess you can't really go into this LP expecting a catchy straightforward or even an entirely visceral rock album because there are some I guess anti songs on here tracks like you came in me or the people's microphone hard-hitting tracks but they're also kind of daunting and challenging to you know you're going to need patience for these songs I suppose although these tracks - a lot like mayor surveyor do feel a tad under in as well overall I would say this is a pretty good LP there are some underwhelming tracks there are some great tracks the entire album itself is kind of short and given that shellac really hasn't made any effort toward reinventing themselves on this LP it does have a lot of similarities with their past catalogue although in a lot of ways they are doing what they have always done as well as they have always done it I'm glad bands like this are still kicking if you're a die-hard experimental rock fan I would say give this record to listen and especially check out their back catalogue if you haven't already I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana shellac dude incredible forever "},{"id":"CCJZO4I2SS8","title":"Lil Yachty - Lil Boat 2 ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"uh hi everyone - II win tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little yadi mixtape a little boat - little yachty is a Georgia rapper who's been making waves and rap game for the past couple of years now really ever since he started dropping some preliminary singles that ended up going viral from his original little boat mixtape which I liked quite a bit which people still give me a hard time to this day for liking this mixtape I enjoy this mixtape okay let me let me live what made this mixtape special for me is that it was packed with this really sunny carefree trap with very goofy but kind of unique rapping from the king of teens himself I love the really euphoric in unorthodox production on this thing and the way it melded with a lot of yachties auto-tune vocals and some of his other weird vocal inflections and ad-libs also I love the weird double persona duality thing going on with this project the yachty boat double sided identity I mean sure yadi is not the most skilled rapper in hip-hop and he is far from the greatest lyricist the game has ever seen but there were a lot of weird eccentric and unique qualities and characteristics about this tape that just made it kind of irresistible for me despite some really obvious flaws for me yadi was coming off as one of the true eccentrics in this new wave of whatever you want to call it soundcloud rappers otto crooners mumble rappers my worry though coming away from this project is that little boat was essentially going to be a flash in the pan it was going to be a fluke and it seemed like that was going to end up being the case because the following mixtapes summer songs - was kind of hurried didn't really have as many fantastic tracks on it although I didn't really put too much stock in that mixtape didn't really shake me when I saw that I ended up being kind of indifferent toward it but yadi fell off hard with his commercial debut album teenage emotions it seemed like he might might maybe come through on this thing but this is easily one of the most over bloated and just overdone commercial rap records of the decade it felt like everything that made yachty great originally but just watered down to the point where it lost its appeal not only that but there were just way too many tracks on this thing way too many tracks just really plain songs expensive production and all of the really uniquely weird qualities that made the little yachty special previously we're just stripped out of his sound and with all of this corporate oversight going into the album he still managed to drop a bar where he mixed up a cello with a clarinet thankfully though little boat two is pretty much a return to form for me nothing on here sounds like it's trying too hard to be a hit or trying too hard to be serious in comparison with the original little boat tape there is a similar balance of bangers and ballads on this thing being delivered in this really raw off-the-cuff fashion with a healthy dose of youthful exuberance the major difference though with little boat 2 and its predecessor is that there is a huge influx of these really dark minimal Spacey trap Tunes that didn't really play too much into the vibe of the last little boat tape maybe yah Dee's feeling kind of dark on this record feeling kind of Moody a direction I don't really mind in concept although it does seem like little yachty has kind of abandoned the formal separation between the yachty and boat personalities maybe it's still here in spirit because yadi hasn't totally abandoned the sound from the original little boat tape but the formality of the intro on that tape along with some of the theatrics in between songs we're part of what made that project and yachties special by comparison on little boat to the song self made is such an uneventful opener I mean it might say a lot about how little yachty perceives has come up in the rap game but it's not really much of an introduction to yachty as an artist so little boat 2 isn't quite as thematic it's not quite as well groomed and tightly sequenced as its predecessor at the end of the day it just kind of feels like a collection a compilation of tracks but it's still actually not a bad listen this thing is a pretty decent collection of very fiery low-key bangers total irradiating this base energy with production that is consistently dark and kind of quirky and yes while it's not deep it's it's not trying to be deep it's just it's just fun it's just fun there were a lot of highlights in the tracklist for me here love the song boom with ugly god I love the cavernous hypnotic trap instrumental on this thing the deep reverb the very subtle but very hype ad-libs the line about somebody taking one of yachties chains and then all the years boom ugly gods feature is actually not that bad he changes up his flow a little bit and even dips into an auto-tuned passage is kind of a chameleon here the song oops is really strange bassy and mega skeletal super minimal like everything you need nothing you don't just a little bit of percussion here a little bit of bass there's like a lot of space in this B and yadi kicks the song off with with a pretty decent triplet flow I do not get why people constantly rag on him for not being able to rap dude can clearly rap there's some decent chemistry going on between him and 2 Chainz and K supreme on the track like they definitely complement each other on the song the song count me in goes much harder instrumentally is hilariously boastful that one line on here about him stacking shit call him Adi Rothschild there's tons of overblown bass on this thing and these reversed hypnotic arpeggios that are really trippy the songs she ready with P and B rock sounds like a Airy pretty track ballad that could have been on the original little boat tape but a little bit sleeker a little bit more commercial a bit catchy er definitely one of the better PNB features that I've heard since I caught with of the dude I love the woodwind keys and and leads as well meanwhile the song das cap is cold it's murderous it's frightening I love the yachty line on this track about copying an island and putting himself on the map yadi continues to bring the viscera and the energy and the excitement and the hype with tracks like pop out huh which is loaded with these shouty refrains and just totally freaky ad-libs like that like they're not even thinking about what the ad-lib is gonna be anywhere they're just like oh oh like I just love the funky energy behind these tracks I just can't deny it also NBA young boat which is probably one of the only times I will sit through and be a young boy rapping but whatever Silva beat was pretty incredible him and yadi traded it off nicely on the track another killer refrain on the song flex Loki beat flex on the buck boys hey cuz you suck boy baby daddy with a little pump goes over without a hitch the closing track of trippy red is pretty nice too I love the trippy red continues to explore some really weird vocal ideas to me he definitely stands out as one of these Auto crooners I just kind of wonder if he'll ever pull together a super tight super solid taper album in the near future overall little boat - it's not a bad project I like it quite a bit I'm sure I will continue to get shit for enjoying little yachties music but I mean I just fucking do and for me the original appeal of little yachty to begin with has returned on little boat - maybe he's not outdoing himself maybe he's not going above and beyond or getting super ambitious with it but this album for me has a ton of throttle it has a ton of attitude it has a lot of heart he's just kind of throwing out the sporadic creativity and just letting the chips fall where they may there are a few generic and kind of nondescript tracks that I think could have been cut from the project entirely like the song talked to me nice featuring quavo which just sounds like a Mego song without the rest of the migos but it features a little yachty and i'm just so tired of their sound at this point they just oversaturated things in my opinion while I enjoyed the more low-key direction that yadi took this project and I feel like generally he overloaded little boat - with a bit too much of that it's it's kind of bloated a little bloated meanwhile songs like love me forever which was a very nice Airy euphoric ballad is is just a minute

REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone and chubby fish tuna here the Internet's fishiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cool coat code orange record I am king these guys are at Pennsylvania hardcore and metalcore band this is their sophomore full-length LP they've got a heavy and raw sound they drop their first full-length album back in 2012 on this record they were certainly showing quite a bit of promise really had the whole hardcore world watching with the fact that this album dropped on Death Wish records and they had Curt blue of converge producing I remember crushing riffs on this album type performances good recording some pretty raw vocals but not really much else to me what kind of held this record back was somewhat lackluster writing which in a genre that is typically very fast loud simple and blunt is something that is sort of hard to define or savor but since the inception of hardcore punk and metalcore there have been groups that have run the gamut of creativity bands like converge that are hectic and musically dense the very righteous and wordy and straightforward Minor Threat or groups that are a heavy dark brooding sonic assault like nails and with this new record of there's Code Orange kids essentially sit further on that more dissonant noisy dark and heavy side of hardcore and metalcore right now this record is thrash and bash it does not really have much in the way of finesse nor do I think it wants finesse there are vocals on this record as well not just guitars and drums but I wouldn't really say the vocals come off as having that much to say or communicate the lyrics are pretty unintelligible but vocally there's quite a bit of variation here there are some general hardcore screams just those throat ripping shouts there are some guttural growls metalcore grunts the occasional clean vocal and for whatever reason sometimes muttering yes some of the tracks on here do feature muttering I'm not sure why but they do the vocals on the cell P really are more for sound and emotion and effect than they are a message pretty much Code Orange kids are rather Code Orange now because they have removed the kids sorry they really let their riffs and their production do much of the talking for them together Code Orange and Curt Beaulieu have pulled together and insanely heavy pummeling album the riffs just how thick and how punchy they are along with the drums is just suffocating this record is abusive it's overbearing I really think Curt blue just inches forward into producing his loudest heaviest album yet here so in that regard this record is kind of in advancement it's sort of refreshing but once again code orange is writing is just really nothing to get that excited about or really even remember on track for track book track the band just passes from one indiscernibly sluggish breakdown riff fest to another occasionally devolving into something that sounds like it could have come off of a new metal record in the year 2000 like on the song buying you the intro there or code oranges slow sluggish riff on slots show such little variance that the song just gets stale before it's over like alone in a room even though the the closing track here mercy it is the longest track here it is four minutes but the band does a pretty decent job of keeping it engaging for that duration even though the various parts the band kind of just throws against the wall do feel a little disjointed it don't feature like some really good or creative for fluid segues that bring the song from one part to another the only thing that gives these tracks some significant sonic separation are these tiny trinkets they manage to weave into the heavy riffs like the opener on here which has these just start/stop guitar drones that feel like they could have come out of a horror movie trailer or slow burn which behind the riffs on this track there's this very tinny sharp and very ear grabbing clinging clanking pinging it's very metallic it's very or the song your body is ready which has these very thin dissonant guitar peji O's that kind of bounce back and forth between the riffs the very dissonant shrill guitar chords on my world me me me or the song my world which features the kind of faint distant overly reverb background vocals that I would hear more often in like someone's bedroom shoegaze project versus a hardcore or metalcore album which at the end of the day isn't really that much of a compliment to this albums bone snapping riffs so yeah each track does have a little trick up its sleeve but it's only a small distraction from what is essentially one nonspecific riffey slugfest after another I'm pretty on the fence with most of these tracks there are some songs on here I do like such as I am King and your body is ready as well as unclean spirit but to me these songs are just nice coherent metalcore tracks where the riffs and the momentum seem pretty constant throughout the song the various parts of these tracks either flow into one another or complement one another nicely plus to me these songs don't go so overboard with the breakdowns as other songs do Code Orange despite the name change I've just put out another record that I feel a little on the fence with but maybe I just like slightly at the end of the day even though I think their sound and their performances are very aggressive very intense very massive I think code orange continues to be more hardcore soldiers than they are hardcore superiors I'm feeling a strong v to light six on this LP transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana code orange forever "},{"id":"ImsHI_Z6T2I","title":"The Log.Os- ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"oh boy hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you logos it's the name of this project logos there's not a lot of information to tell about this project all the websites I've found downloads on you know artists affiliated websites just kind of leave the cover art and a liner notes and just the download there and just not much else the production on this LP is handled by Ken Barrientos who has worked with other artists who I have respect for like blue and the law there are two kind of main vocalists on here Nico grey and Omar and Mari there's someone on here handling all the horns there's someone else handling all the strings and a good half a dozen or so guest musicians who range from guitar players to other vocalists this thing is just ten tracks and thirty minutes long and even though this thing is a short and free album I listen to this again and again and again I am like continually surprised at the amount of of just detail effort and quality that has gone into this mini album now what you ultimately get on this logo's album is an electronic futuristic and psychedelic brand of neo soul aided with lots of pianos and horns and strings and the style here is just so fresh sounding it just sounds so new it's the point where it's difficult for me to compare this to anything older really I mean there is kind of a chill vibe going on here with some heavy beats and very smooth relaxing beautiful vocals which which kind of reminds me of of downtempo artists like massive attack but I wouldn't be surprised if these guys spend more time listening to their contemporaries than older stuff there are tons of bee here loaded with odd distorted just bent every which way textures flying and whizzing by in every direction imaginable which reminds me a lot of Flying Lotus and there's also just this jazzy soulful smoothness to these songs to that remind me of of artists like Thundercat who put out that Spacey new-age jazz fusion album the Golden Age of Apocalypse earlier this year also that self-titled debut that subtract dropped to that Sol plus dubstep combination that that worked out really well logos does resemble some of those sounds those artists put out but more than them this project just takes me to higher planes of sonic ecstasy with all these layered vocals and space-age synthesizers it sounds so heavenly seductive sensual mmm I'm kind of pissed it's only 30 minutes long but in the 10 tracks that do make it onto this album there is a lot of variety and with some good highlights the second track which comes after a short intro what a great song to start this album off it just Oh hums it freakin pulsates it throbs with so much emotion it's noisy and it's odd but it's also really beautiful in the the harmonious sense that just kind of get layered into this thing the string arrangements that pop up later into the tune the female vocal that's so echoed is just bouncing off of every every other sound and the in the mix it just feels so relaxing and so classy and with the way the vocals stand out on the 3rd and the 7th track they definitely kind of feel like space soul to me just really poetic lyrics and and beautiful vocal melodies and all this instrumentation rising in the background in a really kind of overwhelming way it kind of felt like to me I was I was floating on my back on a really kind of still body of water under an eye sky like I said not a ton of material on here not a lot of background on this thing so not a whole ton to say other than that I think the music is great and it kind of speaks for itself the songs on this thing all progress it's loaded with creative melodies and textures that that were really mind for really mulled over and and fine-tuned these guys have a really definitive and and memorable style for me and this album really is heavily layered and and it's been growing on me with every listen more lessons reveal more details more sounds more everything more magic overall this LP is just really sending my years to another galaxy now as far as the negatives with this thing go I feel like this is kind of short it does have some tracks that I felt like could have been drawn out a bit more but still I didn't feel ripped off or anything like that and at this point I think logos is still just a little rough around the edges as a project as a collective obviously everyone involved in the group is an experienced musician but the end of this album doesn't exactly tie together all that fantastically and and there are a few tracks on here where I kind of questioned the mixing because I'm hearing the vocals get drowned in the cacophony of everything just a little bit especially on the ninth track where you've got these phaser synthesizers and this kind of like buzzing guitar phrase that gets chopped and looped if you're looking for an album that is free that is chill and when I say chill I mean ice relaxing and fantastically gorgeous and lush this is what you've got to listen to I'm feeling a decent eight on this but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana logos "},{"id":"5pfUULxVoSU","title":"Behemoth - The Satanist ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new behemoth album the Satanist kaljaa chesta you stop that right now this instant making silly growling noises and devil horns is patronizing to metal fans hey the more you know they really do prefer that you go to my knowledge behemoth is the most infamous metal band to come out of Poland they've been active since the early 90s back when their records had a pretty old-school slightly run-of-the-mill black metal sound the songs on these records were pretty low five filled with archaic melodies and even though there was a lot of punch to these albums in this part of behemoths career there was something kind of charming about how the compositions on these records felt centuries old now as the band's recording quality got better with every new LP they started bringing in elements of death metal the band went even further down this road coming together with a string of metal records in the early 2000s that to me were just straight death metal though personally I've never really been a big fan of these albums I do think that at this point in behemoths career the band was sounding really savage and loud but they didn't have much in the way of memorability or finesse but this latest LP the sameness comes five years after the release of behemoths previous album Evangelion which I believe is the largest time gap in between behemoth records which may have something to do with the fact that the band's frontman and guitarist primary songwriter Nergal was actually diagnosed with leukemia and has fought it and recovered since maybe that had something as well to do with the change of pace that behemoth takes on this LP musically the Satanist is easily one of the eiements most ambitious and dynamic records yet and their black metal influences come back in a big way really dark melodies shine through these massive walls of blast beats and tremolo guitars and there's some pretty epic arranged instrumentation added to the mix on this LP as well with horns being the most stunning and exciting a the vocals on this LP are still pretty gruff not a huge change from the band's earlier output if you've been listening to their death metal releases but I do think the singing on this LP is a lot more raw definitely a huge improvement over the more barbaric on records like here and beyond and there's some variety on these tracks to some left hooks here and there like on the track in the absence of light which has this polish spoken word interlude on it with a very distant sax solo hanging in the background there's missing noir we're right at the start of the track I can hear the vocals just cracking with intensity as they're being delivered right at the start of the song on pong then there is the closer which has these really harmonious background vocals just erupting in the background just bringing this song's emotional qualities to just a higher level of intensity it's so beautiful the production on this LP too is fantastic I can't really find a complaint about it the the drums are punchy the guitars are loud but they're not overpowering the vocals as well the guitar tone is is very bright it's burning the bass is a little obscure but when the band is playing riffs it really does seem to to shine out a little bit though bass has never really been a lead instrument in black metal music it's not really a huge loss the metal instrumentation on this record creates a huge wall of sound but there's just enough room left over for just a touch of reverb a little bit of atmosphere and all the additional instrumentation when and if the band decides to use it the brass the strings the organ the chorus vocals and whenever stuff like this pops in it doesn't really ruin the vibe of the song to me it always adds to the very grim and hellish quality of this album for a straight black metal record the songs on this LP are really grand I mean there's nothing on here that is quite as epic or symphonic as let's say an early Emperor record but I like that behemoth was able to find a really satisfying compromise between subtlety and force and the entire album itself actually plays with this dynamic with tracks like fer de vinius as well as ahmen which has one of the most freakish endings on this entire LP with these layered vocals and just such a loud wall of guitars but me personally I mostly prefer the songs on here that have a stronger melodic element like missing noir and there are tracks on this LP too that I think are catchy I mean behemoth really tried to write some strong choruses on a few of these tracks moments on here like the title track and or a pro nobis Lucifer that track has a really sort of unashamed rock guitar solo on here I do like that behemoth is so dark and is so intense on this record but I think bringing in elements of just you know straightforward rock and roll elements of more accessible shades of metal music does sort of show that behemoth does want a visceral response from their listeners as well and I have to mention that I do think there are some very sticky and memorable and enjoyable guitar leads that play throughout these two tracks too I think the Satanist finishes off pretty well too with three very dynamic tracks especially the closer which is one of the best on the entire LP and the longest song - I mean it just feels like such such a final moment on this LP it feels like such an accomplished finish for this record which is a relatively short LP I mean it's just about 45 minutes long it's not really going to overstay its welcome or anything like that my only major issues with this album overall is that the two shorter tracks on here while they are very good songs they do move at such a pace that they were a little bit of a blur on some of my initial listens to this album outside of that I really loved the selfie even lyrics which I think some people may have issues with seeing that they could easily sort of shove them into the corner for being a black metal cliche with all this satanic content however I don't think what behemoth did on this record was write a really tasteless spit in the face toward God and religion I'm not saying this record isn't sacrilegious it is I took the lyrics on this LP as being more allegory more of a narrative more of a character portrait of Satan himself in some instances another thing that I could see people potentially getting down on with this LP is how progressive it isn't this record is definitely not as experimental as some of the really weird black metal fusions that we've been seeing these days with rock and roll progressive rock post rock shoegaze industrial music but I think behemoth does a fantastic job of justifying their more straightforward approach on this blackened death metal record with some very good strong solid memorable writing great sound great vocals very good performances intensity some fantastic drum fills and just a really concise record with a good amount of variety that flows well from beginning to end I think that behemoth really lived up to their name on this record I'm feeling a light night on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana behemoth the Satanist forever "},{"id":"DjLOULyrVZs","title":"The Internet - Ego Death ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new internet record egodeath the Internet is a West coast-based neo-soul outfit affiliated with the now-defunct Odd Future Wolfgang kill them all their debut record was sort of one of the initial kind of run or hype records that a lot of people were just really excited about when Odd Future really came out and said okay we're going to start just dropping albums from our other members and of course the two people affiliated with this project most notably were vocalist Sid the Kid and producer Matt Martians but musically this project really got off to a rocky start as most odd future discographies did on the Internet's debut record not only was their incredibly weak singing and production but some awful songs as well easily some of the worst songs of the year this record dropped like the track cocaine and just when I thought the Internet could not get any more amateur and unlistenable then came their next record feelgood where SIDS vocals continued to feel flat passionless and also on this album the internet did try to take a risk here with a larger instrumental presence not quite feeling so synthetic as the debut album so the internet was bringing on some live instrumentation however this instrumentation a lot of the time was not mixed nor was it performed all that well like the really oddly and just terribly mixed drums on the song the pupil I the patients or the song cloud of our own which kind of sounded like this really jumbled live demo and not only that but the internet also brought on other people to sing not good with them like Mac Miller huh so we have a new internet record here a few changes have been made we actually have a full band here we have a band there is quite a bit of live instrumentation on this new project here and the most important thing is that it's it's mixed kind of good and it sounds like we practiced and the drums and the keyboards and the guitar the bay guitar they actually like fit together well compositionally this record is listenable and that's great that's good listenable is good and what's also great is that there are no songs on here that are so horribly tasteless that they make me flip backwards in my chair like cocaine so the internet i give them kudos I applaud the strides they made on this record however still Sid the kid is very far from being a captivating vocalist I think she hits her marks more often now especially when it comes to pitch it doesn't sound like she is pushing herself out of her range too much as she was on the Internet's earlier stuff and when she does reach into that upper range of her sometimes it sounds pretty decent there are tracks on this LP like go with it where I'm actually kind of surprised she really pulls through with some passionate vocals and the instrumentals here they're not bad I mean I you could say they're lightly funky and very pleasant to listen to I just think they could use a more captivating singer to really make them come alive and feel like more than just a lightly painted canvas because some of the decent grooves on this LP go a little stale because there's not really anything that interesting going on vocally I think often a lot of the songs here just fall into the background but I will say some of the tracks here do legitimately come through with some head bobbing grooves like on the second half of the song Gaby which features a kind of elusive Janelle Monae feature where where's she on this track I don't know is she on the songs kind of filler like ending that comes through out of nowhere and they're just guides the song out abruptly and the song with Vic mint on here had a great beat as well the track go with it to mention that song again there was a time for the internet where at activating groove seemed like an impossibility and now there are numerous tracks here where that's just what they're doing good good but there's still some stiff moments on this album like on the song I tried and I think that some of these moments could have been overcome if it weren't for the fact that some of the drum programming on this LP gets a little old and flavorless the the percussion the sequenced drums sound kind of flat I just wish there was more live percussion on this thing that's all it most likely would have fit the very smooth and funky tone of the keys the bass and the guitar a lot better because the song special affair does not groove as hard as it could or the song something is missing where I think the thing that is missing is really a groove especially during the instrumental transition in the middle of the track and there are low two moments on here I'm not really all that enthralled with the songwriting going on here there's very few tracks or actually come away thinking oh wow this is a great hook or well this is a great vocal melody right here here's some fantastic you know lyrics or this song has a great structure or something like that I think there are a lot of respects where the Internet still has a lot to learn but I still think this record over here is a vast improvement upon the past - in terms of just sound quality and instrumental quality and at least the vocals are you know falling off pitch left and right or sounding just so amateurish that I can't even sit through this record and so yeah I mean I could sit through this record it's cool to see so many young artists embracing the the neo-soul sound right now I mean it's it's definitely a genre worth resurrecting or I guess rather keeping the torch lit but the vocal bar is just so much higher than where this band is currently reaching if we're looking at a great neo-soul record as is the songwriting bar honestly I'm feeling a light 5 on this LP transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantan oh the internet forever "},{"id":"93EA4JIEgWI","title":"Jonathan Rado - Law & Order ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new Jonathan Rado album Law & Order Jonathan Rado singer-songwriter who you might know from the singing songwriting duo Fox agem who came out with two great full-length projects recently a reissue of the album take the kids off Broadway on jag Jaguar records and earlier this year we are the 21st century ambassadors of peace and magic which was on the same label and what I enjoyed so much about these records especially take the kids off Broadway is that John and and Sam were able to take all of these elements of 60s psychedelic pop and rock classic rock to sort of mash them together in this really jarring way but on top of just sort of being masters of manipulating a lot of these old vintage retro rock and pop sounds Sam and John I thought were really good songwriters wrote great choruses deliver great lyrics and had a lot of passion coming through on the vocals too so of course when I heard that this thing was coming out I was really excited to hear John's talents portrayed in a solo capacity but was somewhat shocked to hear this album fall very short of my expectations usually I'm not the kind of person that goes into solo efforts expecting to be completely blown away anyway because no matter how great the original band may be as soon as an artist is out of their element really anything goes and I feel like Law & Order is a testament to that fact to start with the performances the singing is really lackluster on a lot of these songs either it's not that passionate or captivating or I hear John straining in his upper register a lot on these songs making him kind of unlistenable their songs on here like hand in mine which essentially feel like a bad Adam Greene impersonation and then there are tracks such as looking for a girl like you where we are privy to this horrible falsetto which is just ear piercing Lee it hurts it literally hurts to listen to partially it's because the fall said it was not performed all that well plus there's a heap of distortion on this thing making it pretty unintelligible and on top of that it's not really mixed or eq'd all that well either it's really enough to make you want an instrumental track of which there are a few on here like the song dance away your ego which essentially is just some throwaway cheesy organ rock that I'm never gonna remember and truth is I kind of want to forget it because of how many mistakes are going on in the playing on this track it's like the drums and the guitars aren't even in sync some of the time it's just kind of a little old-school pop rock groove that John can't seem to pull together instrumentally I think the closest that John comes to delivering a decent song is the track faces the melody especially through the guitar leads is really sharp it's catchy but honestly stylistically the song doesn't have all that much personality to it it's not that distinct it's steeped a little bit too much in that whole Brit pop mod rock tradition to be memorable on its own accord and this is surprising to me because because John through Fox agem has a history of taking these sounds and doing something crazy over the top and etc quit them but here on this album we see John treating these sounds he's not even really treating them he's just kind of copying them in this really unflattering way if the production and the singing and the songwriting were up to snuff that would be one thing but man even as kind of a nostalgic trip back this album does not work unfortunately Jonathan Rado on Law & Order when he is not delivering some some bad performances or some weak singing he is just indulging in some generic songwriting that has some very middle-of-the-road retro rock and pop sounds with the exception of the track pot of gold which is a pretty nice drum machine back piece of synth pop and I want a Fela which is like this distorted fuzz doubt psyche rock nightmare that reminds me of something ty Segall would do Segal I will never know occasionally there is a decent tune on here and Jonathan does do a good job of capturing these retro sounds and vibes but I still think a majority this thing is is pretty unlistenable I'm feeling a light for on this album transition if you've given this John Rado album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Jonathan Rado Law & Order forever "},{"id":"cTYg1mAd8tA","title":"Migos - Culture II ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hey everyone barks Annie bark tano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new migos project culture to the amigos that's my favorite group you know all my favorite raps oh you like the migos so much name name their names well you got off step and you got takeout and you got Creepo that's all of them that's what I thought the Atlanta hip hop trio is back and they are quickly following up last year's culture culture one the first culture which easily is one of my favorite trap records period one of the better migos albums out there because while in the past they have displayed a very idiosyncratic style they have written some good hits they've always emphasized quantity over quality and culture was a total change from that migos condense their best characteristics down into a series of very catchy and well-written songs on a pretty trim tracklist that was relatively free of filler I do it for the culture so it's that brevity it's that focus it is that honing of MeeGo songwriting craft that made culture one so good so when I heard them announce culture two I was like awesome hi so excited I hope they like just refine what they were doing on that record and just make it a little bit better and it's just gonna be like amazing one of the best rap albums ever but know that the chances of that dropped exponentially after the album was announced and it was made clear that culture 2 was going to be like an hour and 45 minutes in length like me ghosts are not capable of making an album that long that sounds good it's it's just the truth vocally lyrically instrumentally their music is not versatile enough is not dynamic enough to make a tracklist that long entertaining of course culture too is just going to end up being a glorified mixtape which it in fact is like so many of the songs on this record are wash rinse and repeat you do not write and record this much material in this short of an amount of time since your last album without following a very clear and very repetitive formula even the instrumentals on this thing are painfully formulaic like some of the only tracks that really stood out to me instrumentally notice me was definitely one that instrumental was super mellow super beautiful the made men instrumental was pretty luxurious like I love the glorious and very rich pianos all over that track the laid-back groove it almost kind of felt like maybe a little bit of a throwback to the 90s the Pharrell instrumental on here was insane maybe the most unique in the bunch and had a groove on how a surprise that the migos would even touch flooded is maybe the most skeletal and minimal track on the entire record of course motorsport is a total banger featuring Nicki Minaj and cardi B walk it talked it stuck out quite a bit but maybe only because of its really annoying refrains and walk it and talk it yeah which is really kind of a lot of tracks on here they're actually quite a few songs on here where the hooks the choruses are so obnoxious that I can't help but just they're just really annoying ear worms that stick in my head for all the wrong reasons the bad bitches only course featuring 21 Savage was a relatively big high point for me on the album but honestly the features on here are one of the few things that actually break up the monotony of this record because again there are numerous tracks on here supastarz emoji a chain too much jewelry I would say crown the Kings to many many tracks on this thing basically me goes totally phoning it in with some of their most lackluster and uninteresting lyrics yet along with a bunch of auto-tune singing and ad-libs that you've already heard a million times before like it seems like they're doing as little as they can to advance their sound forward in any significant way but also on top of it water it down to the point where it's so easy to just bust out 24 tracks without really kind of thinking about it because you cannot tell me that these guys spent hours writing the hooks to Gang Gang or to playa or that one line on flooded about pulling up like a pair of Huggies like like a pair of Huggies if you compare culture to with the previous and very lengthy mixtapes that migos have released in the past it's pretty much on par with that it's a slog to listen to it is sooo / tedious your best hopes of enjoying anything on this is to just instantaneously delete anything that you find to be even vaguely boring and just listen to the tracks that you actually like because I actually think there's maybe like a decent album somewhere in the 24 tracks of this thing but me ghosts didn't really take the time to like you know cut it out of the tracklist they just kind of actually left the cutting room floor on the album itself culture 2 is just a mixtape and they're treating it like an album it's it's just really the trio stream trolling just throwing extra tracks onto an album because they know at the end of the day it'll probably get them more streams which honestly I'm not really looking forward to everybody in anybody following this business model in 2018 and 2019 and 2020 and maybe even beyond because it's gonna make listening to albums it's gonna make listening to projects really annoying because even when you do have a high point on this project its significance is really just kind of overshadowed by the mediocrity and the pretty much samey vibe that you're getting from nearly every track that surrounds it yeah I'm pretty much feeling a decent strong four on this thing there's not really a whole lot to say about it it's migos as you've already heard them xeroxed copied and pasted again and again and again until they basically make over 90 minutes of material culture to actually says a lot less about the culture that me goes and the music they're making exists within and really more about a business model that

brings plenty of that on this new album of his gnk is a little bit of a concept album dealing with race religion and God power and ego topics that have been touched down upon multiple times in hip-hop music but rarely does it come off as focused and as well thought-out and is well produced as what I'm hearing here the beats on this project are done by Frank Drake a producer who I'm not particularly familiar with but I do think working with him track for track has resulted in a great project it seems like by working with one dude every twist and turn YC is able to make topically and philosophically Frank Drake is there to accompany it with a very well fitting instrumental like the track the pox which is the first full-length song on this album and with the very drum heavy verses on this track and it's the space around these rhythms with YC flowing over these beats really well it kind of feels like the start of something it's really cinematic it's like a gathering a sermon is beginning and the really grainy keyboard keys that kind of feel like they were played out on a Mellotron or something like that they sound gorgeous and just kiss the intro of this track and the hook really well with the run so that's you can't and this track fits into the overall theme of this album in numerous ways to POC Shakur kind of being revered as a hip-hop God fitting in with that God theme and the PAC's also kind of sounds like the PAC's which is an interesting play on words and the song heavenly I love the instrumental here as well with the soulful vocal sampling and the very jazzy horns it's very beautiful uplifting instrumental and YC comes through with an uplifting message lyrically as well trying to get the listener to think more of themselves and think more directly about their relation to God however even though this seems like a good thing on this track there is sort of a dark side to the mentions of God and religion on this album they come through the strongest on the song God complex a track that is kind of surprised for why I see the cynic because he sings on this song from back to front with a vocal melody that kind of sounds like Suzanne Vegas Tom's diner which is pretty interesting considering that song was sampled on the Milo mixtape that YC appeared on earlier this year I'm just sort of imagining Milo and YC like jam and some Suzanne Vega or something Y C's vocal melody does get a little repetitive throughout the song and it becomes pretty apparent pretty fast that he isn't the greatest singer in the world but he does hold his own he doesn't really sing outside of his vocal range on this track and it's really the lyrics that kind of Wow and keep this song engaging YC talking about how godly he is and using his powers to strike fear in people because he kind of needs people to worship Him in order to feel good about himself in the lyrics he says he'll part the widest ocean and bust the world wide open and with the instrumental in the background just with these plucked beautiful strings being played it just has this really dramatic theatrical element to it that is really fitting the same kind of mentality and in portrayal runs through other tracks on here - like molotovs at Poseidon or power trip except these songs go a little bit harder have some more aggressive instrumentals and you really hear y'see rap on these tracks especially at the star of molotovs episode in which I mean it's it's not a deep set of lyrics that kick this track off but you've just got to kind of imagine what he's saying at the beginning of this song and some interesting and powerful imagery of him being godlike a shooting at Zeus you know I'm cutting through my noose I'm pulling up my roots every bars like this large powerful grandiose gesture that if you think about it actually being a reality it's pretty scary that someone would be that but you do have moments on here like on the track power trip where why see kind of puts his godlike image into a fetal position sort of portraying that there are some chinks in this armor this more vulnerable side of why see is also on display on tracks like the heaviest cross where he kind of directly addresses the fact that he's a musician and he has his issues just like any musician does putting themselves out there when dealing with people that don't like their music whether it be through hateful comments or sort of very critical blog reviews he kind of just comes to the conclusion that this because of his line of work is his cross to bear it's his issue to deal with and then after this he quickly moves on to his mother having her own cross to bear raising kids getting her master's so on and so forth closing track on here being God's her breaks that fourth wall again and addresses the listener directly either thanking them for listening or asking them to kind of take part in spreading the word on this music he again kind of displays a bit of weakness by saying that he feels threatened because he's a free open thinker and that's kind of a dangerous thing for someone to be while I do think it is a really personal and introspective finish to the album I guess my issue is that I didn't really see this song pulling the whole concept of this album together into kind of a nice tight little package that's really my biggest letdown with this LP though even though YC doesn't meticulously assemble this album together in this flawlessly segwayed concept album it doesn't necessarily mean that the songs themselves are bad actually a majority of them are great the only shortcoming on some of the tracks here I think are the hooks why see maybe a god but I think hooks sometimes are kind of his kryptonite either they don't add to the song in a way that's all that meaningful or at least meaningful in an obvious way kind of like on the song Murphy's Law which I think the hook only really makes sense after the second verse when he's kind of talking about the evolution of the mind 999 because on the hook he's essentially saying fuck bitches get money i think the only hook on here that i really disliked was the chorus on know-it-alls not necessarily because it didn't make sense to me but why cease singing on this track is incredibly off pitch and not really in a cute or interesting way just really kind of killed the hook here for me still lyrically it is a very interesting song that plays into ycs relationship I think his relationship with God and when you dive into this album overall even though I feel like it doesn't all tie together in a very clean way it does portray this really deep and personal back-and-forth struggle with these issues that this album addresses like I said earlier God power ego race the last of which is specifically address on the track the n-word all I know is this sort of mental wrestling match is is really interesting blow-for-blow so as far as his lyrics go I find YC to be really fascinating dude vocally I think he does have some personality he's got a bit of a speech impediment that comes through on his vocals a bit but he seems to sidestep it sometimes it doesn't ruin his verses or make them difficult to listen to in my opinion it adds character and as far as his flows go he changes him up he has a good command of flow I wouldn't say he goes ultra fast a lot of the time really he's kind of keeping it at a mid pace to focus on delivering a message in the lyrics I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this album turn so yes I am heavily endorsing this why see the cynic album right now definitely check this thing out if you're an artist like A Tribe Called Quest Kara's one most def del the funky homosapien this review is my opinion only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional magic happy magic love you YC the cynic gnk forever "},{"id":"GloclhybVlQ","title":"Young Thug - Jeffery MIXTAPE REVIEW","y":7,"x":"ah shout out if any out Hanano here a college street I remember what up dude the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new young thug album Jeffery young thug or Jeffrey is a prolific Atlanta rapper songwriter and crooner back with another project it was bound to happen young thug was not going to spend the rest of 2016 silent he's already had a pretty big year with multiple projects under his belt like I'm up and slime season 3 projects that were received well by fans and a lot of major hip-hop critics out there but personally for me by young thug standards these tapes didn't really feel like anything special I really thought thugger was selling himself short on these projects because he has a standout voice but there were so many forgettable choruses and verses on these projects it felt like most of the time he was just kind of going through the motions and not really varying up his flow or his songwriting or even his instrumentals a lot of the time he was just merely putting out the music that fans expected him to put out and at first I didn't really think this new project over here was going to be anything different especially considering this tapes multiple gimmicks which are bound to distract away from the actual content of the music on the front cover here we have Jeffrey featured in his most gender bent outfit yet looking like the female version of Raiden from Mortal Kombat and also uh there are the i grabbing track titles on this thing which i guess were named after people that young thug said on instagram he idolizes among the names in the tracklist harambe the gorilla but also more obvious choices like goo op and RiRi as well as Floyd Mayweather and then Kanye West whose track I read was actually originally named Elton but then pop man which is the ultimate slight in my opinion and totally hilarious that Kanye's track used to be for somebody else you know just like everything else in Kanye's life it was once somebody else's hey put down the keyboard you can stop typing real angry now I have just breaking your balls of course the lyrics on these tracks have about zero to do with the people that they're named after a lot of the time with the exception of tracks like RiRi whose chorus seems to reference her hit song work or the song future swag where young thug tries to do a direct impression of future style and futures music and doesn't do too bad of a job in the process not that futures rapping or singing or whatever you want to call it I was really beyond young thug's talent it wasn't so he kind of just easily hit that mark now you might as well just ignore the track titles on the rest of this thing unless you want them to lead you into a series of false assumptions you have funny moments where gucci mane is featured on the the project but not on the track that is named after him Wyclef Jean is actually featured on the project not on the track that is named after him what I will say is that surprisingly young thug's shallow attempts at trying to get people's attention which he's never not doing actually don't take away from the quality of the music on this tape from track 1 it's clear that this isn't just going to be another thugger project because he is featured riding this instrumental that is so heavily reggae inspired with the upstroke guitars and the very slow rock steady calm rhythm the nice warm resonant bass young thug's lead vocal is incredibly melodic actually catchy and it's backed up and elevated by some beautiful background vocals that make the track feel refine of course in the lyrics here we have Geoffrey threatening people who mess with his money nothing new or incredibly revolutionary by young thug lyrical standards but the track still remains captivating and catchy before I go deeper into this review I will say trying to deeply analyze young thug lyrics and and critique them as if you would like a verse from nas it's a fool's errand I'm not going to do it now the vocal performances and the instrumentals and the hook on this thing stay pretty varied and distinct as we go deeper into the tracklist the song Floyd Mayweather features some of the stickiest flows on the entire project some beautiful piano arpeggios weaved into an eerie beat although I wish that Gucci Mane and Travis Scott on the chorus of the track did a little bit more to break the song up especially when Travis Scott comes through the track feels kind of monotonous at that point especially since his feature is so underwhelming where things really seem to heat up on Jeffery is when the song RiRi comes through which is a fiery passionate track which features pained lead vocals from young thug and a wild chorus where he's talking about how she does that work and she earns it but he says her earn like young thug literally sounds like a seal as he is singing this hook and somehow it works oddly enough the song is as freaky as it is sexually charged whether or not it actually turns you on I'm just going to leave that up to you to decide and then we have the equally good goo op which features young scooter and two members of me goes off set and quavo and this track features an epic wintry just frigid be listening to this instrumental I imagine Jeffrey in the middle of a snowstorm doing karate as snowflakes just fall in slow motion all around him and on Harambee you could say young thug legitimately goes apeshit this is the most aggressive track I've ever heard him on he's screaming his brains out he's all over the place he's just got it all the way in the red and I would love to hear more tracks from him in the future where he goes this ballistic it's a really entertaining cut again I guess it's another track title that you could take literally in a way Harambee most aggressive cut in the track listing here despite the actual meaning of the name Harambee but whatever the song webby is just merely okay doesn't really stand out to me but it fits in to the very refined and pretty instrumental palette of the entire tape and I do give it to young thug for delivering yet another energetic vocal performance in the track listing here and then the closer Kanye West is actually another sort of reggae or dance flavored cut which features even more good vocal melodies especially since Wyclef Jean comes through on this track dominates the second half and there are plenty of moments on this country young thug is punctuating this great instrumental with these really weird vocalizations wait wait hey they're really melodic and rhythmic and they sound much better than what I'm doing right here I'm sorry I liked this project didn't love it but I liked it and I was surprised by that I didn't go into this thing anticipating that I would come out enjoying it as much as I did but I I guess I can't really be too surprised because even at my most disappointed with young thug I always thought that there's potential there you know he seems really eccentric he seems out there he seems on the fridge and he's doing some strange things with his voice if only he would push them into some better written songs some better instrumentals some more memorable hooks or at least you know just experiment a little bit and while this album didn't do all of those things to the point where I'm head over heels for it it did all of them just enough to keep me entertained for the majority of it I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this geoffery tape listen will you be calling a Jeffrey Jeffrey from now on and yelling at people like morons every single time someone calls him young thug let me know down in the comments I'm sure you will did you love this thing did you hate this thing oh it was your favorite track off of it did Harambee go hard let me know okay you guys are the best forever "},{"id":"oiNIJAQWUbY","title":"Run the Jewels - Run the Jewels 2 ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fangio here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new run the jewels record run the jewels did run the jewels is a hip hop duo consisting of southern rapper killer Mike and new york-based rapper producer LP these guys have been one of the most unlikely and super hyped rap team ups of the past few years they started turning heads in 2012 with the entirely LP produced killer Mike album rap music which was highly praised by both fans and critics and LP n killer Mike seeing the success off of this record and basically the chemistry they themselves rivers we're seeing in their creative process decided to solidify this duo with the name run the jewels and they dropped a full-length record just about a year after this killer Mike album even though LP and might come from different walks of life they've had different artistic trajectories when it comes to run the jewels they really get on the same page artistically they kind of get together and meet at this middle ground where they can be straightforward blunt super aggressive brutal but also kind of cunning and clever too a little adventurous I think LP skips a little bit on the wordplay on the technical ability I think killer Mike drops a bit of his southern flavor from the equation too and this is all for the sake of coming together and doing something that is uniquely them still even though this first record of theirs really hit it off the question remains that can they continue this and hold people's attention can they keep it fresh can they keep it entertaining can they come up with some new ideas how far can this newly formed oooooo go are we going to get another black star or can we progress past this first album into something just as good Mike and Jamie certainly seem to hope that that's the case because it looks like they're marketing this album as a sequel to the first album Plus on top of it they're dropping this record just a year after they put out their debut record I guess really hitting while the iron's hot but still a lot of hardcore fans are going to have that debut album in their recent memory and they're going to hear this wasn't going to okay which is a completely fine reaction to have if you feel that way but in my personal opinion I think rtj 2 is better there are super brutal violent and aggressive rhymes all over this record cartoon alee aggressive sometimes hilariously aggressive sometimes as well but I think LP and killer Mike have stumbled upon a newfound just like serious darkness on this record - on some of these tracks I think LPS production on this record in comparison with the debut is way more layered detailed it's got more melody - on some of these tracks it's heavier it's busier it's punch here these beats are weighty and together with the lyrics these songs are about is blunt and straightforward and hard-hitting as like a wall of the coolest graffiti - tumbling over on top of you some of these songs feature numerous parts or have wonderful segues toward the end of them that bring you right into the next track without losing any momentum on the record like the track oh my darling into blockbuster night or all due respect into love again like with the last record Jamie and Mike bring just a handful of features but the features they do bring are super impressive Travis Barker of blink-182 hammering it out on drums on one track we also have Zack de la Rocha of raging as the Machine and gangsta boo of three 6 mafia they're not messing around and a few Underground's somewhat unknowns as well Diane Coffey who you might know as a member or a collaborator drummer for Fox again as well as boots a new york-based songwriter who on this record helped lay down one of the most beautiful choruses on any hip-hop album this year as I said earlier I think LP and killer Mike are finding their dark side on this record are finding a way to make slower more toned-down songs entertaining they do it right at the start of this record with the track jeopardy which is a really odd track for run the jewels they're lurking bass lines all over this thing just like eerie horror movies synthesizers and lead guitars some synth swells once the beat kicks in it's really heavy its lumbering and they're like some kooky saxophone leads all over this thing to LP and Mike bring these really slowly paced gritty grimy verses that really build up the the evil of this record like this song isn't the most evil that the album gets but you know that there's a larger evil coming down the pipe there are other tracks on here too that are equally toned down but a little darker just a little more depressing or even sad at times like the song all my life or even crown where killer Mike is delivering this eye widening lease adverse where he's rapping about dealing drugs to a pregnant woman regretfully however throughout the rest of this record run the jewels is the typically head bashing duo that you've come to know this is like some action movie shit with like LP and killer Mike running in slow motion with like trucks filled with gasoline exploding behind them and like Isis terrorists all around them like shooting at them with their fully automatic assault rifles but like every bullets missing like with the song Omar which has one of the most massive instrumentals on the entire LP really heavy sub bass simple snares coming through some watery swirling keys LP delivers some pimp sea references and some big references there's a hilarious line where he says that someone should run backwards through a field of dicks the instrumental gets noisier and more chaotic as it continues the song isn't exactly delivering any food for thought or anything like that but the lyrics and just the overall tone of the song is hilariously badass same with the song close your eyes and count to fuck LP and killer Mike also deliver some brutal verses here and we have Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine like I mentioned earlier on this beat he is laced into the instrumental itself and it sounds amazing however his verse isn't totally mind-blowing or anything like that but I do think it's better than his appearance on the recent Deltron 3030 record we've got the song lie cheat steal which one of my favorite images on this entire record comes from this song teabagging a piranha tank or the song love again which has another incredibly hefty catchy beat and gangsta boo delivers a verse that is so raunchy that I blushed a little bit nearly every other track on here that isn't you know sort of sadder or more toned down song is it outright banger and I love that about this record but I also love the LP and killer Mike came together and and put forward a full length that is more balanced as well there are some darker tones on this LP and some of the most melodic hooks that LP and killer Mike have delivered yet especially on this track that features Diane Coffey to me this record is run the jewels sounding more distinct sounding more dynamic despite their incredibly aggressive attitudes I think they took some risks on this LP and the results are positive there are a few tracks here the pale in comparison to others but I don't really think there's anything incredibly negative that I have to say about this LP sometimes the more aggressive lyrics on this record can be a little cringe-worthy but that's the kind of tone and story that this album chooses to put forward it's unreasonably mean I mean look at the cover here it is a stick-up going on it doesn't want to hear your sob stories run the jewels man here and there I wish there were some beats that were just a little bit louder so the vocals were we're more immersed in them as opposed to just feeling like killer Mike and LP were just sort of on top of them with just kind of a lot of space between them and the beat some small technical things here and there pretty much but I'm still feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana have a nice day music forever "},{"id":"f0D9IyyeEEU","title":"Macintosh Plus- Floral Shoppe ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review macintosh plus floral shop macintosh plus is the pseudonym of a music producer from america and macintosh pluses latest release along with a few others are currently being celebrated as the dawning of a brand-new genre and yes I understand if you're skeptical given the inconsistency of the last three new genres that we've had like C Punk witch house and chill wave but this new genre is vaporwave vapor wave vapor wave that Wow yes it does sound ridiculous however let's not slag a piece of music simply because of a term thrown onto it because some music fans or music writers are desperate to feel like they're on the cutting edge of something if vapor wave is in fact a genre and does end up being recognized seriously as a genre then it's it's most likely going to just become a sub-genre of plunder phonics sample based compositions songs that take pieces of other songs to build those songs however I'm being told that the artists that are falling under this category of vaporwave are stylistically different from guys like DJ shadow avalanches negative land girl talk as well as John Oswald the man who coined the word plunder phonics and I guess primarily what makes vaporwave different from other plunder phonics styles is its source material many projects in this genre of music that are most notably found on the beer on the rug Bandcamp page stick pretty passionately to using samples from smooth jazz incidental music from maybe commercial television shows from the late 80s late 90s contemporary R&B maybe even adult oriented rock new age music and synth funk as well like the kind of sounds that Brian Eno was creating for Windows back when he was creating the Windows sound and maybe it's music that you've had contact with if you've watched funny videos or TV commercials on everything is terrible calm or even seen a few sketches on Tim and Eric awesome show great job if you're at all familiar with those last two things you know that this kind of music is is constantly made a joke of by a lot of people however there is a growing post-ironic desire to listen to and and wholeheartedly enjoy this kind of music which is just the weirdest thing to me not that it's not enjoyable but it's funny that in the internet age you can pretty much find and listen to anything and almost anything can find an audience and there are plenty of other artists that have made use of the sounds that vaporwave consists of for their own musical gain artists like Neon Indian for example maybe Arial pink as well and and especially an artists like James Ferraro now vaporwave takes this kind of music and manipulates it cuts it loops it maybe pitch shifts it as well and specifically in the case of Macintosh plus it's almost like a chopped and screwed version of all these genres in the source material so again stylistically theoretically not that different from other plunder Phonics artists it really relies heavily on the kind of music it's sampling and the vibe that it gets from that and that vibe consistently from track to track on this LP is smooth synth-heavy kind of sexy the second track on here is a slowed down version of Diana Ross's your move with a few choice grooves in the song cut and looped over and over and over and over until Macintosh Plus finally decides to kind of give up the chorus and the end result with these really vocals crooning out it's just a combination of sweet and eerie it does have a good and kind of interesting sound to it but I have to attribute that more to the songwriting and the way the song was produced as opposed to how the sounds were manipulated because how Macintosh Plus edits a lot of these songs it's it's kind of boring it's it's really uninspired it really lets the song do all of the work it's not like taking a song and turning it into a new song it's really kind of like making a slowdown dance edit of the very same song that you're editing around the middle point of the track there's some slapback echo it gets super slow toward the end but there's really no hint of some very creative loops or cuts on the fourth track Macintosh Plus kind of lets the sample the song rather do the work again it's a revision of the pace song you need a hero which again has a likable sound but is not impressively assembled it's not until the third or fifth track on this LP that McIntosh plusses editing skills actually get used to make a different song out of its source material on track three there are a lot of Skippy loops and edits to kind of build some original grooves out of the samples there's some deep bass and really silky smooth synthesizer and macintosh plus repeats some pivotal parts of these beats in the way a DJ would if the song were being cut live but I really have no assumption that anything on this album is being done on the fly and on the fifth track here all of these synthesizer loops all these piano sounds are taken off of a track and looped placed over one another and just kind of repeated reverb was thrown on top and it becomes a bit of an ambient piece but honestly it was a little underwhelming the only more ambient style piece on this album that I thought was really impressive was the seventh track actually like that from beginning to end the layers of synthesizers on that track got really ethereal and I like the way the saxophone kind of melted through it if anyone is going to be impressed by this LP it's most likely going to be people who have not heard the songs that are sampled on this album first because by sample-based music the editing the looping again just the execution is is really underwhelming leaves a lot to be desired there's nothing on this LP that wasn't done better on an album like OneNote Rick's point numbers replica or Daniel o Patton's other project Chuck Pearson's echo jams Volume one which samples a lot of the same kind of music and is actually way more bold with its editing and it's looping and it's stretching of some of the songs that it uses aside from being underwhelmed by most of these tracks there were a lot of songs on here that I did not like it all like the opening track where it's basically one section of a song crashing violently into another section that just sounds terrible and just incongruent and on the bonus tracks that come with the latest edition of this album there is a horrible stretched out version of I only have eyes for you the the zapf cover I actually find sample-based music to be pretty interesting I think the possibility is truly are endless but Macintosh Plus is is not even trying to explore a lot of those possibilities and and that's my number one issue with this LP I'm actually feeling a decent too strong for on this album certainly it sounds nice it has style but there's really not much there in terms of how its assembled if you've given this a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should i review next and that's it Anthony Fantana macintosh plus vaporwave forever "},{"id":"QVtTjuLERT4","title":"Bones - Garbage MIXTAPE REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new bones mixtape garbage bones is an Internet rapper I was first introduced to his work earlier this year through the teen witch mixtape and I have publicly stated through a certain social media platform that I think it's the worst mixtape of 2014 mostly because a lot of the songs on this tape take inspiration straight from the Columbine shootings which in concept isn't necessarily a bad thing I mean many artists over the years have tributed great tragedies in American history however in this particular instance the execution was so lazy boring and uninspired that I couldn't help but feel of this project was merely just exploiting the tragedy however I did come away from this tape and other bones tapes after listening to teen --which liking his aesthetic dark atmospheric cloud wrap with a southern trap flavored flare something three 6 mafia fans can get into if they like their lyrics a little more spaced out a little more glazed over and with the production sounding a bit more modern somebody who's into little ugly man I think can get into but for me personally the the pitched vocals the pitched down vocals aren't really there to be so distracting bones really just delivers his straightforward normal regular voice I've seen some people compare bones to yung lean to however it's it's really not that much of a comparison because I think bones has been doing it longer I think the tone of his songs is darker more somber more serious his lyrics don't feel quite as absurd a lot of the time but I understand how some people could just misconstrue bones for just another Internet emcee and at the end of the day maybe maybe he is who knows he does have the simple straightforward trap beats the emphasis on atmosphere his deadpan and ice-cold delivery makes him feel a little lifeless and lethargic at times there is the occasional gaudy use of auto-tune on this record - and there are moments where bones lyrics sounds like he's just completely making them up off the top of his head while totally stoned out of his mind and a lot of songs on the cell P just end abruptly and are not that fleshed out most of the tracks on this project laying around that one or two minute mark the entire tape even though it has over 15 tracks lands around 30 minutes in length throughout garbage there are some glaring flaws but in a lot of ways this tape is actually what I would like to be hearing in the darker moodier underground side of hip-hop right now this tape is actually almost what I would have wanted to hear out of this Space Ghost perp album that dropped on 4ad a few years ago because even though in Bones lyrics there are elements of current day swag rap and braggadocio money violence drugs so on and so forth there are some really depressing dark introspective moments as well there's some conceptual tracks on here where I'm actually big as verse is kind of clever like on Linksys broadband router where all of his lyrics have to do with internet modern-day technology it's a little tongue-in-cheek but still manages to pull together a very real dark vibe my favorite track in this line being URL blunts - my IRL face and not only are there dark dank trap flavored cloud rap songs on this LP but they're also tracks that incorporate some acoustic guitar pretty beautifully like on the track lay me in the river which has this guitar lead that sounds like some early Modest Mouse guitar lead there's some real elements of self-hate in the lyrics that bones brings to the table on this track but as dark and as sad as his songs feel sometimes it's very clear that he doesn't take himself that seriously there is the song if you had a Zune I hate you which is actually really more of a spooky black song where he's singing all over the track it's actually one of the better recorded songs I've heard him on I do not care for his black silk tape project whatever I don't think his vocals are that strong I don't think the recording is that good I don't think the beats are that great to me it's absolutely boring but this song in particular I did find somewhat captivating even though it did end short and there are a few good collab tracks I'm here with some features from Xavier Wulf as well as Eddie Baker but even the songs on here that I like they just tend to end really abruptly again it's that brevity keeping a lot of the songs on this LP from really leaving a lasting impact on me even though they may start well and they bring a good tone and vibe and maybe some decent lyrics to the table but a lot of them just cut out a little too soon and I'm left wanting more and even though I do like this project that's kind of the overall thing I'm just left wanting more a little bit more in terms of the length of these songs a little less filler and a little more lyrically as of right now I think bones is putting out some interesting stuff I think he has a style I think he has an interesting direction going for him but I'm kind of left wondering if he really has the ambition to push his projects beyond projects like this I don't doubt that a guy like bones has the potential to put out a better project but I'm kind of wondering if ambition is actually in the game plan for a lot of these internet rappers who just kind of seem to be putting out sort of apathetic somewhat nihilistic projects I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you give in garbage listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review

ranks are filled with indie rock veterans Carrie Brownstein Mary Timoney Rebecca Cole Janet Weiss between the four of them they've worked in the spells sleater-kinney the minders the go-betweens and that's not even like close to the full list of projects that they've been affiliated with and to me they are playing indie rock on this album but it's this really simple fun catchy kind of muscular style of indie rock it's not this cheap glossy pretend happy like stereotype reinforcing brand of indie rock that gets thrown at us all over the internet that of all the group's wild flag is affiliated with I think sleater-kinney is going to warrant the most comparisons especially since Carrie Brownstein is kind of fronting the band but even though those comparisons will be made I don't think this album really leaves off where sleater-kinney did in 2005 with woods which was a really noisy experimental kind of emotionally intense album to me wild flag takes a detour from that intensity and takes just just a more scenic route I think longtime sleater-kinney fans will see parallels between this and an older album like dig me out the faster catch your tracks from that album but still wild flight by comparison is noticeably different to me the post-punk spirit is here but none of the the sorrow or pain or angst it's a terrible word I know but of the angst that fueled some of those sleater-kinney LPS just is not here it shows up a little bit on some of my favourite tracks like boom where Carrie Brownstein is singing in this really kind of eccentric kind of slightly deranged vocal or even future crimes which is a little upset and a little desperate in a way that I like but the thing is for the most part this album really kind of has no tears to shed I mean this album is really in too good of a mood to be depressed or all that self-aware wild flag is writing songs about glass tambourines and electric bands and throwing haze and Yaz and okay's and all rights into their lyrics I could totally see Carrie Brownstein playing these songs live and like doing windmills on her guitar or something that's how upbeat this album feels to me even in its most depressing moments the drums are really sharp and snappy the bass lines have a lot of spunk bunk the organs are kind of quirky and I like that and the guitar leads are just rough and wild they just wail when I first heard this LP I kind of questioned it because of how simple it is you know oh it's you know it's it's so simple it's not really all that intricate but as I listened to it more I kind of ended up enjoying how free of of complications it is there's no weird abstract deeper layer to this album what you see is is what you get and what you get is just a nice attitude and a group of 10 songs that kind of just want to rock and there's a nice variety among these songs too I don't feel like I'm hearing the same song over and over and over these guys write a group of tracks that land around two or three minutes but they could totally just change gears pull out a 6-minute track like racehorse with this drum being guitar riff that reminds me of Fugazi and yet it still sounds good and for the duration of the song they stay engaging there's a consistent sound and style on this the production is pretty good in my opinion I feel like the songs that were on that wild flag 7-inch that came out earlier this year that got reworked for this open you came out pretty good there were moments like something came over me that felt a little underwhelming to me but overall I thought it was a very good debut but I think some fans are gonna look for more from this album considering who is is making it and I and I have to admit I did too a little bit but still what's kind of interesting is that all these members in wild flag kind of seem to have brought themselves back to square one with this band in a good way because they're kind of writing and performing as if this is like their first band almost all the members of wild flag sound really excited to be making this album they sound really energized this album feels really fresh it feels really new it doesn't feel like the Reformation that it actually is to me so to me this album is just kind of like an assembly of catchy tracks it's nothing mind-blowing but it is solid it is dependable and it is admirable I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this but what do you think did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana wild flag forever

neighbourhood album it's its self-titled these guys were a California pop outfits their third full-length album spearheaded by frontman and songwriter jesse rutherford the group has been popping for a number of years now with a lot of incredibly viral internet singles daddy issues blue flowers some of the teaser tracks to this new album have been doing the rounds on YouTube as well previously the neighborhood's music didn't really stop me in my tracks it felt kind of run-of-the-mill mostly it was just very shiny primped indie rock and pop with lots of lyrics about love interests some very moody atmospheres as well but despite how heartbroken and how dark some of the music might have felt I always found their stuff kind of safe kind of bland very average with a lot of colorless keyboards and boring lead vocals lifeless beats and very ethereal toothless guitars that kind of serve as a reminder of the guitars plummeting cultural stock even on some of the neighborhood's most compelling tracks like r.i.p to my youth you're just kind of getting slightly above average singing some very subpar mixing as well I mean yeah sure some of the lyrics on this tracker kind of sad kind of cutting but the song is just pretty much wrapped in this vague malaise that doesn't really add up too much honestly I'm more sad when I run over a squirrel by accident in my car which is a legit sad thing you should not be killing living things if you can keep yourself from doing so go vegan the neighborhood's latest record sees their sound getting diversified a little but they're not just simply a moody indie rock and pop band anymore now the band's high gloss finish comes with elements of electro and synth pop as well as a splash of R&B hanging in the air too but damn this this does not sound any more interesting what is this album is it m83 recording bland or music under another name so he can sell double the amount of albums to forever21 shoppers is it MGMT being forced to stop being weird at gunpoint is it God telling Sufjan Stevens that he needs to make music to appeal to white alternative R&B fans or else he's not gonna be able to meet Jesus when he goes to heaven the aesthetic of this album is so gray gray gray it's so painfully drab just the sound of this thing the instrumentals it's very low impact I mean occasionally a vocal melody on the hook will kind of pop a little bit but again low impact and it does not help that most of the time the lyrics are super insipid and delivered in this I don't know this gutless baby man voice the lyrics on this thing are so plain and boring an unimaginative and don't really describe much of anything in an interesting way I feel like this is the way you would talk about a woman or relationship if you're just super attractive and you're not the type of person who really needs to say anything interesting or slick to get somebody to be interested in you I feel like I'm just kind of chewing on a piece of stale white bread I mean I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody is a cute sentiment definitely one of the nicer messages I've ever heard come across in a love song I can certainly give the neighborhood that but still the poetry that you find on this thing is is just about as shallow as what you might find on a chain-smoker song it actually kind of makes the chainsmokers look like frickin Shakespeare this record lyrically instrumentally vocally I just feel like I'm being subjected to 40 minutes of sexy suburbanite sadness it's kind of like I'm trapped in a tacky black and white perfume commercial that plays during primetime on MTV or vh1 it's just kind of one moody forgettable pop tune after another and I don't know it kind of gets even more weird awkward and cringy as the band tries to incorporate these distorted dark R&B elements yeah I'm not digging this this is this is very much not for me I'm feeling a light too decent for on this transition have you given this album a listen

time for a review of the new Tim Hecker record loves streams experimental electronic music artist Tim Hecker here with his new full-length album the follow-up to 2013's virgins my favorite album of that year and I recommend that you check out that record and any number of albums from his very deep back catalog now this album virgins was also compounding a lot of the very apocalyptic and sharp dark and painfully sad sounds that were coming from his previous record as well raid death 1972 both albums collectively could soundtrack the end of the world now loves streams though definitely brings a change of pace at least for the first half of the record this album by comparison seems a little fuzzier exists more on a synthetic plane it's a little more heavenly ethereal warmer and also with this record we see the addition of vocals and not just like you know a lead vocalist and we're getting some kind of you know lyrical message or narrative here nothing like that we're getting vocals as more of an abstract sound purely as an instrument we're getting harmonious choral group vocals which are very smooth and gentle or like in the case of the song violet monumental number two we're getting what seems like strange sampled vocal manipulations all layered on top of one another for a really disorienting effect and if there's another thing about this record that I noticed sort of a trend that pops up here and there is that there are occasionally these really loud jutting heavy bass e synth leads and phrases that just really stab so far outside of the very light ethereal drones occurring in the background and it kind of reminds me of the occasionally disjointed synth work that you might catch in the music of OneNote Rick's point never or Daniel lopatin which isn't too surprising considering that Daniel and Hecker not too long ago put out a collaborative record Tim usually seems like the the kind of artist to keep his contemporaries close at his side especially considering that fellow experimental and ambient music artist Ben Frost is collaborating with him on this record once again Tim also returns to Iceland for the recording of this album - and it would seem that all the elements of the previous equations that made Tim hacker's music so great they're here but this album just isn't as enthralling as Tim's recent work in my opinion and it's it's for several different reasons one I think a lot of the songs on this record fail to reinforce one another in any significant way leaving a lot of the tracks here feeling is if they are just lone islands or motifs or vignettes rather than an overall album and overall piece which is something I enjoy quite a bit about many Tim Hecker records and I think part of this disconnect is due to a lot of the weak endings and segues on these songs right from the start the track Obsidian counterpoint the track certainly starts off with a bang or at least I guess as much of a bang as you could expect from a Tim Hecker album those punchy bass e synth phrases I talked about being matched up with these woodwind leads and then as these progress there is a growing wall of synth layers that they're all kind of swimming in and then eventually all of this heavier more pungent instrumentation just fades away and just gives way to a very mild drone that for a moment almost sounds like it's just going to fade out it really kills the momentum of the track which I know sort of sounds weird when you're talking about this type of music but one thing I've always enjoyed about Tim Hecker's music is that despite it being so vast and so abstract it usually has a very strong sense of direction and pace to it not so much here I think the last third of this track is really just a lot of compositional dead air the song music of the air sort of fails to progress in any meaningful way as well once the song reaches a certain point of peak layers of instrumentation with vocals and layer after layer of very treble e thin synthesizers and some groaning bass and while progress is one thing there are some moments here where I feel like all the respected pieces of instrumentation within a given track fail to line up sort of like on the track of Bee Gees dream I'm not pronouncing that correctly I'm sorry the textures are pretty but the song mostly seems to consist of these several improvised or semi-improvised synth layers that just do not complement one another and then the track just dissipates I guess due to lack of direction I think the first legitimately enthralling moment on the record is violent monuments parts one and two the very bright droning synthesizers on this track and the very ghostly vocal edits come together into something that's both beautiful and kind of scary and there are these very subtle alterations to the music as the track progresses along to keep the intensity up the track sounds like it's haunted by poltergeists or something but then with this song like many others on here we reach a point where it sounds like the instrumentation is just fading to black but not quite so that it's just suddenly over it's kind of this weird middle-of-the-road fade it's like Tim wants the track to be over but it's not so quiet that it's going away but it's not so loud that it's kind of in the forefront of my mind and the second part of this two-part piece I guess I enjoy more in theory than I do in practice there are some very hypnotic synth layers here that are hitting this kind of skipping groove pattern and then all of a sudden these lumbering Basie woodwinds come in and just Hulk and stomp their way through this ambient sense scape but after a while even though I think these two textures together are interesting musically I just don't see a lot here complementing each other I think compositionally these elements are a little mismatched and the track loses steam because of it and here we actually have a song that just suddenly fades out of nowhere it's just done and again we're just kind of left with one track that does not connect meaningfully to the next track in the track listing on the song castrati stack Tim Hecker brings back some sounds that feel like they would have fit a little better into the album we are getting these glistening synth layers once again matched with some harsh just sudden sporadic distortion the vocals that have been so prominent thus far on the album are worked in again and it's it's a it's a winning combination it functions at least for this part of the album and even though I think Tim is pulling back to his previous record a little bit here this part of the album is indicative of a trend or progression in the album itself because the last several tracks here in comparison with the beginning of the album are kind of dark the song voicecrack following this is even more textured where rather than harsh shots of distortion we kind of had these glitchy what sounds like guitar samples just move a lot gargling or just hurting and jerking unpredictably over this very smooth synth scape it's pretty brain tingling and so not a deterioration is exactly that it sounds like many of the sonic elements featured previously in this album are kind of just melting away or becoming more sour more dissonant it's at this point on the album that I'm recognizing a theme it seems like the songs are connecting a little bit better but with the track black phase I mean to me this is just another unfinished moment in the album here as it suddenly fades out like many other tracks previous to it this record just did not feel as fully fleshed out as Tim Hecker's recent work and for a good part of the album it seemed almost as if to me that Tim was recycling a lot of the same sounds and textures over and over again just to kind of create this very gauzy aesthetic for this album above them I mean on the fourth track here I almost had a deja vu moment it was almost as if I was listening to the three tracks previous to it but sort of at a different angle or something unfortunately I just did not really get that much out of this album you know I hate to feel this way this was one of my most anticipated records of the year and Tim has made some of my favorite electronic music albums experimental albums ambient if you want to throw that label on to it and I think there are some good compositional moments here too it's just that very few here glide into the next in a cohesive way or stick the landing when they finish momentum is never kept up the dots are never completely connected I think the warmer sonic aesthetic of this record and the vocals were certainly enough to bring a nice sonic change of pace to Tim's progression here it is discography but this record just did not seem as compositionally meaty as I've known his work to be in the past I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this album Tran transition have you given this album a listen if you have did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Tim Hecker loved streams click on some over here the subscribe button the website go check out another review over here click on

busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new titus andronicus album a productive cough this is the fifth full-length album from Glen Rock New Jersey band Titus Andronicus a group that despite some lineup changes and music style changes over the years is still the the brainchild of singer-songwriter Patrick Stickles and I went into this record with a lot of positive vibes a lot of happy thoughts not just because I thought some of the teaser material for it sounded really good but also the band's last album the most lamentable tragedy was truly a record that lived up to its name it was like this overly long unbearably lo-fi folk rock opera in five acts in one breath while I appreciated the ambition of this LP that Patrick was really reaching for the stars with it I also found the album to be kind of unlistenable this new album though is much more manageable by comparison it's just seven tracks that are 46 minutes in length and for the most part it sounds like Patrick and company are indulging the sounds of like bar band rock or some Heartland rock but with a socially conscious edge that takes a more punk-rock and anarchist tone which in concept for me sounds like a pretty cool idea I mean this style of music is typically pretty blue-collar doesn't shy away from addressing or talking about the problems that face and affect the working-class and that is an element of this genre that Patrick is really quick to embrace especially on tracks like realtalk as well as is more personal rendition of Bob Dylan song like a rolling stone my issue with this album though comes mostly down to execution because even though I like what titus andronicus is doing aesthetically the performances and the writing on this album will leave a lot to be desired because their tracks on this thing that become painfully tedious before they're even close to finishing like the song Real Talk we're at the five-minute mark you pretty much get the idea of the song if someone so says that such-and-such is this bad then we're in for a really bad or wha that's pretty much the lyrical rubric for the entire track and it gets so tiresome maybe if I was in a bar and saying loudly with other people with a few beers and me it would sound more exciting but hmm and then we have the song home alone which yet again is another piece of very strung out bar band rock which does very little to justify its 8 minute runtime outside of some very mild jamming and guitar solos and reiterating maybe some of the most silly refrains Stickles has ever wrote mommy's not home daddy's not home nobody's home I'm home alone like what and then you have the vocal performances on this thing like on the opening track number one in New York the song sounds like the longest and worst sing-along ever it's kind of like a teary-eyed piano let pub rock tune but there are all these vocal layers on the track half of which sound like they are trying to sing the song and a slurred drunken stupor meanwhile another chunk of the vocals sound like they've forgotten the lyrics entirely and they're just trying to mouth along with what Patrick is singing it sounds really terrible really sloppy and I kind of get the same vocal vibe off the song mass-transit madness which to me is is just as unlistenable there are a couple strokes of genius on the album above the bodega for sure is one a really catchy passionate tune it's hard not to get wrapped up in especially since the lyrics and the message of the song are so smart basically talking about how easy it is to confide in or find comfort in strangers and and the difficulty patrick has keeping secrets from them I really love the lyrics of the track crass tattoo despite the fact that it is yet another moment that I feel the vocal performances are kind of underwhelming and uninteresting I really love the lyrics on the track crass tattoo even if it is a song that to me vocally is very underwhelming and then I really do enjoy Titus Andronicus his rendition of like a rolling stone I like the angle of personal suffering that Patrick takes with the lyrics as he kind of changes them to be about him instrumentally their take on the track is actually really fun wild sweaty it has a certain kind of gusto to it while staying very true to the original blueprint of the song but outside of those couple of cuts I really don't enjoy much about this album it just feels to me to be like a an unsatisfying mess it's like on the cusp of something great and yet it continues to shoot itself in the foot again and again and again as I think Patrick and company kind of rely a little bit too much on this whole heartland rock aesthetic to make the album appealing when really it should be the songs and it should be the singing and it should be the musicianship that pulls listeners in not the novelty of mimicking the sound of a bar band I'm feeling a light too decent five on this thing transitioned have you given

zero can cut you'll fill out a change.org petition you hi everyone Tiffany Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new beach slang album let's let's get this right the things we do to find people who feel like us these guys are a Philly rock band recent poly vinyl records signees this is you know their first big commercial coming-out party they teased up to the release of this album with a few pretty good singles and they saw fit to give this album the garish title of the the things we do to find people who who feel like us that's the title and not a single song about OkCupid or Craigslist hookups okay hold on I think I got it beach slang what they're doing here is the action stated in the title in order to find people who feel like they do they're coming out with an alternative rock record that's gutsy but gauzy and as a strong pop sensibility and really impassioned lead vocals they then lace these songs with rich heavy harmonious guitars really thick production a little shoegaze e and then they record that music get signed to a label so that they can then tour the nation know the world in order to meet people who feel the same way that they do about these alternative forms of rock music from the 90s kind of elaborate guys not really necessary but at least the end result of the band's efforts is a decent rock record it's not the most distinct sound on the block and there are times when I wish the vocals were a little less garbled but this is an incredibly sharp debut album all the same this thing is no BS there's 10 or so tracks here and only one song on the album sneaks past the 3-minute mark and even though all the tracks on this thing are relatively short the songs are succinctly written they have very defined verses and choruses very sharp endings and the hooks are very explosive and melodic even if they are a little simple sometimes the performances are electrifying their visceral there's definitely a punk energy to a lot of these tracks and the emotional palette of this thing is is a good mix of a little bit of angst but also some feel-good vibes as well the opening track here actually kicks this album off on a positive note with these really righteous the lyrics talking about how the streets ain't got no guts or at least that's what I'm hearing these song ride the wild breeze is one of the more aggressive tracks here a real barnburner that has a gnarly guitar riff with tears welled up in its eyes cuz so just determined the vocals are a little tortured kind of raspy you remind me a bit of Nirvana or like bush there's definitely a little bit of Japan droids mixed in there too somewhere the chorus on this thing brightens up sounds really heavenly the song young and alive is similarly throttling the acoustic number too late to die young isn't that bad either it's cool to hear the band try something a little more stripped back and it goes over very well and outside of these more aggressive cuts outside of these softer cuts many of the other songs here are very mid pace they're not really aggressive but they had this overwhelming bliss that I loved like with the song bad art in weirdo ideas a track that I like a lot despite the kind of cliched twangy lead Beach style guitar in the mix hanging around typically I avoid anything that's indie rock and named after the beach but this is definitely a pleasing exception then we have songs like noisy Heaven and I break guitars which pack tons of indie rock euphoria into these little two-minute sized bits the LP doesn't overstay its welcome it's like 27 minutes long although around the halfway point the band I think has explored their very simple formula as well as I think they were going to they've kind of showed their whole deck of cards overall I thought this is a good LP it's it's a little OneNote but the songs that do very much of the time are pretty great and even though the thing is short this band makes every minute of the 27 minutes in this runtime count again I stress that these songs are tightly just tightly written not a single note out of place I love the production I think the performances are good again I wish the vocals were a little bit more distinct but I do like that rasp they bring to the table and the performances are again electrifying have a lot of energy not a whole lot of complaints about this thing didn't blow me away but it's a really good rock record I don't really hesitate to recommend I'm feeling a strong sentiment of an on this thing transition have you given this album a listen and if you have or do you think of it they love it they hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music rock beats lying forever

for an album review the latest LP from Fleet Foxes helplessness blues Fleet Foxes is a Seattle band which produces very heavenly very ambitious acoustic music call it folk call it baroque call it indie folk call it whatever this my needle drops is the most romantic record of 2011 this LP is romantic because it's such an idealist album it finds love it finds beauty in in everything it finds inspiration joy melody poetry in in apples and even the fur of a collie and there's something about that that just captivates me and I'm sure a lot of people will be singing the second album blues over this LP you know is this one better is that better what does couch your chest to think you know I would buy that I'm very allergic to fish see that that doesn't even make sense because it doesn't matter what matters is do you enjoy this album I do a lot actually of course this band sound hasn't changed greatly since their last LP Fleet Foxes still has a very all guns-a-blazing approach to spinning these acoustic yarns bringing in every instrument that they can get their hands on from pianos to strings to flutes doubled-up guitars a free jazz sax phone on one of these tracks and of course the band's gargantuan vocal harmonies a better recording quality of this LP more arrangements more effects this thing just sounds like a bigger production plus I love the vocal reverb on this thing it just sounds so natural doesn't sound really synthetic like a lot of reverb do today it sounds like they're singing in a Grand Hall of some sort it's a lot to take in at once it's not easily digestible in one sitting and because of that because so much is going on things could easily go awry if you throw in too many ingredients your soup can quickly turn into slump and maybe to some of you this album sounds like nothing but an acoustic mess with vocal harmonies over it and if it does feel that way I implore you listen a little harder and also stop listening to your low bitrate album leak that you downloaded somewhere off the internet because for me this album is built so intricately it's built so masterfully I love that I can pull little sonic details from it every single time I visit it like the little strings plucking away in the right channel quietly on Sim salabim and the little notes that I pull out every time of the guitar jam at the end of that song and I really love the song subjects and the theme going on with this LP what I perceive to be a theme that is my favorite of which being helplessness blues a track that I reviewed earlier this year and to me that song is just about realizing that you're you're just a small part of this grand grand world and I haven't heard anybody sing about that with any sincerity real sincerity and passion since the microphones and that track is also just about wanting to serve a greater purpose in life something that maybe is a little more fulfilling and I can relate to that feeling sometimes I wonder if I'm on the right path sometimes I wonder if doing this is the right thing to do to me helplessness blues everything fleet as have done in the past has been improved from sound to melody to songwriting the unconventional song structures is just everything everything everything but I can still smell cynicism bubbling up fleet foxes have done this before Simon & Garfunkel crosby Stills and Nash have done this before I feel like there are some legitimate claims that could be made like maybe the vocal harmonies and the extra instrumentation in this album and maybe with Fleet Foxes just in general maybe it could be a little overbearing for some people maybe a lot of songs here kind of fizzle out or just end in a very unexpected way but I think that has created a situation that I really love about this album and that is when I put this on I really have to listen to it from beginning to end because I feel like every song here would be weaker if you pulled it out of the album and listened to it by itself every track has a different part of the story to tell in this old dusty leather-bound book that I'm flipping through in a rocking chair on a creaky wood floor next to a window with the morning light creeping in fires lit five feet away from me an old hound dog is sitting at my feet and I am sipping some herbal tea I mint so I'm feeling a light to decent 9:00 on this one guys uh enjoying it a lot but you know what scores don't matter listen to this for yourself make your own decision and if you don't like it you don't like it all right but I love it I'm loving it okay all

amanda and it's time for a review of the new holly herndon record platform Holly Herndon is an electronic music producer whose style relies heavily on these jittery glitchy techno beats laced with some of the strangest vocal manipulations I've heard on record I first ran into Holly's music in 2012 through her album movement an album that was pretty intriguing had some mind-bending ideas on it though there were some songs that kind of felt like very short unmemorable motifs or detours and the whole album itself was a pretty short of breath but still this LP and Holly kind of sounded like they were onto something and with this newest LP over here I wouldn't necessarily say it's a more coherent or more enjoyable record than movement but it is definitely longer and shows Holly trying to flesh out some of the ideas on her last LP past some of these very abstract and rough sounds now I did love the singles leading after the release of this LP the song home as well as the track chorus a track that when it kicks off it sounds like this faint electronic art pop jam but then it eventually becomes this bustling electronic music track with these multiple soft voiced vocal layers and now that I hear in the context of the record it's not terrible but I do wish there were at least a few vocals that were just a little bit louder and and bolder to kind of kick out of the mix of vocals on this track a bolder voice kind of like on the song unequal and experimental vocal cut that lands later in the tracklisting here where we get some singing that is very dramatic it's slow it's just a little more urgent and upfront and louder - sometimes when Holly throws a lot of vocals into these songs they don't end up so much disorienting and kind of glitchy like they were on movement rather they just bleed together into this I don't know wall of mush but home and chorus are our two of the more accessible tracks in the tracklisting here there are more oddball songs here like unequal where we kind of get this very slow like I said urgent and dramatic singing against this kind of glitchy non-musical backdrop it's it's it's a bit of a it's it's just an abstract piece these vocals are literally paired with just some kind of strange unpredictable sound effects just going on in the background on paper and in theory I guess it's an interesting combination of sounds and ideas but as I'm listening to it there wasn't anything too intriguing or moving about it then we have the song Locker leak which sounds in a way like a bit of Laurie Anderson esque spoken word set against some vocal harmonies as I listened to the track I kind of realized that the spoken word kind of sounds like it could be copy from like advertisements or something like that hearing stuff like be the first of your friends to try this product it was kind of strange and then with the song lonely at the top this track felt like pure a.s.m.r if you don't know what that is look it up there actually a lot of youtube videos about it where you kind of have these people that are just kind of in hopes to elicit some kind of you know tingly feeling moving throughout your body or just kind of in your ears or in your head look it up well anyway this track is essentially an ASMR piece where Holly is not only just speaking throughout the entirety of the song in this very soft voice no music or anything and this is for several minutes but it also kind of has a storyline to it too I feel like I'm listening to some kind of - to people I think that we're supposed to be hearing two people here maybe twins or something like that the person talking is always referring to we and us outside of the person that they're supposed to be talking to and these people I'm sort of guessing from the dialogue on this track our masseuses or like escorts or something like that you know they seem to be servicing this person in some kind of fashion and they're always talking about like oh I don't know how you do it you're so amazing you work so hard I'm glad that you're taking out the time to take care of yourself so on and so forth it's an interesting idea and the first time I've ever heard of this kind of thing on a musical album but uh you know it's it's it doesn't really do too much for me in the tracklisting here and I mean it you know really adds nothing to the flow of this thing I mean it just kind of adds to the overall feeling that this album is just a mixed bag of some strange and some more accessible ideas there are sweeter and just easier to digest songs in the tracklisting here aside from the singles like the track morning Sun this track has a nice vocal melody to it love the refrain although I wish the lead vocals went a little bit harder because they do blend into the other vocal layers a little bit too much like on chorus and on home it's kind of strange Holly does pull together some intriguing ideas on this more accessible as well as the more experimental side of the fence but rarely do these two worlds come together on this record we're either getting something that you know seems very very sweet and very very straightforward if a little muddy it points with the vocals and then we're just getting these completely just whacked out ideas kind of like lonely at the top if there was just a little bit more crossover I could have seen this album being more consistent and maybe even more interesting too because I mean you know some pop song were to kind of develop out of that ASMR vocal sound that could actually be you know kind of refreshing and new I liked the song and exit as well which also features a pretty great vocal melody it is a little Bjork ish at points not really a vibe that came through on Holly's last album quite as much as it does on this particular track and the song Dow which has this heavy industrial be really primal feel to this rhythm is one of the more exciting and hard hitting cuts in the tracklisting here too and on this song some of the vocal experiments and glitches and manipulations are much stranger as strange as what they used to be on movement the they just don't seem to be as out there on this record consistently and and Dow definitely sticks out because of that sonically this is a pretty chilling track as well there's something very fearful about the way this instrumental sounds and I liked it it was very nice change of mood overall this wasn't a bad LP it was decent I wouldn't say it was more exciting than movement it just felt like the more experimental tracks weren't really that attention-grabbing or awe-inspiring and the poppier songs just you know weren't really sticking with me and after a while just kind of became background music especially with how all those vocal layers blended together in such an unmemorable way but I will say Holly does take some risks with this record and if you're looking for a producer who has an interesting take on pop music on experimental music as well I think you're going to hear some interesting ideas on this record I'm feeling a decent strong six on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music review forever "},{"id":"DYjFU8zATdc","title":"This Routine Is Hell - Howl ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"wow that's good gonna work on that a little bit but it's coming together hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new this routine is hell album howl this is the latest full-length LP from this netherlands rock outfit recorded produced by kurt blue of converge fame a guy who must be one of my favorite producers of all time given that there are so many reviews in my back catalogue of albums that he produced and I would say on how Kurt strikes gold once again with these European up-and-comers now the band this routine as hell might not be extremely well known and it may seem as if Kurt Balu working with a guy of his stature would be a huge opportunity for them but this routine is how goes into this record pretty confident in their sound already back in 2010 the band dropped the full-length LP V Verve crusade which featured a lot of hardcore punk stylings slowed down to a slightly sludgy pace with some very heavy undertones but it's not like the band was particularly heavy production wise it's not like there was a lot of bass and Rumble in the mix the tone of the vocals were pretty average for hardcore but it was just the clarity and the passion and the directness of the lyrics that really sort of made the vocals stand out for me which in my opinion is a quality that I love so much about old old hardcore punk music where the lyricist really wanted to make a statement make a message on this LP this routine is held would occasionally speed things up like a hardcore band typically does but they would go on to their next EP repent repeat to indulge in a much heavier and sludgy er sound that was spring of last year and now with the album how will the band's sludge your side is in even fuller of effect but they still do maintain their hardcore punk style even as they're slowing things down a little bit more of course they still bring plenty of memorable readable and very message heavy lyrics and the end result on this LP is essentially 12 tracks and 20 minutes of some incredibly glass smashing bitter punk rock that I think fans of adrenaline pumping riffs and grooves and very fed up lyrics will enjoy this album kicks things off pretty well with one of the opening tracks on here in nostalgia which to be completely honest does have a riff a chord progression a groove and the pacing of the vocals on this track as well all of it reminds me of a recent track from the California hardcore punk band ceremony SiC it's really a dead ringer of course there are some small variations in the riff and this version is a lot heavier but I still can't help but love it the production on this track feels way thicker way more layered I'm loving the ominous guitar feedback as well and instead of a song about being sick very satirical e of a number of things this track is really a lyrical assault against nostalgia nostalgia burns us it does other things too according to the lyrics and there's just this impeccable energy even though the band isn't playing that quickly it almost feels as if they're playing very fast because of just how savage the energy is this track quickly segues into the next with a little bit of noise and I love that I love that this album really has a fantastic flow to it really it's just one song bleeding into the next and this happens in more ways than one - like the song shiver which really feels like an elongation of the previous track the title track from this LP howl now shiver is a slower track I wish it was a little bit more eventful though there is a great guitar solo on the end of this cut that just wails with passion as how progresses it just dishes out more and more tracks that feature essential grooves essential riffs which are backed up with some very interesting transitions and choruses really packed and condensed into songs that lasts about 40 seconds to two minutes like the song wrongdoer which has this just very stiff bashing intro riff which very quickly and suddenly transitions into the to this very sinister and gloomy guitar interlude and 3/4 overall in this LP I will say there are some unmemorable moments most notably the forty second long tracks which of course don't take a long time but still aren't that short in comparison with some of the other songs on this album I guess these songs don't really offer me anything to grab on to it's like they're here and they're gone without really putting out a riff or a melody that sticks in my head in their very short time span especially the untitled track on here which just is one short feedback piece still it's it's really the last portion of the cell P where I think this album gets incredibly solid the track I wait to see the world feels like a cinder block to the head it feels like a sidewalk faceplant with it's hard ass riffs and devilish melodies over the verses I think the song asleep has the same qualities as well I love the slow and sort of patient build of the song uncommon ground a lot of different parts to this track though I will say it does come off a bit more disjointed than some of the other songs on here still this song highlights to me was very important about this album and that's a lyrical theme it's a theme that many other tracks on here bring up through imagery of burning down towns breaking fingers from hands which at one time gave one a certain hand of cards anesthetize enjoy more than the ordinary there are just tons and tons of lyrics throughout this album which deal with not accepting what has just been handed to you and either fighting for or destroying what was given to you and trying to rebuild something better which in my opinion is a pretty strong and inspirational message even if it is expressed in a pretty angry way on this album overall I feel like this is a well written produced performed and pretty thrilling hardcore punk album with some strong lyrical themes there are some songs a few on here that pale in comparison to others but really I don't have many complaints at all I'm feeling a light a decent eight honest thing it's not exactly reinventing the wheel by do you think it's great if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Paris Hilton good job on the little Wayne song the national fans I'm sorry I'm sorry also Alicia bananas Edom and the city of Chicago whose school board voted to close 50 schools even Cal chest and all that not good only the strong subscribed all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan oh this routine is hell howl forever [Music] [Music]

transmission 0 in ghouls sort of fictional little world they are from a land called creep Sylvania but from what I understand they are actually from from Oakland Oh where's that well it's in California but if you ever go there make sure to protect your neck because if you don't you might get junked why do you think they call it troubling freaky yep that's where they're from these guys are a thrash metal band but they're one of the most personality driven thrash metal acts I've heard in a while Bell Bell Bell the vocals that they have going are done in a really a death metal style they have a very misfits esque horror movie fetish going on and ghoul also has this very theatrical over-the-top dramatic GWAR kind of shtick going for them to musically like I said these guys do play thrash but they've got this really lean straightforward crossover thrash thing gang vocals and fast paces and just and in-your-face aesthetic that I think fans of DRI or suicidal tendencies will be able to get into as well what also influences this bands music a little bit is is surf rock in a couple of tracks these guys actually managed to work in the drum beats bass lines and guitar leads that you would normally hear in a surf song but the thrash elements and the death metal vocals are still there it just doesn't clash in the way that I thought it would initially it becomes a part of Gul's sound and that sound ends up being kind of exciting and conflicting to me at the same time because I don't know whether to just get up and start mashing and elbowing thing or go on YouTube and start looking up old episodes of Tales from the Crypt now to bring the shtick that these guys have going for them even further the lyrics the songs on this album actually tell a story a very comic book-like story filled with cartoony gore that makes it about as fun to follow as like a toxic avenger film the story this record tells features the four members of the band going on this bloody and and horrifying adventure involving killer robots and and cannibalism and mind control and voodoo curses drugs and and cultists as well even though there are elements of punk on here thrash metal and death metal all very aggressive hard-hitting genres ghoul takes everything that is so grim about these styles of music so dark and and so serious and they make it pretty fun to me it's it's kind of light-hearted because you don't need to take it really seriously but ghouls respective members have toured with or played in plenty of metal bands who are taken really seriously like wolves in the throne room dystopia ludicrous under and the band impaled who actually think they share the most characteristics with now sound wise I really love this record I think it's got a lot to offer the drums just have this really nice punch to them the cymbals get a little lost in the background for me a bit but the guitars are really where a lot of this records guts come from they've got this nice heavy crunch to them that sounds fantastic it's sound kind of reminds me a little bit of that new toxic Holocaust record conjure and command so yeah I do think these guys improve their sound beyond their last record splatter thrash but they also refine themselves musically a bit too I think the music on this thing to me just feels less chaotic less messy the riffs have a lot of muscle to them and they're really catchy because these guys are hitting great grooves and even though these riffs are pretty hard-hitting I think a lot of them are evened out because these guys manage to cover them color them in some really nice solos and Lee as far as negatives on this album go there aren't a lot but some of the riffs some of the solos do sound a little generic kind of cliche if you're a thrash metal fan you've heard buildups leads and solos like this before so that makes some of the moments on here kind of a forgettable blur to me if it wasn't for the story the good production just the personality of this band I I wouldn't be riding with these songs as hard as I am right now and I'm sure for some people metalheads and non metal heads this record is gonna I don't know have a little too much Kitsch for you might be too silly for you I don't know and though it is an important part of the storyline I feel like the song morning of the mesma Tron is a little too long a little too drawn-out this eight minute monster among all these like two to three-minute thrash punk tunes with death metal vocals but overall if you're a metalhead I think this is going to be the most fun you're gonna have with a metal record this year and even if you're not huge on metal I still think this is worth trying even though these guys are really excessive they kind of do it in a pretty self-aware way which you know really hits home for me on the last track where one of the lyrics say spill your blood for rock and roll I'm loving the hell out of this thing feeling like a decent eight on this really fun enjoyable solid record with a good variety of different sounds on here that let me separate one tune from another pretty easily but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana cool "},{"id":"WX1qWv05ILU","title":"Chromeo - White Women ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the nuke Romeo record white women these guys are a pop duo of known for their vintage Flair embracing the sounds of disco synth funk New Wave Chromeo has been doing it for over 10 years at this point in my opinion they have a few decent records under their belt or at least the very good business casual to me that record and fancy footwork are loaded with just top-notch poppy sexy sensual pop songs that have top-notch production that feels modern but also has an extreme attention to detail when capturing a lot of these old-school cues from the errors of music that they are so obviously borrowing from the lyrics on chromia records are typically very flirty they're hyper sexual they're playful they're kind of lovestruck but chromeo usually does a good job of taking these themes and presenting them in a very silly tongue-in-cheek kind of self-aware way so I never quite feel like just totally rolling my eyes of what the band is doing and typically they never really let this silliness they never let this excessiveness overshadow their talents as producers and songwriters Chromeo can pull together some killer singles bonafide lovin and don't turn the lights on and night by night which i think is the duo's best song so I went into this new Chromeo LP excited for a few different reasons one the song jealous killer single - business casual is my favorite record of their so far so you know I'm only sitting here assuming that crumby is going to continue creating a streak here and just dish out another great LP and also on top of those two things disco synth funk these vintage pop sounds they're making a bit of a comeback right now and if any group out there is deserving of sitting a top of the wave this new neo synth new ultra new disco revitalization it is Chromeo they've been putting in work this stuff however I don't think that that's going to be happening on this record I do think there are some good songs here but nothing I hear that is going to be really a cross over hit for them breaking them outside of they're already pretty passionate fan base but chromeo definitely tries I mean this for them is a pretty star-studded record they bring quite a few notable guests into the tracklist on this thing I'm just not hearing a whole lot in terms of improvement in production quality and this is some of the worst chromeo songwriting I've heard in their four album discography now for the most part the guests they bring onto the sell piece seem to do a good job I mean Toro y Moi Solange Knowles ezra from Vampire Weekend ASAP ferg for whatever reason appears in the music video for jealous and like I said with jealous Chromeo does bring a great single to the table I love the funky slap bass line the dance beats the bright scents the hard groove and the song has one of the most addictive courses of 2014 in my opinion Hackett didn't is and the Tori muah feature on come alive goes over really well another great chorus on this LP and even though I'm not really the biggest Toro fan he fits in like huh bit of into ChromeOS sound good [Music] but outside of these tracks the highlights on this record while there are good moments they tend to run a little mild not ChromeOS most fiery material the track with Solange Knowles who sings really well during her appearance on lost on the way home then there is the song old 45s which to me lyrically is kind of like ChromeOS mission statement for their entire career where essentially you have the chorus saying that if you feel like romance is dead if you feel like romance is gone find an old jukebox with old 45s pop and nickel into it and this romance this love in music will come alive then there's hard to say no which has a great melody over the chorus and is a nice little piece of synth piano pop that I could hear Billy Joel pulling together back in the 80s then there's the very instrumentally lavish fall back to you which has these disco tinged string sections on the acta sound beautiful but there are so many tracks on this thing that of I cringe at for one frequent-flyer melodically and lyrically one of the worst chromium songs jet lag you must be tired watch out you might misfire anything your heart desires I want to take you higher one two three you and me can you move up my velocity and there's this Tina Turner style hey that pops it against this chorus and don't get me wrong Tina has great songs and her discography especially during that era in her career but it does not go over well on this record to me tracks like this are as in bad taste as chromeo gets and they failed to back these sounds up with a really good song this continues on the song sexy socialite which i think is another pretty cheap track from chromeo not only is the course slightly asinine on this track but I really don't get the sentiment of the song it seems like the narrator of the track is stalking this girl who is a sexy socialite who likes to party and have fun and drink and go crazy and public gatherings whatever and the narrator is just wishing either she was a different person or she would change or she would give him attention or he could just find a way to get her attention there's even a bad rap verse toward the end of this track delivered at a very snooty girl voice you know if she wants to party just whatever if she doesn't pay any attention to you you know who cares it's hardly a song subject and then there's the song over your shoulder which seems to be putting itself into this kind of weird white knight role when it comes to winning a woman's heart it's well intentioned but the results are not good essentially the song telling girls hey don't be self-conscious about your size and the shape your butt and your breasts don't be buying into this grass was greener mentality don't be looking over your shoulder at other women as if every woman on the planet is inherently jealous of the physicality of every other woman walking down the street he's trying to ease this woman's mind about her physical imperfections of sharing her about them but also switching these lines about getting this girl undressed or getting between this girl's thighs like hey don't be worried I still want to have sex with you which makes the the song feel kind of sleazy and disingenuous then there are other tracks on here like play the fool which just feel incredibly nondescript to me in the greater scheme of ChromeOS songs and moments like as resent allude while I love as Rizzo and it's a nice little piano piece it doesn't really add anything to the album to me as a whole it's just a bit of distracting filler from the fact that Chromeo has not drawn up some good songs this time around so instead we're just going to hit you with a celebrity guest of every album in ChromeOS discography this one is of the most questionable quality just a lot of corny lyrics at every turn weak melodies just alright production and just again some of ChromeOS most uninteresting songs yet I'm Fiona light to decent five on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino Chromeo forever "},{"id":"aqANxjB58wA","title":"Julia Holter - Loud City Song ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Giulia holter album loud city song first off just want to say I'm happy I'm back happy I'm doing reviews again for you guys I missed you I even missed Cal you're really hurry life missed me yes I did I missed you so much I even wrote a song just for you oh boy sing it I will I will well I didn't actually write a song you're an idiot I hate you so much Julia halter is a California singer songwriter she has several studio records under her belt this is the latest and she is a musician who I have been a little weary of because of her past work for a while because of how dreamy much of it tends to be and while that aesthetic isn't bad there wasn't much vocally or musically that was kind of stopping me in my tracks and making me say wow holy crap however this new LP of hers is a slight change of pace and enough of a change of pace to get me to say wow holy crap for the most part Julia's songs are still abstract slow burning ballads but the instrumentation on Cloud City song feels very very upfront Center tangible detailed yes their synthesizers on this LP yes there are vocals on this LP but these songs are also beautifully layered in these just tangible strings and horns making for a record that yes is is art pop yes is dream pop it has some characteristics of chamber music and a bit of jazz in here too I would actually say a bit of musical theater seems to seep through on the opening track to this thing world which features Julia halter singing these very dramatic lines which are delivered with this faint delicate singing style Julie being very subtle and tender on this track and she comes through with these kind of abstract lines tipping her hat two hats as well as misters and mothers cities this no named girl who is singing on the fifth floor of an apartment building which she later reveals to be herself she's asking herself questions like how can I escape you what am I looking for in you there's this great sense of longing that sort of permeates nearly every track on this album even as the music gets increasingly more bubbly bright cloudy blissful like the song maximum layout which has these very puffy string sections gently pulsating against these wailing strings that are just crying away in the background Julia comes through with her beautiful voice again on this track but is much more animated than on the previous song and brings through a little bit of whispered spoken word on this track as well which is a technique she uses at a few other points on this thing too for example the song in the green wild which for a good chunk of the song features just Julia kind of blending these elements of singing and talking against this very busy upright bass line it's kind of a fun captivating more playful side of Julia and on the flip side we have more spoken word right at the beginning of the track horns surrounding me which maybe isn't spoken word as much as it is just straight creepy with Julia recording herself or somebody else running from what sounds like horns through the woods whispering oh my god they're getting me it's kind of like the Blair Witch Project but like PLA re4 blaring horns music joke however this is one of the tracks that maybe I wasn't completely enamored with because Julia was getting drowned out a bit by the horn she is kind of a subtle singer however maybe that was kind of the point with the horns surrounding her because after all her voice does cut through the mists of instrumentation beautifully on the track hello stranger and this of course is a nice contrast from one of the more harder hitting songs on this LP maxims to which features these multi-tracked vocals from Julia in this tense rising instrumentation Julia does bring quite a bit of diversity to the table on this thing I am really impressed with the fact that she has these more animated tracks these songs that have more hard-hitting instrumentation just these really serene songs these beautiful songs these songs that are just more odd and kind of obtuse and off-putting and yet it all kind of has this thread of Beauty running throughout all of it toward the end of this LP Julia continues to deliver some pretty decent songs like he is running through my eyes which is a very beautiful piano ballad and this is a true heart is maybe the most bubbly fancy-free track on this entire LP it's kind of like a psychedelic dreamy prance romp around through Candyland however the last track on this thing highlights one of the major overall issues that I do have with this record record with so many of these songs and this album in general being so abstract in terms of structure or flow there are a lot of moments where I feel like these tracks come through with legit endings that feel like they deliver some kind of closure or some kind of cool-down point where I feel like the finish is coming the last track on this thing doesn't feel all too climactic or even really like a finisher for what themes and ideas are presented on loud city song for the most part lyrically it brings a lot of the same themes that were delivered on the opening track here maybe it's a bit of a reprieve I guess this LP doesn't really end with a significant change because so much of what's here is based upon Julia's surroundings and and those haven't changed by the end of the album or at least that's what it feels like this LP is is really more of a space that can be wandered through as opposed to some kind of urgent tale that has a beginning and a middle and an end which is pretty interesting considering how much pop music influences this album and that's typically the mentality that that flows through that kind of music overall to me the mood the style the production the singing the songwriting and melodies on this thing incredibly solid very enjoyable occasionally Julia does come off very Kate bushy really kind of wears her influences on those sleeves but it doesn't ruin the experience for me because I think she's come together with a solid record that she could call her own I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing but what do you think do you love loud city song do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next only the strong subscribe all mistakes or intentional Anthony Fantana Julia halter lad city song

new OneNote Rick's point never album age of this is the latest full-length album from electronic and experimental music producer Daniel laputan aka OneNote Rick's point never a guy who thus far has had one of the most versatile careers of any artist cut from his cloth covering the basis of drone and progressive electronic music ambient post-industrial glitch plunder phonics and that's just under the 106 point never named we're not even getting into his electronic improvisational stuff or his vaporwave material recently under the OPI name daniel has dropped some pretty cutting-edge music replicas garden of delete r+ 7 the last of which there's is maybe my least favorite of the three but I see why the fans love it he's pretty much been on a streak lately so there's really no reason not to go into this new album over here excited especially with this incredibly odd album cover there was also a lead single from this album titled black snow which didn't blow me away but nevertheless I found intriguing it was a really strange mix of MIDI music and new-age and art pop featured a kind of rare lead vocal very naked lead vocal from Daniel himself and as to be expected because of this track but also because Daniel tends to reinvent himself with each new release he does break at least a little new ground for himself on this record as some of the songs on this thing features some pretty prominent lead vocals as well as like I said the whole new age thing some classical undertones get worked in occasionally as well especially on the incredibly gorgeous and regal introductory track but overall a lot of the tracks on this thing kind of make me think this is music that I would hear if I were to attend like a cult meeting for a particular cult whose whose message was a super futuristic and utopian as a lot of the compositions and instrumentation on this thing has a very synthetic glossy and idyllic vibe which Daniel occasionally undercuts with some weird compositional twists and turns or warped instrumentation or distortion glitches intentionally messing with some of the images of perfection and annotation that I think a lot of the music on this record brings and I like that characteristic I think it's a cool idea however I fail to see Daniel following all the way through with it from beginning to end on this album truth be told I think this is one of his most inconsistent albums in a while not only that but some of the ideas on this thing sort of sound like an idealistic and a cult take on some of the sounds that he had drummed up on his previous record garden of delete which the station is kind of a prime example of the plucky and hypnotic MIDI guitars on this track are pretty refreshing but the heavily processed lead vocals on this track sound like again something that could have been on garden of delete the compositional style is eerily familiar as well and then there's that weird instrumental shift in the back end of this track that features some melting synth layers that could have been worked into his last major release in the ambient genre or eternal but that's the other thing with this record more than any other OPN album in recent memory this is very much in everything but the kitchen sink album because you have moments on this thing like Babylon which is a painfully awkward futuristic art pop track with downright dreadful and boring lead vocals encased in these way too washed out since this exists on the same album as the dark industrial and percussive we'll take it and it's not like the flow from one track to the next between these two songs is that logical either this album is littered with 1-minute detours vocal appearances from the likes of an Oni and korean twitch while they're good they do kind of inadvertently add to the lack of cohesion among these tracks I mean there's futuristic pop on this thing apocalyptic post-industrial moody MIDI jazz all of which kind of break up the vaguely new-age aesthetic that quite a few tracks on this thing bring I mean they're highlights on here but I just failed to see how it all ties together the tracks on this thing feel even more disconnected from one another than the material on replicas which is crazy considering just how wide and varied the source material Daniel sampled on that record was I also think our plus seven is a more cohesive record - despite the point of that album being to create these separate sonic objects with each song at least all the tracks on that album shared a similarly abstract aesthetic age' doesn't seem had much of a clear progression or focal point it's more like potpourri and as a result even though there are good tracks on this release they don't really build on one another all that well still I do enjoy tracks on this thing such as toys - which features this strangely beautiful and inspiring lead synth melody whose Tam bird is is a lot like that of I don't know an alien reed instrument all of these are being supported by these epic and ascending keyboard arpeggios and glitchy percussion it sounds like a piece of music from a movie score where humans are embroiled in an ongoing war with like an alien species and one person breaks from the culture of hate to reach across enemy lines and befriend the aliens and understand their culture and realize that they're just sentient beings with wants and desires and needs much like ourselves directed by James Cameron eventually the music on this track shifts into the kind of disjointed sense escapes that I loved so much on Daniels replica record but with a softer and more futuristic edge I also enjoy the song warning quite a bit - which has these tense eerie staccato synthesizers eventually the tension of these scents builds up into a really abrasive vocal appearance from Dominic Fernau aka per ant the track is short but unsettling and twisted the song shame featuring some vocals from an Oni has some absolutely insane vocal layering it's the kind of sampling and twisted sound play I typically expect out of like an orange milk records release but the instrumental density of this track is almost like on an orchestral level not only that but the song is kind of finished off with this high-gloss new-age finish there are some abrasive shots of noise in the mix too as well as psychedelic delays this track for me is like peak cult vibes on the album it's like listening to a religious chant I also love the song ray Katz which is this incredibly gorgeous and complex MIDI string piece it is a wonderfully dynamic and sprawling piece which I think goes to show just how much daniel's sound design abilities have advanced in the past five years it's just unfortunate that he's showcasing this talent on one of his least consistent albums in a while the songs still stuff that doesn't happen also features a note knee and sounds like a moody mix of MIDI electronics art pop and jazz all set in the waiting room for purgatory in the year 3000 and then the closing track the last known image of a song really lives up to its title and that it feels like more of an impression of a song than an actual song it feels almost like Daniel is taking a replica esque approach to this track in that he may be composing a song and then chopping that track up sampling it and then putting like a new-age jazz finish on it personally I think there are a lot of interesting highlights on this album these sounds on this thing are vivid luscious gorgeous it's like abstract ear candy at its highest points I think Daniels sound crafty and Composition efforts for the most part are pretty good on here too but I still can't help but feel like the overall lack of focus cohesion as well as some of the more vocal led tracks on this thing going over like gangbusters these things are really kind of holding age of back from its true potential I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given age of a

Kozelek ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"Oh Panera theny brevet Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled Mark kozilek album this is the latest full-length album from the singer-songwriter Mark kozilek the mastermind of I guess his own solo efforts the red house painters as well as Sun Kil moon and artist whose work I've covered on this channel numerous times an artist who had an incredibly prolific 20:17 as well dropping a Sun Kil moon record multiple collaborative albums keep in mind that Sun Kil moon record common is light in love our red valleys of blood was kind of a two-hour opus if 2017 marked anything for Mark it was this trend toward artistic indulgence which for me led to some incredible highs and a few head-scratching lows it feels kind of weird to think that just four years ago mark was delivering this perfected balance of balladry and storytelling on one of his biggest and most critically acclaimed records to date Benjy which is probably a sound he could have stuck with for quite a while but instead mark decided to change decided to evolve and in that process begin to hone in on one of the most singularly peculiar characteristics of his songwriting and of course I'm talking about the incredibly detailed wordy and dense lyrics that mark typically works into his tracks with a series of fourth wall breaks and narrative detours and internal monologues mark seemed to strike upon a uniquely meta brand of songwriting through albums like comedies light and universal themes and his collaborative his first collaborative album with Yaesu and his new self-titled LP over here seems to be the next phase in that evolution featuring mark recording songs on mobile recording gear in one hotel after another armed with nothing but his voice and acoustic or electric guitar which leads to a very intimate low-key subtly lo-fi recording which will most likely land the hardest with mark's hardcore fans and and maybe not amount to much for those who don't really see much in the cult of personality of his records or don't really see the point to his end diatribe songwriting style maybe it's not as much songwriting as it is song rambling now I personally enjoy what mark is doing on this record but I feel like part of the reason for that is is that have been riding with him for a little while now I mean I haven't been crazy about everything mark has been doing over the past few years but listening to this record kind of feels like cracking open the seventh installment of a very dense ongoing mystery book series and while this self-titled albums 90-minute run is shorter than that of common as light it still feels like more of a challenge to listen to and not in a particularly bad way just more in an artistic aesthetic way because right up front the songs here are not particularly catchy the instrumentation given that it's mostly just guitar and voice played at a very low volume because mark was trying to keep - you know the the requirement of being at a low volume in a hotel room so again instrumentation is pretty light on the ears not really super gripping or punchy or bright or aggressive the gentle and repetitive guitar phrasing along with Mark's very mumbly and forlorn voice is kind of a an ambient effect after a while and as far as the narratives on this album go they really are more meta and rambley and tangential than ever now if you've been listening to Mark's a recent output the lyrical themes on this record should be nothing new his music movies he likes and movie references aging mortality tragedies and mass shootings legendary sports figures musicians who he admires or food or weird personal interactions but despite my familiarity with Mark's stories at this point and his inability to ever filter himself I still think on this album he has quite a lot of interesting things to sing and say whether it's on the mark kozilek museum which is one of the most autobiographical and I think introspective tracks he's ever dropped so far it's a song sung over these very twinkly and meditative electric guitar arpeggios and with like a lot of cuts on here you have a lot of shifts in the chord progression or sounds like maybe even the key to something major or minor depending on the mood or the darkness or the levity of a particular lyrical passage singing about finding a location for this made-up Museum singing about being younger trying to get a start in the music business and people kind of patronizing him like yeah sure mark you're gonna make a yeah sure you're gonna be a famous singer describing his love of aerial pink and a music festival saying that if they had started in the 70s Arial would be David Bowie famous and he would be Neil Young famous saying that you could say a lot of things about both of them but you could never really call them boring and immediately after that mark breaks into this refrain of repeating the word diarrhea over and over again which is not just random it's a referral back to a moment where he talks about how the Porta Potty is at the festival smelled Marc even goes as far as to narrate his own guitar solo and and talk about what inspired it that was just a supremely surreal moment for me on the album like the lengths at which Mark will go to basically tell a story about anything the song my love for you is undying is another one of the longest tracks on this album surpassing ten minutes and actually is has quickly become one of my favorite mark kozilek songs to date if not only for its really weary hypnotic guitar leads that are cut into both the left and right channels and there are a lot of things that mark says on this song a couple of stories but really the highlight for me in this track is in the last leg where he kind of details this interaction that he had with this girl which was pretty negative and very weird at what he described as like a smelly old liberal vegan bookstore at one point in the story he even cracks up which I mean it is a really funny story it's kind of hard to imagine how he kept up the forlorn vocal delivery for so long while singing it live in Chicago might be one of the more difficult tracks to swallow for some fans because it's just so internal it's just so obsessed with minor details and just this really slow hyper descriptive diary like writing style but I still love the devoted descriptions that mark gives in this track in the lead up to a performance that he had in Chicago talking about his dry cough the food that he's getting calling his girlfriend and shadowboxing thoughts of the recent Las Vegas shooting and Tom Petty passing kind of inhabiting his mind inspiring particular tributes during that night show the instrumental is strangely sharp in pitchy features some very odd guitar phrasing but I feel like the track is almost relaxed or brought to a bit of an equilibrium by the very soft bum bum ba ba background vocals that mark provides throughout much of the song the opener to this record this is my town has its themes rooted pretty deeply in origins mark singing about how this is his town and all the things that make it his town and the other great people that came from his town Mart also singing about how this well you're hearing is his sound on this particular track the instrumental features these really hypnotic and plucky harmonic guitar leads on the surface it sounds very light and simplistic but it's layered in a really beautiful in a kind of complex way sometimes I don't feel like I'm listening to a song or a composition as much as I'm listening to sound bed for mark to kind of platform himself on top of and tell these stories much in the same way I kind of felt about that recent Alan Vega album it except that's like an experimental like synth punky noise album and and this is so much more ambient by comparison but even though they're very aesthetically different I feel like both artists make some similar compositional choices in order to create the the instrumental spaces in which they say their piece I also love the really surreal and sublime weed-whacker which features this really warm and welcoming and slightly twangy guitar phrasing it's an odd track where mark is narrating about him and his actions but as if he is outside of himself he's referring to himself in the third person but it's pretty clear that all the sections of this track kind of add up in such a way where it's portraying mark in a particular headspace or a particular mood where he doesn't seem very focused on his art on his song craft not really being dogged by his own sense of celebrity he's just a guy who is buying property he's a guy who's weed-whacking doing like lawn maintenance going to a coffee shop just having a random interaction with a random guy but then he's hit with like oh what's the sound of this music who's this guy rapping on the stereo and the guy says oh you know that Sun Kil moon we're listening to it on Spotify Spotify kind of being this album's Panera Bread as it is the the one major cultural force that for whatever reason on this album is is name-dropped and repeated multiple times generally I just like the portrait that the song paints of mark just of this guy who is on the cusp of retiring and is just completely outside of this world of live performances and I'm writing this song and I'm hanging out with this musician and I'm thinking about this thing that just happened in the news the twangy dark and eerie electric guitars that inhabit the song sublime kinda remind me a really old-school modest mouse there's also a superlight snare drum on the track which is a as subtle as it is a giant change of pace to have some legit percussion on the song now the narrative on this track that was easily one of the most rambley on the entire record but that's something that mark acknowledges really in the midst of the track with him essentially acknowledging that he ran out of words in the midst of writing the track adding to that that's how I work I don't stick around with nothing long now I got a borrow a line from Tupac to keep things moving along he said we don't have the motherfucking luxury to spend this much motherfucking time on this one motherfucking song which could be a part of his usual artistic process but also I think that could be inspired by the fact that he was writing and recording under weird circumstances with limited instrumentation in these hotel rooms so maybe he was kind of giving himself a limitation there to finish these tracks within a certain amount of time but again given how rambley this track is I do think the last leg of this particular cut is is noticeably weaker than a lot of the songs that have come so far and that's the thing as this album plods along like after the middle point I can kind of feel that even though marks words are pretty rambly that there was at least a kind of a sense of what exactly he was going for even if it was a little vague on tracks like this on tracks like good nostalgia seems so much less apparent nostalgia being a track that I really owe the aesthetic of this song has a guitar tone and sound that's incredibly reverb II haunting strange unlike that of any other cut on the record but the lyrics and the tune and the structure itself just doesn't really leave much of an impression on me even with it being one of the shorter and one of the more brief tracks on the record you'd figure with a more condensed runtime it would be a bit punchier because the longer tracks as long as they have more focus they actually have more impact nostalgia though just kind of felt like Marc was flipping through a series of surreal David Lynch esque dream states which is even more so the case on 666 posts but maybe to the point where it actually kind of makes the song pretty unique the guitar sound a little bit darker Marc singing is much more unsteady and sped up and tense and just feels very anxious he goes into very intimate detail of kind of waking up in spaces maybe after a performance or something and not knowing where he is not knowing what he has to do feeling jet-lagged not really feeling attached or connected to any one place because he's constantly going he's constantly moving going into details with particular dreams that he's having while he's out and about and also making like he's really weird mouth noises of some of the things that are either around him or in his dreams like cable cars and pets now the final moments of the record is where I think things really start to go south a little bit the banjo song for me is one of the most obnoxiously meta on the entire album yes even with moments on here where Marc is singing about hey am i singing or am i talking what do you think about these words I'm singing this right now I'm thinking this right now in a way I feel like he's kind of not just breaking down the fourth wall but busting through it like the kool-aid man as he's singing about this being his banjo song but it doesn't have a banjo on it and the guitar on it is a Yamaha I mean as much as I enjoy some of the diatribes in this track about buffalo wings and one of Marc's friends getting a really awful stomach bug it's at this point where the lack of cohesion among the the various passages lyrical passages in these tracks really kind of unravels the potential appeal of them though my least favorite track on the album has to be young Riddick Bowe and not necessarily for any narrative elements of the cut really more of the sound of the song kind of irks me the heavily layered and somewhat aggressive nylon string guitars combined with Marc's very strained and somewhat yell P vocals for the entirety of the track they just really kind of wear on me after a little while especially since Marc's singing or talking or whatever you want to call it on this song has very little in the way of rhythm or rhyme or meter it just literally sounds like he's rambling as much as he can over this very unpleasant guitar instrumental I love that mark sort of over packs his songs with particularly Racal details but I can't even really say that I find the lyrics on this song really gripping here it literally just feels like what he's saying is just really unkempt like there just wasn't as much direction the writing process of this song as much as there was in previous tracks even with using boxing figure young Riddick Bowe is a bit of an anchor to start with and come back to later in the song the closer on this record is decent starts off with some very heartfelt and wonderful guitar chords that are actually pretty striking ones that I wish carried throughout much of the track but really only last for the first leg mark says some pretty compelling stuff about his father potentially passing away missing him his girlfriend his relationship with her he closes the words of the album talking about how the album is over you know again staying incredibly meta but the stuttering guitar arpeggiated entually transition and very quickly after these guitar chords that I absolutely love kind of pack much of the rest of the track out and I don't know just kind of sound like these stuttering guitar riff had used that you would find on any number of tracks prior to this one I guess instrumentally I wish that mark took things in a bit of a dip direction and just did more to prevent redundancy on this album because as specific as this brand of songwriting is to mark toward the end I kind of feel like he was stretching the appeal of it a little thin still though I do think this is a relatively solid record an interesting singer-songwriter release although maybe not one I would recommend right away to somebody who isn't familiar with marks past work but if you're up for the challenge and you want to hear something that's kind of ambient really wordy super thought-provoking incredibly personal painfully intimate then I recommend that you try this album out I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen

REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hey everyone Kissimmee hit is Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Janelle Monae album dirty computer this is the latest full-length album from songwriter singer rapper producer model actress Janelle Monae this is her third full-length commercial album it follows 2013's Electric Lady an album of somewhat conceptual pops soul revisiting a lot of the themes of futurism and cybernetics and love and femininity as well as afro centrosome expressed on her previous efforts but this time around with a somewhat poppier veneer that in my opinion kind of undercut the grand epic ambitious R&B experience presented on previous efforts like the arc android in a way it just kind of sounded like a less epic version of what i've heard already those still good still decent but afterwards it seemed like Chanel was doing even more to kind of undercut the artsy er side of her appeal and attempting to raise the visibility of her Wonderland Records label by dropping some of the cheapest pop rap singles I've heard this decade like Joo Deniz classic man as well as her own yoga track nigh that neither which I care for all that much but you know I get it for Monet for Wonderland records it seems like things are a bit of a tightrope walk they clearly want to make music and art that's forward-thinking cutting-edge stylish and artful but the mainstream audiences out there might not get it but there's also clearly a focus on making things coming out of Wonderland records have a pop appeal as well so that one tool and and and Janelle Monae are successful commercially I'm sure it's also important to them that they have a platform from which they can release tracks like hell you Tom about a protest song the Jenelle and company released in 2015 speaking out against police brutality and in comparison with everything Monet has put out up until this point dirty computer I think is an even more focused attempt and making something that is equal parts pop and progressive not only that but this record is also her first release since blowing up networks outside of this metropolis suite that she's been guiding fans through all these years now of course because of that the narrative on this record is different than that of what you would naturally find on previous janelle monae albums the themes are a bit more contemporary a bit more reflective of present times our current social climate there's a lot more personal storytelling I think on this record as well which is an interesting change of pace because it's rare that in Monet's music we get a glimpse of what she was like when she was younger or what her thoughts are as a struggling artist or I guess what her political opinions are at least directly from her as a person as an artist not through a character that she's envisioned or anything also throughout this record deeply intertwined themes of sex power and politics hence the name of this record dirty computer because computers technology nothing new for Monet and her music but dirty this is this is a very sexy album now the musical flavors on this record will be familiar to fans of Monet's previous works elements of contemporary R&B as well as funk and pop and soul but I think some of these elements are a bit cooler than they've been in the past maybe brought to the backburner just a tad because there's like this very crisp synthetic production style on this record which did turn me off a little bit at first because sometimes the percussion feels like it's a little bit too indebted to the pop trap trends of 2018 in the search to find a sound on this record that is both pop and progressive it does lead to a few low points on the album in my opinion the politics on this record because the songs have to be direct and they have to be catchy can kind of be reduced down to sloganeering sometimes if you grab my pussy my pussy grabbed you back that sort of thing occasionally the production does feel a little thin a little sterile I do wish it was a little bit more organic at points and occasionally because there are themes of bliss and partying and feeling good on this record as well sometimes the lyrics do come off a bit vapid as well as more hedonistic than they are thoughtful I think the song crazy classic life is a prime example of most of these things though I do love the subtle nods to eighties synth pop on the instrumental though the sense the drums some of the vocal work on this track and the closer as well are both clear nods to prints still even though there are elements of this track I don't care for all that much I do sense that there is a message behind how blissful and uplifting and positive this track is it's like it's trying to be hopeful in the face of very dark times especially since the song does seem to kick off with this theme of the suit of happiness the feel of this song has a very carefree vibe but it's communicated pretty clearly in the lyrics that that is not the reality that the song comes from it's merely an aspiration that genell would like for the world at large for things just be less tumultuous when the record really gets going for me personally is on the song take a bite the song is glossy it's groovy it's tempting it's sexual it's an irresistible blend of pop and funk the beat the bassline the shimmering rhythm guitars Monet's beckoning vocals on the chorus take by God this track is juicy it's nice and juicy and that random-access memory not on the lyrics here you know it's remember it's it's dirty it's computer it's dirty computer the album gets even sweeter musically on the next song screwed but at the same time darker lyrically because throughout the song screwed or rather sex is being used as a tool to control people or a metaphor for people and the world at large just being fucked or just something to do because you know it feels good at first I wasn't too crazy about the track because it didn't feel like it was saying all that much but that's because the pop the near of the song is just so convincing it feels almost like a more tasteful approach to some of the pop rock tracks that Gwen Stefani was dropping in the 2000s it's bubbly it's tantalizing and yet also foreboding and zoe kravitz vocals on the track actually bring the song really sweet kind of girlish flare and this track isn't the only spot on the record where I feel this influence popping up it's also on the song I got the juice which feels like a cross section between tropical music Gwen Stefani's hollaback girl and kelis 'as milkshake but like with a fine arts degree now of course the common thread running through all of these songs is Pharrell who is also on this track he's got a verse on here he had a hand in the production so he just keeps making the same song over and over but it's still actually pretty good another time and I find this track to be less gimmicky than the two previously mentioned songs also Pharrell's verse on this track is hilarious it's sharp it's clever but also a little gross like that one line but he's talking about the juice Allah it's it's yellow like there's pee in it but yellow is is Pharrell's trademark color and I pee he means him pee Pharrell I mean what else I could say about the track is I don't know I mean if I got into how this song makes me feel I had I'd literally start breaking a sweat I get all hot and bothered on it have to cut this review off it really is that sexy if you kind of let the animalistic raw just lustful feelings of the song just take hold but outside of that I love Monet's very shouty sassy Colin response vocals the meticulously placed percussion now to go back to the song screw transitioning out of that track very nicely is Django Jane which I already praised pretty heavily when it was released as an earlier single it's a declaratory moody rap track where Monet essentially builds up her image as a one-of-a-kind artist a lot of themes of female empowerment throughout the track - I love that one line that's just like damn that's a bar over she talks about having to start a Pussy Riot she's gonna have to put them on a pussy diet was that was a good one the song pink is another great single that T's toward the release of this album a fantastic team-up not the first one though between her and Canadian pop artist Grimes the song brings a really summery feel-good blissful blend of pop and rock kind of an unusual sound for Monet it's just a little too bubbly a little too bright not typically something you hear her on the song sounds a lot like a Grimes track which I think is exactly why she had invited Grimes on to it but despite the fact that this track is a little unusual for Monet she pulls it off the song is easily one of the smarter and catchy or female empowerment anthems of the decade and I think a lot of people listening to it aren't quite appreciating just how cheeky the song is especially when you get down to the descriptions of the colors of the insides down there the song is really dynamic and really feminine as well I mean it's very pretty it's very gentle it's very tender yet also loud and powerful and authoritative the song make me feel was really the first single from this record that I truly fell in love with it's another moment on the album that is deeply inspired by prints the percussion the sense on this track feel almost like they're like a revision like a reversal or some kind of reimagine take on Prince's kiss it's like a lot of elements from that track have been transferred over onto this one and updated for the Millennial audience also I love Monet's lyrics on this track just the themes of attraction on this song are wonderful gorgeous Oh God in that music video so hot it's such the song I like that was the first single from the record that I felt just kind of on the fence with and even now listening to it in the context of the record I'm not all that crazy about it while I do like Monet lyrically going back into her past and celebrating this idea of individuality and kind of what makes her her own person and even though that makes her a bit of an outsider kind of weird not accepted by everyone celebrating that I still think the instrumental on this song just kind of sounds like your generic run-of-the-mill trap be definitely not an instrumental that to me feels as vibrant or as interesting or as intricate or as flavorful as many of the other instrumentals here not an instrumental which if I had heard it on its own I thought you know who would sound great on this oh my god Monet would sound great on this between her leads and the harmonies on this track she does put quite a bit of vocal work into it so it's not that bare of a song but it's still vastly overshadowed by a number of other tracks here I mean even some of the quieter ones like don't judge me which is this very slow psychedelic pop ballad on the surface the song reads like a story of not being able to be yourself around your significant other or being afraid that if you are yourself around your significant other that they're going to judge you and the only reason they have feelings for you is that they're in love with a character something that's not the real you the instrumentation on the track is settled but very flavorful these dreamy synthesizers some very nice guitar work a steady bass line and drum be the song so afraid is another track on the album that is not one of the more harder hitting but it does bring an interesting message and a blend of sounds there's like a very crunchy dejected set of guitar chords at the start of the song Monet is singing in a kind of angsty tone it actually sounds like the intro of a Nirvana song after this point in the track I was kind of expecting her in the band to go into like full grunge mode but it eventually blossoms into this epic heavenly soulful panoramic blend of instrumentation and vocals with Monet singing out passionately about how she's so afraid and while it may seem like again on the surface hey this is another love song it's another relationship song it all kind of comes back around on the closing track Americans where it becomes painfully clear that the really ship that she's referencing on those two tracks as well as maybe other tracks on this record is a relationship with her own country the song Americans has an amazingly hype 80s synth-pop vibe on it I get a bit of prints on this track I even get like a touch of Wham and the song is an all-inclusive call to everyone getting ground through the gears of the system in America to come together and fight for a better country that's women and blacks and Latinos members of the LGBTQ community poor white people I do find the track really inspiring really catchy very sweet though again I do think it does become another example on this album of some of the politics being reduced down to mere sloganeering a little bit which as I've said before in previous videos is one of the inherent problems with trying to make a pop record political because politics are so complex pop music and pop art is so straightforward it's so simplistic still though I enjoy a great deal of the songs on this record I think the production is pretty good the performances are nice and I think Monet mostly gets to where she's trying to go when it comes to the lyrical themes - I'm not gonna say this album is dumb because it's not it's far from a dumb album but I feel like Monet is smarter than the way she puts things on this record and I'm sure she understands that I mean it's only to this album's benefit that she didn't try to awkwardly preach herself through every single song on here and focused on making sure that at the end of the day the songs sounded good not just that they conveyed a message that she felt passionate about because his pop friendly as this album sounds it was definitely a risk to try to make a pop album that in a way was was smart more thoughtful and smarter than your average pop record I'm feeling a light too decent 8 on this album

time for an album review rather that's lp4 rata that is ADC electronic music duo and this is clearly their fourth album and on the surface I really can't say this LP is that out of step with rather that's previous efforts you got around 40 minutes of music here a dozen tracks and all of them are pretty much instrumental all the sounds that we've come to know and come to love from these guys around this LP to the really dry very rigid percussion lush synthesizers undeniable grooves and plus a sound that has pretty much become a trademark of these guys some very tinny harmonized guitar soloing that just slithers all over the music just coiling itself around the beats and the melodies as if it's making the music its next meal and what makes LP for interesting is that it continues down the path that the duo set on LP 3 where they're experimenting with different musical styles and different genres I can tell you right now on this LP even after a first listen I hear elements of Hawaiian music Middle Eastern music hip-hop neoclassical music as well well the duo pretty much sticks to the electronic grind on this album but still each track has a certain spice that gives it a different flavor from the next the instrumentation to is really something that I could just pour over for days a lot of lot of beautiful beautiful you want to cry string arrangements around this album that don't sound flat at all of course horns are in the mix mandolin acoustic guitar of course the usual percussion bass drums and the synth tones that these guys come up with are something that I couldn't even begin to describe they're like the Willy Wonka's of sound there are just so many sweet Sonic's just all in one place and I think it's really great that the sound set has has widened for a dad I mean we all love and know that tinnie harmonized guitar solos sound but because they have more at their disposal in terms of things that they can write songs with they don't rely on that all the time it's much more of a balanced sound that guitar currently gets it's fair amount of play but it's nice to hear rather than experimenting with other instrumentation the structures get a little bit more ambitious too rather that really isn't afraid to slow things down and take their time with a lot of these tracks favoring building and a lot of variation - I've enjoyed my share of songs off of classics or LP one but the amount of shifts each song goes through on LP pd4 mix rather that's earlier work seem just a little bit monotonous plus the production quality is just a lot better - I mean this album is just twelve nails into the coffin of radda that's older slightly rar sound there is a level of predictability on LP four even if you've only heard one rat-a-tat album or just several of their songs and I think a lot of critics are gonna dislike that predictability a lot of music fans are gonna dislike that predictability and rightly so to an extent we're obviously going to favor those earlier albums simply because that's when the sound the Ratatat sound first hit us and it was like wow and now we're sort of just listening to the duo two different variations of that same style but you know I don't know if I really need Ratatat to change the world for me to be quite honest I just want some sick-ass tracks that are gonna make my booty shake and that's what this does I feel like the tracks are fantastic if you're gonna go back and compare to their earlier stuff and be like yeah well you know it's not all that significant of a change I suppose you could make that argument I have to agree with you I'm not saying you people are wrong however that's not really affecting how much I'm enjoying this album for some reason I don't know but if you've heard this LP let

multi-instrumentalist producer and musical eccentric who came up in the 90s with a pretty diverse sound on hit records such as mellow gold and odelay these albums essentially being mishmash 'as of alternative rock funk hip hop and low fine music as well and Beck's entire discography reflects that very same diversity as well from the really oddball musical experiments and the strange tape recordings on stereo cat soul manure to the very freaky funk on the album midnight vultures and then there's the Freak Fulke record one foot in the grave personally my favorite of Beck's then there's the really odd poppy appeal of his biggest records and then there's the information and yarrow albums that take the sound of Beck's nineties output but give it a slightly more electronic edge on a lot of the tracks and then there's the very funky singer/songwriter esque tone down and somber sounds that come through on albums like mutations and sea change and with all these shifts and sound and style and mood of course there are some personal low points and high points for me throughout Beck's discography I personally have always been more of a fan of Beck's poppier side of his more eccentric and freaky side not so much the syrupy slo-mo sad songs that make up a majority of a few of his records however this era and Beck's career is a favorite for a lot of people and I get it sometimes songs in that mood are just what you want to hear and on top of it I think Beck's voice is very deep voice lends itself to this kind of songwriting a lot of people do consider records like sea change to be one of his best and the record is definitely his biggest success when it comes to making music in that gloomy er funkier style and now with this newest record of his Beck is revisiting that sound with what I've been told is kind of the companion record to that record and going into this LP part of me is psyched because of course this could be an opportunity for this side of Beck's persona to finally click with me and unfortunately once again that was just not the case while sea change and mutations a lot of the time don't really move me emotionally I do see the appeal in those records and it just wouldn't feel right to me to call those albums bland or uninteresting however those descriptions somehow feel right when it comes to me talking about this morning phase is essentially the equivalent to waking up after a long nights sleep and quickly realizing that absolutely nothing cool is going to happen today that's pretty much the tone the album sets on its forty second introduction which has all these very turgid overinflated string sections kicking off the album that while they do feel really huge and lavish there's absolutely no emotion to be pulled from them at all they may sound pretty in theory but they're a little too reserved to convey much of anything and to me that is many of the songs on this record in a nutshell I think Beck and I think these tracks overall are just a little too concerned with their own sense of bliss to actually pull off anything worth remembering even on one of the lead singles from this LP blue moon which I think is one of the most underwhelming tracks on this LP Beck starts singing I'm so tired of beard alone and it just comes off so melodramatic just pulling for something that's that's not there this track and many others on here just emotionally gutless and and compositionally when it comes to the melodies as well as the chord progressions and the rhythms the songs on this record feel so incredibly basic and yeah for sure the aesthetic is intentional Beck is not trying to make any kind of sudden loud or shocking moves on this record because it would not be in line with the blissful and very soft and easygoing tone however with its softness with its blissful Ness I don't think this record is that so duck - it's not that intoxicating either so because Beck is trying to keep things simple a lot of the time he does not build on this very basic foundational instrumentation rarely does the instrumentation on this record feel tangible or meaty because for the most part the inoffensive sounds of reverb and Moaning vocals are pretty much what's on the menu occasionally on these tracks there is a bit of a stylistic shift with some of these songs showing off a bit of a 60s psychedelic pop vibe like on the track blackbird chain and the song wave was one of the few tracks here that actually gripped me because it had this very huge minor tone orchestral string section hanging in the background it was easily one of the darker tracks on this entire record the strings on this track really make this thing a highlight on the entire LP and occasionally there is a drum beat or a guitar part that just feels a shade sharper than usual on the song sort of like on the track say goodbye but because a lot of the instrumentation tries to take such a simple approach what's being played feels kind of cliche because the chord progressions the very basic melodies not that I think they're directly ripping off any one track but because they're so simple in their approach they kind of sound like everything the song turn away which in comparison with the other tracks has just these driving finger pick guitars is actually a bit of a saving grace on this LP and actually gives one of these songs of pulse whereas most of the other songs on this thing are flatlining still I love the eerie lead guitar melodies on this thing the vocal melodies are great as well the tight vocal harmonies are nice to me this track reminds me of like a Fleetwood Mac song or something but with a much darker tone and there's a really detailed melodic progression that sits through two of the verses on this track in the first half it really is a song that I love and the only song that I loved on this entire record but the thing is a lot of Beck's fans and Beck as well obviously feel that there is something to playing songs this speed with this level of sparseness and I've been seeing it get rave reviews as well and it's just I don't know either flying over me flying under me it's just not hitting me at all I'm feeling a strong three to light four on this thing transition if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and where does this album sit in your ranking of your favorite BEC records let me know also are you a banana man I'm a banana man Beck morning phase forever "},{"id":"tTt7YDzH054","title":"Blur - The Magic Whip ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"I got in here cuz it didn't deal with the daemon I mean in the olden Amon hmm so I've got a deal with the daemon hi everyone family man tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new floor record the magical of a magic pipe blur one of the most recognized alt rock and Britpop bands of the 90s but a band that has been mostly inactive for the past decade or so the band is at the point now where their older records their best they're bigger records are starting to you know get some historical ground in the greater rock music canon so it's easy to see that blur is you know sort of due for a comeback but I have to admit that blurs come back here is not really one that I have been hotly anticipating for one the band was active only up until the early 2000s it's not like it was a lifetime ago and when the band disbanded it wasn't the end of the world we had some decent solo releases from gran Coxon and Damon Albarn sort of saw his career rocket off taking part masterminding in the animated rock and pop band Gorillaz he has also released a few solo records as of late to now just about five years ago we were getting some anticipation of a blur comeback because of some singles they were releasing out of the blue but since then I don't know I've kind of come to accept a world without blur and I just figured that if blur ever were to come back in a full-length album format it would only be because they had a grand very significant artistic statement to make if blur ever were to come back would they just give us a nostalgia trip give us those old records give us that old-school sound or would they continue to push and give us a left hook like they did with their last LP but blur actually continues to take risks on this new LP here with one of their most somber collections of songs yet a lot of the tracks on this new album here remind me of how just uncomparable dreary a lot of the songs were on the last damon albarn album the difference though with the magic whip is that the instrumental presence of this record is so much larger and a little punchier and as a result this album has more bite but I wouldn't say bite is necessarily a selling point of this album obviously this record is nowhere near as aggressive as an album like Park life or even some of the more hard-hitting tracks off of blurs last full-length LP the magic whip is essentially a mellower more instrumentally refined version of blur and maybe to instrumentally refine two points like on songs like ghost ship the glistening cents on this track the sunny guitars the kind of tropical vibe of this track the title of this song is funny because rather than a ghost ship actually feel like I'm on a yacht listening to some grade-a Yacht rock though I will say for yacht rock it's not completely gross and is actually legitimately soothing relaxing and pleasant to listen to even on the really punchy Rock opener the song lonesome streetwear blur brings back that sort of old-school Britpop sound this track too feels just a little too reserved especially for a kickoff for a comeback record I do like the kind of sad instrumental shift the song takes as it kind of glides into the chorus and then kicks back into the crunchy guitars as it goes back into the verses but still you know just kind of a mild performance here the record continues to sound kind of tame as we get into the song go on which has this lone groove that gets kind of tedious as the track plods along and even though the song tries to be maybe a bit of noise rock or just noisy rock with these abrasive guitars and kind of shrill keyboards orbiting around the beat the track just isn't that interesting because there's not a good song backing it up but there are actually some upbeat tracks on this LP that I like such as the song on really one of the standout tracks on this record when it comes to just pop appeal I love the really sunny upbeat chorus vocals that start the tract off as well as the refrain on this song I wanna be with you sounds like something that would have done really well on the pop charts in the 50s but just with more of a modern production punch and the kind of aggressive and feisty I broadcast is a highlight in the middle of this record - but my favorite moments on this LP the songs I find to be the most passionate are the tracks that are sadder like with the track Pyongyang which has this dark twined guitar lead and some electronic beats hanging in the background it's kind of post-punk II and I love the very warm instrumental shift this song brings when it glides into the course it kind of sounds like a sunrise coming after a very dark introduction and the song new world Towers um really eerie sticky melody on this track no towers and one of the I guess more depressing vocal performances on this LP but but in a good way and that it's actually affecting and kind of powerful feeling pretty much the same way about the song might terracotta heart and then we have ice cream man where we actually get mention of the title on this record and the Sun is sad as well I love the quirky keyboard here and also the the lyrical imagery as well while the music here does sound sad what Albarn is singing about on this track does bring I guess kind of a playful undertone I guess you could say it's an unexpected lyrical direction for a song that sounds this sad and the track there are too many of us the tune here is decent I think the song itself is maybe a little bit overblown because the productions are so grand and trying so hard to be dramatic especially with these just punchy strings this song is like like blurs Eleanor Rigby and the song on the surface kind of seems to be about overpopulation but there's really a feel of loneliness and isolation coming through and some of the subtext of these lyrics for me and the song I thought I was a spaceman another one of the sadder tracks on here with a kind of explosive ending it builds up to this nice climax in the middle of the track and then goes into this just full-blown rock instrumentation while I wasn't Huw on the tune here I did like the fact that the instrumentation just the sound of this track a lot of evocative sounds here feeling like Albarn or just our protagonist is sort of lost in the middle of space or in the middle of the track when the instrumentation really gets going is blasting off into space overall a good mixed bag of tracks from blur no amazing flow to this or anything like that but decent stylistic variety a good mix of just more hard-hitting and catchy as well as mellow and sad songs and they're both hits and misses on both sides of that aisle this record may not sound like an old-school blur record and it may kind of sound like a Damon Albarn solo album but it's still a really good collection of tracks but it's still a really good collection of tracks and I would say far from a disappointing return I'm feeling 80 some strong 7 on this LP tram how's that drama going how's that drama that drama taste and good you like that drama is that drama going good for you how's that trauma going you're lacking that drama oh yeah yeah you like that drama that's some good drama right there mmm-hmm you're the best I love you I hope you have a nice day and I hope you dug this record as much as me if not more loved you already said that forever "},{"id":"Numr-bT7e6w","title":"Willow Smith - Ardipithecus ALBUM REVIEW","y":3,"x":"I've never been in this situation uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Willow Smith album Ardipithecus rock nation artist singer/songwriter and daughter of famed rapper and actor Will Smith Miss Willow Smith suddenly drops her debut album added nowhere here it is something I think most people would have expected about five years ago when the release of Willow Smith's original break out single wit my hair came out but after the release of this song it seems like she quickly sidestepped between pop direction she had been going in after fireball and 21st century girl it seems like she just hit the emergency ejector seat button on that aside from a couple mysterious soundcloud drops here and there she pretty much vanished out of the music world's eye but now she's just suddenly teleported in front of us with this new full-length album with a title and a cover that has kind of an evolution theme to it it seems that willow has taken this time of relative silence to become an altogether different and new music artist following this evolution over here where it would seem she ends it like some dr. Manhattan looking physical form sure I didn't really even expect this record to come out so I'm not really sure what to expect of it all I know is that I'm probably not going to get another radio smash on here or anything like that she's obviously gone out of her way to not define herself as just a tween Billboard chart topping pop artist on this one so what is she doing instead not not anything I particularly enjoy the opening track on this thing is easily five of the most pretentious minutes of music I've had to sit through this year it's so convinced of its greatness it's so convinced that it's making some kind of grand poignant urgent state that we all need to hear some kind of self defining statement that's going to solidify Willow Smith in our minds as a legitimate weighty thought-provoking artist we're right out of the gate she drops this line classification an organization or oh I dunno by Jove odd right now right side which is like the biggest truth bomb that anyone's ever dropped since Hobson's did the man who invented go to college go to college line came out on his last LP and she follows this line up with I said it like yeah I said it that really needed to be said but the track in a way is almost like a tale of growth about how willow kind of came to the point where she is now where she would be making this music talking about herself the fact that she's a teenager talking about being afraid to do things like I guess the singing and the rapping that she's doing on this record but kind of being encouraged to do so and now she's come to this point and she tells this tale and many others with these really yell P grading vocals that I'm kind of on the fence with in one breath I like that she's doing something really raw and in your face and and a little on the fringe her voice certainly has its quirks to it a lot of range although she doesn't have full control of a lot of that range as it seems like she's kind of just spinning out of control a lot of the time while she's singing and in another breath a lot of the time her singing just seems so convinced of its own arts enos and uniqueness I feel like she's turned onto some interesting things I hear notes of maybe a little bit of Bjork or even Robert Smith if I would even get ambitious enough to guess that she's listening to the Cure or something like that maybe even a little Alanis Morissette or something but sometimes her lyrics are so stomach-churning ly narcissistic I mean her words sometimes read like her brothers Twitter feed which is nuttier than a squirrel turd every attempt this record makes it sounding deep and artful it just sounds so out of touch and shallow like on the song natives of the windy forest which is pretty much just this indigenous music knockoff that's so short and half-hearted it might as well not even been on record there's quite a bit of filler on this LP so you know don't expect to hear too many well-developed songs from the beginning to the end of it's almost one hour run time then we have the song drugs with a Z because it's rebellious where I don't really feel like I'm crying with Willow Smith as much as I'm crying for Willow Smith on this track the production and this song is not unique in this is so painfully plain and musically rudimentary that I'm just not really getting much from this song but the track is mired in willows emotions her sadness her angst the angst on this album is so oppressive in such a focal point on this thing if you're not wrapped up in Willow Smith's emotional tornado on this record then I don't think this album is going to have that much for you because musically a lot of the time this thing is kind of a a barren wasteland that anybody with maybe about a year or so of experience in a variety of different dawes and electronic music programs could probably pull together anything that is on this album so again it's kind of a barren wasteland kind of a desert with the occasional snakebite of yeah yeah yeah but it's not so high-pitched and it's not so out there that it's like going down Yoko Ono territory or anything like that it's very safe despite the fact that it's convinced it's doing something artsy and experimental again I appreciate that it seems like she's trying to do something a little more out there a little more artsy with her voice she's totally in control of her artistic self but I think that control of self requires self-control and discipline which this album has very little of as it sounds like Willow Smith and whoever she's working with on the variety of these songs think that every noise that comes out of her mouth is great and just worth slapping onto the record and it's just not true very few of the tracks on here are well groomed and the few that do have very well defined verses and choruses and all that like the song why don't you cry are actually really awful when it comes to writing like really mediocre writing the lyrics and just the hook of the constant why are you anyway why don't you cry again unless you're really emotionally invested in Willow Smith as a person and you just kind of want to hear her narcissistically explore her young and angsty emotions on a full-length album with very little in the way of sonic or musical appeal then this album is for you but it's not for me I'm feeling a light too decent three on this thing transition have you given this album a listen and if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and smash the like you're the best will of Smith music Anthony Fantana needle drop forever "},{"id":"a1olq-lfc-I","title":"Post Malone - beerbongs & bentleys ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone beer theny bong tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new post Malone album beer bongs and Bentley's this is the latest album from white Iverson himself post Malone mr. Austin Richard post who blew up back in 2015 off of a pretty hot song white Iverson after that he dropped a mixtape eventually we had his full-length commercial debut stony late 2016 in December it's an album that at the time didn't cause a gigantic splash but it slowly gained him more and more momentum over the course of 2017 now I did not care for the album for a lot of different reasons which I'm not gonna rehash in this video I originally slapped Stoney with with a not good my negativity toward this record most likely inspired a lyric on this new album over here we don't follow trends rest in peace - yamo your new shit sucks I feel like Anthony Fantana but when it comes to posts Malone's new stuff at least the teaser tracks from this album my reactions have been far from negative in 2017 post landed one of the biggest songs of the year rockstar a track that I ranked as being one of my favorite singles of the year I think his best single so far one of his best songs to date really the first song from him that I honestly loved and not just because the hook was sharp as hell and the 21 savage feature was really cold not just because the production was incredibly grand and eerie and atmospheric a lot of my attraction that the song has to do with the singing I mean post singing on this track has really smoothed out it features a good balance of his his actual voice the tambour of his voice and some auto-tune the mixing on the vocal sound better as well and at the time I remember thinking hey you know if he could make a song this good maybe he'll pull through on beer bongs and Bentley's maybe it'll happen now in a lot of ways this record is is merely an improvement on the Stoney formula it's about the same tracklist length and runtime the same blend of trap style production and auto-tune vocals and moody R&B but this time around the sound is measurably better so are the vocal performances two posts singing on this album is definitely more versatile it's not nearly as amateurish or annoying weak were washed out in effects the production across the board on this thing sounds a lot more grand as well very intoxicating very chilly I'm not gonna say it's reinventing the wheel or groundbreaking if you've kept up with rae sremmurd or travis scott or like the weekend you kind of know the vibe that post Malone is going for especially on tracks like taking shots which is this really generic drinking track really generic party track and for whatever reason the instrumental ski and has this vibe that reminds me of Kanye West's fucked my life from his tea lap record so there are definitely similarities that post has to his contemporaries his music is very much the product of the current state of music the trend the trap trend that we found ourselves trapped in but simultaneously post has effectively with this album carved out a little niche for himself in the oversaturated field of part rappers part singers I mean there are a couple of obvious shortcomings on this thing the fact that it did not really truly need to be an hour I mean there aren't that many highlights on here posts sound his style isn't that varied nor are his lyrics so substantive and thoughtful that he has enough stories or angles to pack throughout this record I mean the song 92 explorer for example it's not bad it's listenable it's just as listenable as nearly any other song on here but is it really adding anything to the tracklist that the previous tracks didn't already not really I kind of feel the same way about the song candy paint as much as the aesthetic of the track is is uniquely glamorous and dreamy the vocal melody is just super tedious and and structurally it's pretty weak so there are moments where it does feel like post is kind of padding the tracklist out most likely because putting out a project of this length with this many tracks on it is just kind of the name of the game in the age of streaming got to get those plays get those plays baby and as much as I realize that that is the business model it doesn't make this album any less of a slog especially when post is subjecting me to tracks like spoil my night which might have the trashiest vocal melody on the entire record one of the worst sway lis features I've heard him drop in the past year I've never been like a small fry and some of the most for Kilis lyrics on the entire project before the existence of this verse I was really a devout atheist but I'm pretty sure now that I've seen two rock references and a Jumanji reference within the same block of text that is proof that God exists obviously the same divine inspiration that went into writing the Bible went into writing this if you now open up to your Elevens condiment you'll see thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's beautiful boobies so as ridiculous as a few parts of this album are I have to admit that most of this album it sounds like pure hits hits on hits on hits and I guess I don't mind the lyrics being a little shallow if it means that the tracks are just impeccably produced impeccably catchy and I think post does make an effort on this album - pepper songs and verses throughout it where you do get a little bit more introspection it does seem like he pulls back the veil a little bit gets a bit more personal that's the vibe that I get on the opening track paranoid on the album as he's singing dramatically over this very sad moody instrumental about how he's watching his back and he can't trust anybody referencing Edward Snowden who honestly does not get referenced enough he really doesn't in post defense I mean he has gotten a lot of hate over the past few years some deserve it some not so I definitely get the angle he's taking with this track but really was stunned me about this song is that his voice sounds so much more dynamic on this track than it did on nearly any other song on stony he has such an emotional vibrato on this track and and many others here he hits all these passionate cracks on the hook as soon as he really starts to push that volume and I think he's generally doing a better job of kind of wearing his emotions on his sleeve as he's performing those emotions also translate on the track rich and sad a track where seems like he's wishing that this person who he had as a love interest stayed in his life either before or after the money all I really get a sense of on this track is that the money wasn't making this person stay he couldn't buy this person's love and that he would trade all the money and all the success to get this person back it's one of the most emotionally compelling portrayal of loneliness and fame that I've heard from a pop rapper at Malone's level in a while not to mention the vocal melody on the hook just has engrained itself in my brain I would throw it out of the way I just keep up wishing that my name is Dan the song Zach and codeine as in referencing The Suite Life of Zack and Cody that is one of several intoxicating and incredibly blissful party tracks on the album probably the best one here but still one that I have a hard time rationalizing considering that you do have a moment on this record where post is shouting out ASAP yams but then simultaneously talking about rinsing his mouth out with codeine and how his life is sweet like codeine still it's a pretty bubbly track super catchy and makes me feel like I'm swimming through the ocean the song over now is one of the most dramatic tracks on the entire album really second only to blame it on me oh god those thick layered vocal harmonies on that track it sounds so weird and robotic and epic and bouncing back and forth between taking the blame but that not wanting to take the blame it just seems like he's he's tearing himself emotionally apart from the inside but the song over now is one of the most aggressive relationship ending songs I've heard in a while like he's talking about putting that pussy in a body bag it's over it's done I don't even want you anymore ah it's like he's just kicking down the door on this relationship and just he's so unapologetic on this track yet also admitting what an idiot he was he's just in the throes of this angry relationship psychosis and it's it's pretty heavy the song psycho while it did under well me a little bit when I first heard it has grown on me it's kind of got this nice a nocturnal summery vibe to it and I have to admit that ty dolla sign and post Malone are a good complement for one another and even though maybe at its core it's just kind of like a cheap relationship song you know getting over that other person who you used to be with and so on and so forth I think better now might be this album sleeper hit I mean it's just too insanely catchy and cut and dry for it not to latch on to the hearts of of posts young audience whatever a guy or girl makes them feel bad you know I say that I am better now better not to mention that this is one of many tracks on here I feel like post separates himself a bit from a lot of his competition and that you do kind of hear those subtle notes of guitar and bass actual guitar and bass being worked into his tracks he does kind of feel like he's more of a guitar strumming singer-songwriter just kind of belting out these songs about heartbreak then he is a rapper or a trap rapper he's just merely kind of using this production and this aesthetic to sell these songs that he's writing which we also get a glimpse of on the song stay which is essentially the the album's lone acoustic track which actually has some good chord progressions it's another moment on the album or post seems to be struggling with keeping a relationship together at this point on the record it's it's really kind of nothing new he's kind of been spinning these heartbreak anthems on on numerous points of the album so far and lyrically even though there are some pretty dramatic moments like oh my god you put her cigarette out on your face what the fuck it's not like the lyrics are so great that just stripping away all the bouncy heavy trap style production that you know I'm just being wowed by posts pen game you know as far as some of the other features on here goes I mean Nicki Minaj's was pretty good certainly better than than young Gerald's gez however I think I think best feature is is easily taken by yg on this thing and overall I'm just really happy I'm really pleased and and kind of surprised too I mean after hearing Rockstar of course as I said earlier I thought that post might be able to pull through on this one if you focused and came through with the sound that was as quality in a series of songs that were as catchy as what he had delivered on that single and for the most part he did that I mean he still has a ways to go in terms of building his style so that he's not just tediously repeating himself again and again and again and again and who knows if he'll ever really get there considering the audience that he's trying to attract with his music but on beer bongs and Bentley's I'm hearing improvements on all fronts and in quite a few again better production better singing better vocals better grasp of melody better grasp of song structure some pretty good performances too I can't hate on this one I really can't it's not that bad I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one

we're doing reviews on the road and we're just gonna be doing that for a little while right now but uh while we're here the reviews they're still gonna be the reviews that's it we're just gonna have to sit through it for a little bit longer Milo so the Flies don't come Milo is a Wisconsin rapper yes I believe is his second full-length commercial project I've been following Milo's exploits for a while now for mixtape to mix tape from ep to EP from album to now new album and it's been a pretty interesting road seeing him not only coming to his own and take a pretty unique and interesting approach to hip hop music just in general but also linked up with heroes of his through Hellfire Club which is a rap collective that he's affiliated with it's just been cool to see him over the past few years become an entirely different rap artist even if today he's still kind of rockin with that spoken word ish flow which isn't really super exciting but it's very emotional in delivery I think a lot of the time and Milo also has the tendency to just be a little too obtuse frustratingly obtuse or directionless or aimless large pointed here's what I'm saying type statements aren't really Milo's mo but that seems to be changing a little bit with this new full-length album which in a recent interview with him he told me that it was going to be a more confrontational record and after giving in numerous listens I would have to agree on this new project over here vocally and lyrically Milo is far more expressive than he was on the somewhat monotone toothpaste suburb I would say as expressive as he was on his debut mixtape but at this point he's far more mature and I think has things to say that carry a lot more weight still clever but not so much silly as much as he is I guess aggressive and maybe a little fed up on some of these tracks there's a serious urgency to a lot of what he's saying on this album even if the message he's trying to deliver isn't a parent on the first listen and the newly found fire in Milo's vocal delivery on this LP matches really well with Kenny seagulls beats whoo I understand does the production from beginning to the end of this album and the instrumentals on this record they're synthetic they're serene they're easygoing but they're very melodic and beautiful and intricate they have a very strong jazzy vibe to them as well so if you're looking for some modern synthetic jazz rap this is the record to try I love how eerie a lot of the melodies on this LP are especially on tracks like animist or how sad and somber they can run on the song souvenir which is toward the beginning of this album there is a fantastic and very expressive lyrical feature from hemlock ernst on this track and the first half of the song features mostly milo on here and he lyrically I think is kind of diving into his experiences in LA recently kind of being amongst these art rappers who kind of looks up to and gets a lot of experience and inspiration from but kind of growing sick of the lifestyle and kind of the position that he was in over there which in the interview that I had with him he kind of expressed drove him back to where he is now in Wisconsin to sort of fly solo and do his own thing and on this track lines pop up where he talks about how is a naivete leads him to being taken advantage of how he can rap like a black man he says on the track which is one of the many points on this record where he addresses a lot of racial stereotypes obviously Milo talking about how much he loves hip hop on this record but sort of avoiding doing it in kind of a traditional way much of the time however there are some spots on this record where he is legitimately flowing in the way that you would expect a rapper to flow and he actually sounds great during moments on on the record like this however his lyrics during these spots are especially biting which I like a lot however he doesn't really abandon sort of the more soft spoken and and I guess spacious flows that he's typically known for I would say this record features a pretty good mix of these two sides of Milo he continues to do what he's been doing better while showing us a whole different side of him that he's never really shown this much up until this point on the song Zen scientist Milo over very kind of patient beat is super aggressive in his own I guess kind of Milo way he comes off so determined and hungry on this track and I love the pitched vocals on this song as well as many of the other tracks here too and the vocal feature from Myka 9 is gorgeous as well I love lyrical imagery on this track like the moment where Milo's like kisses down you're on like Gomez rather than giving us this onslaught of lyrical spaghetti to sort of untangle I think he's given us some of the best of the best lyrics that he had for this record and it just leads to this album having a lot more punch like on the song and encyclopedia where I think Milo talks not only about some racial issues on this record but also how he's growing as a rapper making mention of some really interesting turns of phrase on here like when he says this is a mason jar with the last laugh and we get this demonic laugh sort of popping out in the track it's a pretty cinematic and sound rich record also making mentioned the fact that he plays these language games on his tracks with lyrics to the project takes an even more aggressive turn on the song going noplace featuring a lucid who is one of the grimy ax strapper x' in the new york underground right now and milo goes toe-to-toe with him or collaborates with him and keeps up with a flow that at some points feels little Earl inspired and Milo even gets kind of aggressive with his lyrics talking about a giving someone a hook fest totally unexpected for Milo but the thing is he's sounding more frustrated than he ever has on a track and it sounds legit there's just a lot of issues on this record where my low is venting really hard on a lot of things that he seems to have some very strong opinions on or just had negative experiences with while writing lyrics on this album like on the track true nen with open mike eagle who has a very cartoony over-the-top verse in the second half but Milo in the first half is again sort of going into this craft that he has such an incredible passion for talking about how he avoids soda because he can't afford health insurance because he writes rap songs for a living on the track yo Milo which I guess is kind of named after his Twitter account but in a way is kind of a series of snide and sort of tongue-in-cheek and clever responses to people who listen to his music who I think he doesn't feel has like a full understanding of what exactly he does or what he's trying to do talking about how he purposefully makes the lyrics abstract and and the messages that he says difficult and obtuse and and leaves the listeners playing with and fiddling with little pieces and bits of the images how he has people talking about how he's their favorite artist as far as like music that black people are making goes and unexpectedly this track occurs over what is pretty much like a dance beat yeah Milo on top of like a dance beat it's strange but it actually works Milo's flow which is way more traditional on this track than it is on any other song here is fantastic it actually goes over really well and he gets even speedier on the closing track on here which is an ode to bus driver which isn't too surprising not only because Milo just holds him in such high regard but there are some moments on this record where I really feel like he was heavily influenced by a lot of what bus driver was doing on his last full length album perfect hair sort of riding these fringes between making something that is abstract that is obtuse but is simultaneously very bold and in-your-face and uncompromising I feel like Milo went into this record right here with the same general concepts but had a completely different outcome because he's a completely for an artist's still though he does a really great job of I guess painting a surreal and playful and flattering picture of bus driver as a rapper as an artist while toward the beginning of the album he seems kind of frustrated with what might have been the short end of the stick while playing so closely shoulder to shoulder with a lot of these people while he was more affiliated more involved with Hellfire Club he still seems to have an incredible amount of admiration for these artists who have influenced him so much I really love this record I think it's Milo's best since his things that happen today things happen at night EPS I will say though I wished it was a little longer I mean this room is really maybe one or two tracks away from an EP and there are some songs on here like true nen as well as animist which I just wish were longer or had a stronger ending to it but even with a lack of incredibly strong endings on a handful of these tracks because there are some songs that dip right into the next track interestingly this record is still very fun it's very bold it's very moving there's a lot of large strong statements on this album even on the softest track here napping under the echo tree where Milo his flow style is just shoulder to shoulder with spoken word on this track and the beat is really slow-motion very syrupy very slow-paced and there's some wonderful strings woven into this very pitched sample and Milo's lyrics on this track are are easily some of the most powerful on the entire record if you're looking for a rapper who has a very alternative approach against some pretty melodic instrumentals with a strong jazzy flavor to them I mean I really think in a lot of ways Milo is kind of advancing the whole idea of jazz rap a little bit a little bit and it just goes over super super well super super tasteful and personal and and and wonderful it's it's awesome to kind of get this kind of in-depth look into Milo's psyche when it comes to these very intense emotions on the topics that he addresses throughout this record you really got to pay attention the lyrics on this thing but it's definitely worthwhile it's definitely worth reading into he's not quite as confusing as he typically can be and I think he really makes a real istening to this album worthwhile with his lyrics and also with Kenny seagulls a wonderfully intricate and just very pretty instrumentals I'm just going to keep saying nice things about this album if I keep going I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony

busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ski mask the slump god mixtape thing beware the Book of Eli the South Florida madman ski mask the slump Todd he's back if you've been following this channel you know that I've had high hopes for mr. mr. slump God for a while ever since he blew me away with some of the tracks on last year's you will regret mixtape now what made some of the tracks on that mixtape so special slump gods super speedy lightning fast flows hilarious gross similes his really animated one-of-a-kind delivery his spazzy ad-libs and the deranged jittery and abrasive trap production that he typically hops on top of one issue though is the tape was kind of on the short side the slump God ended up reloading the thing with singles and other tracks he released afterwards which overall improved the quality and the flow of the tape quite a bit however I do wish some of that material actually ended up landing on here instead songs like catch me outside and baby wipe there were also a few tracks on this thing where I felt like ski mask was kind of swapping out his unique one-of-a-kind delivery and flow to make something a bit more auto crew knee a bit more trendy overall this tape just read to me like a decent project from an artist with a ton of potential so now comes in beware the Book of Eli which has its own set of pros and cons absolutely this tape is more consistent than you will regret originally was ski mask seems to have a firmer grip on what exactly it is that makes him unique as an artist and he hones in on that with hilarious one-liners really odd reference points dropping lines were you saying that he wants to spoon this girl like add animals or slurp her like a go-gurt or on the opening track to this thing where he's rapping about a girl looking him up and down like an elder scroll or him saying that his diamonds are cleaner than a baby dog's tongue I'm at yo head like a hair so in Hyden seek where's your hairline going your bitch icky Vicky that hoe got the cooties only time I would touch her when I give her noogies either that or what I'm trying to rub off one of my boogies honestly that's just the tip of the iceberg on this tape when it comes to how ludicrous ski masks lyrics can get overall I wouldn't say the substance and content to what ski mask is saying is all that different than a lot of his contemporaries from the SoundCloud set from the trap banger set but he definitely sets himself apart from all of them with the supremely weird way that he delivers it all coming out rapid-fire on these insanely tight triplet flows enhanced by equally speedy and in twiki ad-libs and incredibly explosive production on the opening track to this thing lost souls I don't know whether to laugh my ass off or just go wild just the idea of drowning someone in the river of lost souls in the chorus of this track I don't know just just kind of feels like a different experience also loved the ultra distorted trunk knocking beat on this thing eerie warped sense I mean I'm not crazy about rich the kid I find him to be one of the more generic rappers out there currently but he does keep the energy level high when he does feature the song run features production from Timbaland surprisingly I love the eerie little woodwinds since he throws into the track it's yet another moment on the record including the opening track that seems to play into this idea of magic mysticism almost like fairy tales I mean just look at the cover of this thing it looks like a child's fantastical storybook now even though this track lasts like one minute and 47 seconds which is not the only track on this thing that lasts about that length of time but still even with things being as short as they are on this project slump God makes a genius use of his time by just being hyper focused on the structure of these songs because in under two minutes he still gets in an intro two verses and two choruses which I guess goes to show that with him rapping faster he can finish songs faster the diaper intro gag at the start of the song throwaway is quite literally throw away but still this song is another highlight for me in the track listing here especially with ski masks like weird warped contorted fro a repetition chant on the hook throw away throw away throw away throw right why I cannot even make my voice do whatever the hell he does on the track while this is one of the more low-key tracks in the track listing it's really just oozing with ski masks eccentricity even when he pumps the brakes on a song just a little bit he's riding the fringes so hard then we have the unapologetic banger coolest monkey in the jungle obviously in reference to that whole H&M hoodie ordeal there are a few bars on here as well as on other tracks to where he's kind of poking fun at racists or making fun of her threatening the KKK and on this song yet again we have references to witches and him being a wizard more allusions to magic and fantasy it doesn't come up on this tape so often I would say it's a concept but it definitely brings a vibe now this track like many others delivers more gut-busting verses both ski mask and his feature on here make reference to you family guys Quagmire's key catchphrase giggity and while the feature verse on this thing may not be as amped as ski masks it certainly has a similar twisted sense of humor the song suicide season features this slow dreary eerie be definitely another cool down moment on the album the sample of which I can't play sounds like something out of a an old children's storybook cartoon but now flipped into a dark suicidal trap banger with ski masks making reference to sex making his his desire for death kind of melt away I wish the song we're a bit longer given that it is one of the darker moments on here and that the lyrical tone kind of matched the instrumental vibe of the song a bit more but still the track is pretty much a highlight for me another song child's play I mean when it comes to aggressive tracks on here this track is just it's easily the most insane of the bunch 5k 10k what I make today God that refrain is an earworm and just the rumbling bass the distorted over driven bass on this thing damn it the song is murderous weird hyper aggressive the Chuckie references on the hook are funny now I will say that there is a bit of a lull in the middle of this project which I mean for a project of this size you really don't want it's just 20 minutes it's just 10 tracks you can't really afford to have a lull the song do I have the sauce has a very cool vibe very cool flow some of the lines on here are highlights like him saying that he wants to bend that the letter C or him saying Sesame Street I'm a monster for that cookie however there are also some erykah badu and cow jumping over the moon lines and references that really could have been much funnier don't hit quite as hard and overall across the entire tape I'll say that the two verses on this song or maybe two of the least eccentric here and then there's also the matter of the hook the a halt halt halt yeah the chorus is mostly ski-mask kind of saying aha rhythmically and it wouldn't be the only repetitive chorus on the record but it just seems so off-the-cuff and just I don't know just thrown out there it's weird but I don't know to me this track just kind of falls flat flatter than every other song here anyway a lot of these same issues kind of transfer over onto the song geeking but with a different vibe a different style as this is yet another slow moody autocrine ballad and while I wasn't head over heels for it and yet again it feels like a moment where ski masks personality takes a backseat to the style the trend the sound that he's chasing after he does do a better job with this sound and going in this direction though then he did previously so that's good I actually still kind of hear him on the track doesn't sound like a Travis Scott ripoff just a bit more personality length and maybe even a feature or what could have made the song so much better as far as the finish of this thing goes ski mask mostly sticks the landing bukake and dapper dan don't bring much to the table that previous tracks didn't already though I will say dapper Dan's quotables are much greater than that of bukkake not to mention on that closing track we're having another unnecessary rich the kid feature here this one seemingly less interesting than the first overall though I really enjoyed this tape I really loved a vast majority of what was here and I don't know it's just like a really killer short deadly funny creative out-there dense entertaining and totally cracked project that I certainly recommend ski mask has definitely improved since his last project he's clearly gotten a better sense of the direction he wants to go into and as good as this project is I'm seeing still more potential in what he's doing I just hope he continues to take what he's doing here hones it finds ways to improve tracks like geek and if he is going to go in that direction and finally on his next drop just puts out something a bit more substantial because while I really enjoyed listening to this tape simultaneously I just feel starved with ten tracks with 20 minutes I'm starving I'm feeling a strong 72 a light eight on this

for a review of the new juice world album goodbye and good riddance this is the debut commercial full-length album of Chicago based trap balladeer juice world who is hitting it kind of big right now with the lyrical lemonade crowd and he's not your typical auto crooner in comparison with a lot of his contemporaries he's a lot more tortured and depressing a bit darker and more heartbroken you could draw a lot of artistic parallels between this and a lot of the Moody Spacey trap sounds that we've been hearing artists explore over the past few years but juice seems to consciously be mixing these sounds with elements of emo emo music which comes partially from his very boyish and kind of whiny vocal delivery also from the melodies that he chooses to sing of course these emo vibes pour through on the lyrics in his songs too I still see your shadows in my room can't take back the love that I gave you it's to the point where I love and I hate you and I cannot change you so I must replace you oh there are a lot of very clear and recurring themes on this thing of having a broken heart and having trust issues I mean there's even a track on here titled all girls are the same also take these lyrics from the song use to I've been drinking and driving and survive and take my sorrow and bear me alive in it wear your best dress girl cuz you're gonna die hit it bet you regret the day you lied in it when I'm listening through a lot of these tracks I kind of get part emotional trauma but also part unintentional hilarity because the lyrics are just so goddamn melodramatic especially with the twinkly little guitar samples laced into this particular instrumental also from the song heard me sticks and stones may break my bones but the drugs won't hurt me the drugs won't hurt me ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone but the bitch can't hurt me so I'm not worried he's just an emotional boy okay he's just a young emotional boy but what's funny about this track and a lot of others on here the melodies on this thing just really seared themselves into my brain after just a couple of listens I enjoy a bulk of the lyrics on this album for a mix of different reasons sometimes I think they're so bad that they're good other times I think that they are legitimately compelling but truth be told they are not very deep poetic or profound given their subject matters of relationships and emotional issues even when juice breaks the fourth wall on a track and shows a hint of self-awareness he fails to really add another dimension to what exactly it is he's doing like when he sings listen to my story it's depressing heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing devil trying to test me I'm failing and hailing you took it all back so while no I don't doubt that juice world has had his heart broken or done the drugs he sings about in his songs he just kind of takes a very surface level and reductive approach to these topics which in a way I guess is kind of in line with his emo and trap roots because there's a lot of crappy emo music out there that's not really that deep it's like a fake deep cry for attention basically white suburban men pretending to be a wounded bird emotionally to get the attention of women there have been a lot of artists taking this whole trap thing into a more melodic direction lately and juice world certainly takes a lot of cues from people like young thug and Uzi vert and little yachty and juice world is far from the first person to go emo or rock or metal with this sound either probably the most recent and most popular example of this has to be the late little peep who in his music also explored similar themes of addiction and depression and love on the rocks on good riddance there are a handful of very good highlights typically when juice brings a very good beat a melody a tune some decent lyrics my favorite in the tracklisting surprisingly may be the song black and white I don't know what it is about this song is that the nostalgic toy music box synthesizers is that the way juices vocals break as he sings in like an upper register at the intro of the song is it the lyrics about him and his friends just kind of commiserating and doing drugs together I'm in my white Benz and I'm doing codeine with my white friends it's just something so freaking infectious about this track it kind of gets me choked up too I also dig the song candles quite a bit - I love the dense layers of auto-tune vocal harmonies on this track and there's something really odd about the groove and the rhythmic pacing of the vocal melody on the hook of this thing now even though there are some tracks on this thing that I legitimately love and sort of make me look forward to hopefully a brighter future for juice world there are plenty of cuts on here where I think vocally emotionally lyrically he does go a little overboard bordering on being obnoxious or just kind of feeling like the sadness of this record is very forced the song I'm still features one of the worst vocal melodies on the hook of the entire record meanwhile reading into the lyrics of scared of love feels similar to that of like diving into a really bad cringy teenage diary entry there are other low points on here like the half-hearted hook on the track long gone or the really awful and basic similes on the song end of the road there are also a few tracks on here where it sounds like the mixing could use a little bit of work because occasionally there's a song here and there that sounds noticeably more lo-fi than the rest of the cuts on the record and on top of that across the length of the entire album juice world comes off kind of one-dimensional there isn't a whole lot of depth to what exactly he does even if it is pretty great in small doses on particular tracks because by the halfway point of this thing I mean he's kind of exhausted his whole shtick I'd say this album is mildly entertaining at points but just super inconsistent very much a mixed bag pretty shallow too but I can still walk away from this record having loved at least a couple of songs on it I'm feeling a strong five on this thing transition have

review of the new John Prine album the tree of forgiveness this is the latest full-length album from country and full crock veteran mr. John Prine who has been dropping records pretty consistently since the early 1970s but it wouldn't be until later in his career in late 90s that he would actually pen one of the genres greatest love songs and duets that's the song in spite of ourselves which just one look at the lyrics on this track they're so funny they're so endearing I mean really you put this song on any mixtape for BAE that's that's a win and while this track might be one of prides biggest songs one of his most totally out of nowhere hits it's it's not like this track is all that unique in his discography meaning that Prine has always had a way with words in that he never really minces them from the song illegal smile off of his self-titled debut where he's singing about drugs essentially being an outlet and how him doing drugs to feel better or gain some kind of catharsis isn't hurting anybody or the track don't bury me off of the sweet revenge record a few years later an album where Prine dabbled in just just a touch of outlaw country but prayin is is really no outlaw he's not a gun slinging badass or anything like that he's just a songwriter who does a really great job of balancing balladry with bluntness talking about how he's okay with being fried up in a pan by cannibals as long as he has his one-man on the song ah heck or describing like this wild courtship and in rug burns that he has going on with this iron or Betty woman a few tracks later on the same album when it comes to love and life and social issues that there's nothing really off the table for prime and while he has mellowed out over the years a little bit and his voice has never really quite been the same since his battle with cancer in the late 90s he still has a way of putting things that very few other artists do and now that he's transitioning into his twilight years I would say he's he's putting a heaping helping of charm to kind of sweeten the harsh reality of a lot of these lyrics to I mean I hope I'm half as charismatic as John is on this when I'm his age because his warm personality just pours through on this album it's so goddamn likeable pretty much all the tracks on this record feature very mild rustic instrumentation laid to a somewhat pristine recording the performances on this album feel incredibly organic and intimate many of them riding tried-and-true chord progressions which if you are a full core a country music fan you may have heard them before and topping these songs is of course John Pines warbly slurred and and somewhat gravelly voice which of these three sides you're kind of hearing of his vocal I think depends on the song the emotion of the track the sentiment given prions age his voice is actually still quite dynamic occasionally there's a track in the tracklist that might lack in prions usual wit or grit i think the song ordinary blue is the the biggest offender of that as it just kind of sounds like one of the most ordinary tracks on the entire record and there are moments where this album is so sentimental that it hurts which some listeners might just find to be part of his charm on tracks like boundless love or one of my favorite cuts on the record the quaint and endearing I have met my love today but outside of that there are some real and undeniable highlights throughout much of this LP certainly the case for songs like egg and daughter night Nebraska 1967 where Prine writes lyrics about aging about southern culture about truth against some really sweet saloon piano and organ some clapping some nice background vocals toward the end of the track Brian's lyrics deal more in getting old and deteriorating he's clearly an artist who not only cries in the face of low points in one's life but also laughs the song caravan of fools is easily one of the darkest cuts pryin has ever recorded across his entire career and i feel like one of the things that has allowed him to do that is just the gravelly just tremendous dark depths of his vocal range now the song almost seems to be about the negative side of human nature maybe not stemming necessarily from some sort of inherent evil but ignorant or idiocy driving people to make horrible and stupid decisions this record also kicks off for the hootenanny of an intro the song knockin on your screen which is a track where John kind of closes his eyes and it kind of takes him back home all of this imagery of laundry hanging and it being summer the train tracks what most likely inspired the song is in the process of writing this record from what I understand prions family essentially sent him to a hotel because I guess in his experience he does some of his best writing on the road at hotels so he was totally out of his house out of his element and just had to kind of sit there and write these songs in that hotel in the lyrics of this track I kind of get the hint that he's writing from that standpoint where he is here he has to work on this stuff but he's feeling incredibly homesick there's also the lonesome friends of science a song that kind of hit me as as being almost like Brian's inner Randy Newman coming out a little bit in a way the track is almost a little anti science or anti progress in pryin would rather plead blissful ignorance than understand the truth of life and the world around him but I still thought it was kind of quaint and interesting how it almost seemed like according to him that he doesn't really care what's going on in the world outside of himself because he doesn't feel like he lives in it he feels like instead he lives inside his head and I can kind of understand and sympathize with that mindset when one gets up in age and maybe wants to keep their day-to-day life as stress and drama free as possible so you just kind of give in to the most simplistic approach to day-to-day life in your worldview just to kind of keep things moving smoothly either way the song has a note of serenity to it that I love and again John's blissful ignorance on the track is kind of intoxicating the song when I get to heaven is a closer on the album and maybe one of the funniest and most profound on the entire record the track is part narration and part song and the track is all about everything that he'll want to do once he gets upstairs so to say that he'll have a cocktail he's gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long he's gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt awhirl everything that he either shouldn't or can't do on the earth now deeper into the lyrics of the track he's talking about getting back into show business and inviting some choice critics to to his venue forgiving people who have may have wronged him in the past and getting back together with his family talking about how when he was younger his dad said when you're dead you're a dead peckerhead and that's it and he's hoping to uh prove him wrong the record rounds out at 10 tracks 30 minutes or so and it's a sweet little album it's not Brian's greatest artistic feat nor is it I think his most profound set of tracks but for the most part prions age and experience work to his benefit on this record greatly it leads to lots of insight charisma and and very authentic SAP and also to mention once again the simplistic instrumentation prions aged voice are incredible on this record for the most part I'm feeling a decent 2stronk

unknown Mortal Orchestra record multi Love unknown moral or past wrong what don't we know Oh cat couch esta it's not the same all right get back back unknown Mortal orchestra is a band currently that I believe hails from Portland Oregon's is their third full-length LP they play a bit of psychedelic rock and pop and in the past I've had my reservations about their music like with the band's debut record which to me had some pretty I guess skeletal half-baked songs on it some weirdly mixed instrumentation and these very booming crispy drums but the band really came through on their sophomore record to where the keys and the guitar work on this LP were much more impressive in the previous album and I would say a lot of the songs on this LP were pretty refined melodically as well some very interesting instrumental passages on this thing and on the cell P I think unknown Mortal orchestras quirky production style really started to work in their favor as their songs were kind of sounding like these quirky unearth demos of fantastic little b-side songs from the 60s and 70s kind of these just lost gems or relics there were a few kind of generic garage rock spots in this LP but going into this new album over here I pretty much just came into it hoping that unknown Mortal Orchestra would continue down that more lush colorful musically melodic but also a very textured road I mean just kind of this place where great psych pop and rock meet with just some creative and weird off-the-wall idiosyncratic production and that's pretty much what I got I mean on multi love the the band really kind of held it on the garage rock and instead went down a road of top and soul as well as funk fusing that together with the psyche rock influences that pop up in their music already unknown Mortal orchestra definitely sounds kind of old school and vintage on this album but their strange production just leaves them sounding kind of new and and modern from the very end crisp drums which a lot of the time kind of sound like hip-hop break beats or something like that to the vocals which are really kind of raspy and quiet hushed like a ghostly kind of like I'm listening to a em Ward from another dimension or something like that and these vocals and drums take up a lot of room in the mix and the keyboards and the guitars and the bass just somehow get just squeezed just crushed and smothered in the middle there somewhere it's some really strange production that I don't think everybody is is going to dig but what I like about this album is that unknown mortal Orchestra are kind of taking the past and they are manipulating it and warping it in a really enjoyable and artistic way sort of like bands such as foxes Anor artists such as Ariel pink have done already and like the cover are on this LP the music itself sounds like this smudgy overexposed picture from several decades ago with an Instagram filter thrown on it for you know that kind of contemporary Flair and another thing that the cover art tells us about this album is that this record really is about kind of studio trickery and tinkering it sounds like more than ever unknown mortal Orchestra really kind of worked on making this record sound a certain way and honing the the tone and the mix and the EQ of every single sound and this thing to get it to sound so enjoyably warped I loved the rickety lo-fi disco soul feel of the song can't keep checking my phone the very regal and and melodic Keys that kick off the title track on this album no T lobe the vocal breakdown on this track with the handclaps kind of sounds like something that could have been worked into an EDM song or something like that you know given that had different production in the background just writing wise it kind of feels like um oh is is pulling from from that sound and it works out really well the song like acid rain is an overwhelmingly fun and punchy track kind of like Candyland psyckadeli uh relief fantastic synth line or guitar line on this thing you know sometimes just stuff is manipulated and it's squeezed and squished to the point where it's kind of hard to tell what instrument might be making a certain melody or something the world is crowded just another killer refrain and song here as well my issue with this LP though is that maybe there are a couple cuts that are a little bit too subdued instrumentally and in vocally and and the lo-fi production kind of leaves it feeling like a bit of a demo rather than a fully finished song and then there's also the song stage or screen which isn't too bad of a track but suddenly the song just ends and gives way to this sort of wall of synthesizers that feels like I don't know a bit of a cop-out and given that there are so few songs in the track listing here I don't really think you mo gave themselves that much wiggle room to sort of do weird stuff like that because you're essentially trading out an opportunity to just deliver a great tune to kind of just veer into this blah we're gonna do this now the closing track on this help he leaves this album feeling strong though it has a lot of bite blaring guitars I would say very hard rocking which is kind of a change of pace for this LP at the very end you know there weren't a whole lot of tracks in the tracklisting year that that hit so hard and hit so aggressively rather this album wins me over at least with just a lot of smooth wonderful melodies and and great grooves and just kind of quirky production uh I got to say um oh really did it on this one I think they came through with their most interesting and enjoyable album yet some of their best songs thus far and the best production I've heard on their records thus far and I think you know that this record interestingly sort of in a way displays that opinion or maybe displays that narrative as well by sort of showing this you know newly assembled studio that this album was created with along with the two previous records sitting in the background like this record you know is here because those two records were there and things are sort of moving in this you know linear fashion for the band and you know that's that's great you know it's a good record very good record so you know feeling a strong 7-2 a light eight on this thing transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana unknown Mortal orchestra forever "},{"id":"Lu7PAAopMyY","title":"Toxic Holocaust- Conjure and Command ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review toxic Holocaust conjure and command I went back and looked at some of my favorite LPS of this year so far and this is definitely one of 2011's more grim moments the personality and just attitude this LP is so horrifyingly ugly that it really ranks up there with Death Grips for me but this is not an experimental hip-hop album it's actually a thrash album the fourth to come out from this project fronted by multi-instrumentalist Joel grind who up until this point recorded and performed all of his albums himself his demos to the stars have really aligned for toxic Holocaust Joel is not solo anymore the project is performing with its best recording quality to date and this album offers up some of the most immediate and pummeling thrash hybrids I've heard in a while because toxic Holocaust is is not just a thrash metal band there have always been elements of hardcore punk crust punk and black metal powering the sound behind this music too but on Condren Command the aroma of black metal is kind of fading in the air and that's not necessarily a bad thing I actually think it's led to something with a lot more impact even on my first listen this LP was getting me really pumped and excited like some of my thrash crossover favorites I know this doesn't really have a classic sound like something from the cro-mags or suicidal tendencies may but I still get that same feeling here of just this unstoppable force the sound of this release is a little different from previous efforts there's little to no reverb on this thing it's not really drenched in effects it's pretty dry actually very lean the beefy as well it's nothing but muscle and bone dismembered limbs and corpses and it sounds so good on my stereo when I crank this thing oh it's so good loud the drums are fantastic the snare is really nice and punchy the cymbals aren't mixed too high like they were on previous toxic holocaust LPS and the rhythm guitars have a nice coarse grinding texture to them it's kind of like rubbing my fingers across some sandpaper or getting dragged across asphalt by a rope tied to the back of a pickup truck and joel grinds vocals for me he walks this perfect tightrope act of just being so forced and so loud that it holds my attention but he's not so extreme that i get tired of hearing him really quickly overall the sound of this album is very filthy it's very thick it's very grimy very grimy thrash album all the songs are covered in this really similar grime eNOS so much so to the point where when some of these tracks fly by even on the second listen of this LP you might get the feeling of oh this is Sammy Sammy but believe me when I say that that's not the case my eyes my ears kind of needed to adjust to the apocalyptic fog that these songs bring so this thing did offer a little bit more every time I listen to it again and actually it wasn't until my last listen that I really started getting into the lyrics and basically the words are about every ugly terrible thing that mankind has ever done lots of imagery of of dying breaths being hunted down by a murderer eating the rotting flesh of dead dogs nuclear fallout there's even the track on here where a woman is being burned at the stake because of course she is being religiously persecuted though the ugly picture is nice what I like most about the lyrics is that most of them are are detailing a store and that's what makes them really stick with me but even the less wordy moments on this LP still come off really great to me because the sound the riffs and the energy are all high quality because this thing is a thrash crossover record it's more of a focus on the grooves the breakdowns the momentum of these songs not really the the flashing musicianship that may pull some metal fans into their favorite thrash albums but I will say these guys are not as punked out as a lot of crossover acts maybe because there are some spots on here where I do notice some nice guitar solos even if they're short I noticed some key changes and some harmonious guitar layering that I think a more punked out band would would avoid and even though toxic Holocaust doesn't change it up a lot on this album it's not like I really need them to this thing only lasts 33 minutes I only have 10 tracks it's a nice quick shot of and this album definitely serves as a nice modern middle ground that I think metal fans and Punk fans can approach with excitement I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this loved the the hell out of it really enjoyable but what do you think of this album did you like it did you hate it why and what should I review next thanks for watching love you Anthony Fantana toxic Holocaust forever "},{"id":"ASYMfU7wpiI","title":"Agalloch- Marrow of the Spirit ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest isn't fizzy as is he busy Asst usik nerd very busy this week yesterday's Kanye review insanity it seems like my review either wasn't scathing enough or wasn't positive enough or just wasn't Anthony I'm really happy for you I'm gonna let you finish but you should really stay on topic here because this is not your your Kayne review you know what he's right this is the new Agalloch record mero of the spirit these guys are an Oregon outfit whose music just seems to kind of be a term magnet black metal post rock folk do metal and in a way it's true this new LP and a Glocks three previous albums are pretty genre-bending but from my point of view black metal really is the most obvious stylistic influence for fans of the more classic more popular sounds in black metal for the most part they're here tremolo picking the really thrashy drum beats of course the retched vocals but in a way we're kind of sailing on a very different ship here unlike a lot of black metal artists the recording quality on this thing is very clean and frontman John Hagen hope I'm pronouncing that correctly if I'm not okay he does scream on here but there are a lot of chilling whispers on here the sound as if death is kind of breathing down your neck on the watchers monolith there's this really strange eerie old man vocal that kind of comes in it's very clean it's played straight but it just sounds very archaic I don't know and on the fourth track around the seven-minute mark he lets out this really tortured hell that just chilled me to the bone and just got me standing at attention really fantastic there's a heavy fulk influence on this thing too which shouldn't be a surprise if you're already a fan of these guys there are a lot of acoustic guitar strumming chords underneath harmonized guitar solos lots of of Nordic melodies and it's not just like this thing switches off between oh it's electric now it's full whoo it's electric now it's full this thing is constantly blending the two in different fashions what I love about Agalloch on this LP is they have an extreme extreme appreciation for dynamics and layers and in a way it reminds me of how overworked folk elements into their early work another band this LP reminds me of and maybe you guys saw this coming is wolves in the throne room also a West Coast metal band also very black metal influenced also very ambitious very atmospheric music I especially see a lot in common with these guys in terms of song lengths the tracks here are long as hell one of the longest being 17 minutes and one of the most amazing things about this may be the biggest success of that album is that a gallant manages to stay engaging throughout every moment of this LP for me the track may start with some crickets maybe some water just some nature sounds build into a guitar intro some grumbles some weird sounds bring in the drums bring on the vocals start building it up layer those guitars out change up the vocal style bring it to a climax boil it down to a drone another guitar interlude explode one more time bow wow close curtain these tracks are constantly changing from one idea to another none of them are stagnant it's a really progressive record but it's not flashy it's very well recorded but it still manages to maintain a dark atmosphere and some harsh sounds as well and in terms of gripes I really don't have many in comparison to their earlier work especially their last LP ashes against the grain this album is not as heavy I would say it doesn't get as pummeling it doesn't reach that point of high volume but I feel like that was a conscious choice here the band has kind of swapped out that overbearing distortion for more sounds and more melody and it might not have been a bad exchange if you're a person who likes their music be varied immediate I could see this thing dragging on for you and even for some black metal fans the vocals here might feel maybe a little silly maybe a little jokey who knows but from where I'm standing this album doesn't feel like that at all I'm feeling a decent eight on this thing but I feel like I'm still yet to understand the album completely it really unfolds there's a lot to listen to and there's a lot to uncover with repeated listens it's one of those albums and I love music like that I'm putting this thing on the love list what did you guys think of it did you enjoy it do you take Agalloch seriously are they an important black metal band or do most black metal fans shun these guys for their popularity outside of the genre and also should I review this tomorrow should I review that tomorrow and if not this what what should I review Anthony Fantana Agalloch marrow of the Spirit forever you "},{"id":"yS27JEUJXXc","title":"tUnE-yArDs - Nikki Nack ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tune yards wrecker Minuten yards record Nicky nack this is the third full-length LP from multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter merrill Garbus in this project as well as her bassist and frequent collaborator Nate Brenner and even though tune-yards is only a few albums deep into this project so far they have already built a really strong name for themselves and in a really distinct sound for one very lively layer drum beats that are pulled straight out of the African tradition the rhythms on this record are just so detailed they're rickety they're noisy but they're really nicely executed and tightly pulled together the grooves on this thing are are irresistible whether the drums are live or we're getting some drum loops or there are some synthetic drums being woven into the mix with a lot of the melodies of these tracks being brought by Merrill's voice or some light synthesizer accompaniment or Nate's bass lines and the lyrics on this thing I like a lot too I think there's a lot to like with what merrill Garbus is saying on this record sometimes the songs on here address some sort of personal struggle like on the opener find a new way or bring some societal satire to the table like real thing and there are plenty more moments on this record where the lyrics just bring pure humor or absurdity sort of like on the interlude here which is a weird narrated spoken word dystopian future that involves a cannibalism I guess I just like that this record just has so few lyrical inhibitions and as a result I think Meryl makes a lot of really bold and fun and memorable statements another thing I love about this record Merrill's voice it may actually be my favorite thing about this record she has so much personality pitch and power passion every time she harmonizes with herself with background vocals on this record it is near perfect and this happens whether she is very gently beautifully crooning on one of the ballots here on one of the slow burners or when she uses wild squawking on a track like rocking-chair where she's really digging in and you know really started to put a little bit of a rasp or just some grit on her singing - and and even though I think there is a lot of technical execution to her voice there's a lot of greatness to the way that she sings still her voices is not really for everyone it's a bit of an acquired taste I think it's just a very unusual tambour than I think many people are used to hearing women sing in even though Meryl has really beautiful and feminine falsetto the low end of her voice tends to run a little androgynous or maybe even sounds a bit like a bleeding sheep or like a large bird of some sort but despite these quirks Meryl is still a really great singer whose voice is incredibly soulful and as far as the songwriting goes on this LP I think it's super tuneful I think it's super tasteful much more than her last full-length LP who killed and I don't really think the songwriting disappoints on this LP either I think Meryl does a great job of bringing the usual level of oddity that goes into a tune-yards record but is able to bring some really great choruses and some very sticky melodies to the table - whether that be on some of the ballads like on wait for a minute which is one of the more beautiful songs on this record and Meryl does a fantastic job of sort of throwing the song off-kilter a little bit with these vocals that oh that sort of throw off the timing of the song then there's the song look around another great ballad on here but it's sort of in a weird nine eight time signature where a beat sort of gets thrown off on the back end of the bar and the hard hitting bangers you can call them or the the single worthy moments on here like water fountain I think are fantastic - or the song singko which I think has a bit of a disco influence to it like a bit of a post-punk thing going on and then there's the Kozar manchild on here which is one of the few moments in popular music where for the last track of the song you may hear the artist put the weirdest moment of the entire record right at the finish as opposed to like just a tear jerker or a really sad track to kind of bring the whole thing to an emotional climax and this is completely fine to me it fits in with the overall theme of the record unexpected surprises being relentlessly playful seeking to make truly fun poppy music that doesn't hold itself to a whole lot of standards because as memorable and as infectious as this record is and as you know hardcore it is into these verse chorus verse song structures merrill does a good job of finding way to throw a weird wrench into the works with most of the songs hear the sound of the record is really kooky for lack of a better word again sort of like on the song manchild where some of the effects playing throughout the track sound just kind of cheap or silly but this song like others on here is is is one of the more bold and political statements on the entire record with Meryl kind of staunchly declaring that you know this is my body no means no yes means yes ah it's one of the few moments on this entire LP that's just a slight overload and and this was also a problem on who killed it dropped a few years ago but it's not as great an issue for me personally you know there's not a moment on this record to me that feels like the song gangsta which I didn't want to get into why I don't like that track but still being bombastic and being in your face and being super colorful as part of what has made tune-yards one of the more unforgettable musical acts to break out over the past several years for sure Merrill can get a little annoying sometimes but she's also incredibly bold and creative so I went into this new record hoping that she would find more creative tasteful and novel ways to apply this weirdness that this project just seems to be bursting at the seams with and I think that happened in my opinion this is a great listen I think it's the shot in the arm that pop music needed this year the reminder to wake up and experiment a little bring some primal or unusual rhythms to the table just futz around with vocals a little bit or layering and instrumentation just go wild rather than be obsessively concerned with smooth sexy slick or trendy or nostalgic or politically correct or appealing this is Merrill's best set of tracks yet I'm feeling the light too decent eight on this thing Tran yeah boa if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana yards Nicky nack

new dead in the dirt album the blind hole after just a few IPS this Atlanta Georgia band is now dropping its full-length debut album on the infamous southern Lorde records a label that as you may know lately has been kind of dabbling in the sludgy er side of extreme music and this new record that they are presenting with dead in the dirt is a 22 track of fair and time-wise lands out around 24 minutes averaging just over a minute per track I decided to give this thing a listen give it a review even though I feel like labels like Southern Lord and maybe to an extent Deathwish records have been kind of saturating the loud rock scene with heavy sludgy hardcore punk records or grindcore records power violence records kind of like this but I feel like at least this album was interesting enough to catch my ear for the short amount of time that it did we've got mosh friendly friendly riffs all over this LP and D beat drums as well these groovier points on the album which are backed up with these drums are occasionally interrupted by syncopated blast beat drums and guitars so and of course feedback plays a pretty gigantic role on this album as well and of course we cannot forget the vocals which are a range of different extreme music styles we have death metal s growls on this LP some just straight-up hardcore punk screams maybe a few moments that these shrieks on this LP feel a little scream O influenced the recording and the mix the heavy bass on this thing and just the overwhelming compression not too overwhelming though but the compression on this LP just makes this album sound so massive and yet it's really clear too even though the guitars are so just and the drums are just so pummeling but very resonant to every single crushing bass drum kick and bloody crusty sledgehammer guitar riff come through as clear as a bell a lot like a wrecking ball just kind of careening through your bedroom wall not only do these faster spots feel clear not too blurry even though that does sort of happen to an extent because of how fast the band is playing but there are slower moments on this LP that feel nice as well like the 11th track or the closing track here - which have some simple but effectively dreary guitar parts as well as some very slow slow riffs on the closer here the low-end on these riffs gets so heavy that there's this tangible Rumble to the bass it's moments like this that actually kind of lead me to believe that the band does have some kind of idea of what subtlety in music is however it's not really often on display with this LP and that could be a good or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for if you didn't already know power violence and grindcore bands can kind of be a dime a dozen if you're looking for nothing more than kind of a completely unmemorable slugfest where over the course of a stereotypically short album you are beaten almost within an inch of your life but you don't really remember much of any of it sure there are bands like nails that are really catchy really groove heavy and just have an insane sound that is just more powerful than most in this genre and there are others like worm rot who I continue to sing the praises of who are a grindcore act but come through with some real absurdities and eccentricities to the music they're creating for sure dead and the dirt has come through on this record where they fantastic recording immense recording for this kind of music but sometimes I can't help but feel like a lot of what is presented here songwriting wise and and vocally - is just kind of very standard I don't really feel like the vocals are legitimately wild or furious sometimes just really kind of following in the footsteps of a lot of expectations coming from death and hardcore punk I definitely don't feel like the vocals here are as infuriated as what I've heard from either in fest or Charles Bronson and on the shorter tracks I do tend to feel like the bands writing especially on the riffs can be sort of unmemorable it's really the longer and Meteor tracks and then sometimes even the slower and sluttier tracks where I feel like dead and the dirts potential kind of comes through while they do have that physical intensity that you would want from some of the shorter tracks on here there's not much to them that I gravitate toward and while I wouldn't say that this record was boring to me I'm actually surprised that I stuck with it and wanted to listen to it again and again there's definitely something to be said for that but as I listen to this record more and more and totally enjoyed the recording enjoyed the ferocity enjoyed the intensity and I was looking for a little bit more in other places but I just wasn't finding that stuff meaning more creativity from the noisy sounds or the riffs or the vocals or just the song structures though this record is fast and enraging I just wish it pulled some more punches offered more surprises had a little bit more personality it's not a record that I see sticking with me for the long run but if you're into something extreme straight up and no BS then I would definitely give this thing a listen regardless of whether or not you agree with me on this review I'm feeling a decent strong 6 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it I want to give a shout out to Paul tec-9 fans I hear you Sammy Jerusha over at the rocket out blog I just did a video with him you can find a link

"},{"id":"zYx3RYer3V8","title":"Deftones- Koi No Yokan ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Deftones koi no yokan Deftones are a California rock band and one of the few to be considered in league with the new metal movement of the late 90s and early 2000s but are still taken pretty seriously in the music world and in retrospect their music was much more well developed and less hokey than a lot of their imitators who sort of came out of the woodwork once songs like change in my own summer hit the airwaves for sure Deftones had a heavy modern radio metal sound but they mix that with some very atmospheric beautiful and ethereal elements as well kind of bouncing back and forth between these two sounds on any given song now the band has kind of become one of those groups who has one awesome amazing album white pony that is constantly compared to every single thing they do afterwards and while the self-titled LP the band dropped in 2003 did not live up to the success of white pony it really didn't live up to it for more than the reason that it was not white pony I mean the usual amount of melody and just harmony and sonic Beauty that the band brought to the table wasn't there Deftones for sure we're trying to go heavier but they're really not one of these massive heavy badass bands in my opinion however in my opinion the band bounced back big-time with the album Saturday night wrist maybe my favorite Deftones LP post white pony Deftones were sounding as heavy as their self-titled LP but just newer more modern production had them sounding more lush than ever I mean that beautiful more atmospheric side of the band just got bigger and better in my opinion chinos vocals Tino Marino vocalist frontman the way his vocals are mixed on this LP the way they soar over the rest of the music just kind of gives me chills I mean to me the band's sound just grew to a galactic level on this album and they started incorporating some some elements of music outside of alternative metal the sounds of shoegaze as well as post metal post rock - I thought and I would say art rock - there were spots on here where I thought man has Deftones been listening to some Radiohead while this album is still you know definitively a Deftones album not something that I think is going to win over haters you know it certainly sounds like a Deftones album on the surface they were definitely working to just add in other elements and make an album that I thought was much more mature its albums like Saturday night risks that really justify the admiration that Deftones got as they plow through the 2000s you know because when it comes to alternative metal and when it comes to new metal it wasn't the the jump the FOB riffs and the vocal delivery and just the grooves with the catchy choruses that made the genre bad what made the genre terrible and stale is that many of the genres all-stars kind of refused to change and grow and evolve and when some artists did try to change they went even Kitsch here by trying to hop on the whole rap metal bandwagon now even though to me Deftones were sounding fantastic on this LP Saturday night risk wasn't a winner for every Deftones fan definitely not their heaviest in their catalog and some people do like them sounding heavier which is where kind of diamond2 eyes comes in which is by no means a bad album to me it's kind of the LP that their self-titled album should have been while it does come off much more straightforward much heavier much more riff oriented it does kind of have a certain level of finesse to it that I thought the self-titled record lacked but now with the band's new LP I kind of feel like we're getting a bit of deja vu here back in 2003 when the band had a really hard album coming out shortly afterwards they put out a much more atmospheric ethereal and experimental LP and now we have koi no yokan which in comparison to its predecessor like Saturday night wrist is much more atmospheric kind of ethereal but only a bit though while this LP is definitely not as heavy as diamond dies as far as Deftones atmospheric or more experimental side goes this LP doesn't really bring anything new to the table now that wrist and diamond dies are under the Deftones bell it kind of feels like Deftones as usual the LP opens up with the track swerve City which is the song that to me dishes out one of the most basic riffs that I've ever heard this band play there's nothing really extraordinary about it and the song kind of glides effortlessly from verse to chorus diverse with really no detail or tension or buildup the song romantic dreams is even more lacking in structure the verse and the intro is pretty good it's moody it sets a tone chinos vocals come off as very passionate but then this riff just comes out of nowhere that changes the entire feel of the song it really comes off as very pasted on and the chorus on the track is even more out of place the track in tune sees Deftones taking a kind of ethereal I'm aspheric approach slower it's a little more ballad like melodic I do like the chorus on that track but still that song and another track on here like graphic nature which is much more hard-hitting one of those Deftones tracks where you get kind of a weird quirky noisy riff that has a strange groove to it but then it slides into a very smooth chorus while these Tunes are by no means awful it's really just kind of Deftones by the numbers at this point and the song rosemary while I did like what the band was trying to do with that track definitely do something slower break things up it's the longest track on the entire LP there's a beautiful synth scape kicking the track off but as the band transitions from kind of one slow blobby moment to another the track does kind of lose mo mentum as far as highlights on this LP go certainly the track leathers stopped me in my tracks really one of the most hard-hitting and energetic songs on this entire LP and the way the riff goes and the lyrics the screamed vocals feel against that riff it's got a strong post-hardcore vibe to it I really am and I really do think the track may have the best chorus on this entire LP I love the vocal melody on this tracks song poltergeist has an extremely memorable riff to it that just sticks in my head really I mean came out at me on on this LP as I listened through numerous times in the song tempest while at first does kind of feel like your average depth own song and it is a bit quieter there are some just surprised explosive moments that really kind of catch me off-guard even as I listen to the track again and again and again it's it's a nice shock not to mention the track has another solid chorus and the song gauze has another solid chorus as well no mo nice down-tuned riff egde on that track and what I like so much about that particular song is that yeah while it is catchy it is straightforward there's a bit more detail in the song structuring on that track and to go back to kind of the complaint train the closing track on here really just kind of feels like another one of those stereotypically very quiet closers that you know wasn't particularly beautiful or pretty or even felt like a closing track it just kind of felt out of place on the rest of the LP because of how sort of underwhelming it was you know while this album wasn't terrible and to an extent I did like it I feel like the Deftones at this point on this album are kind of in a very comfortable spot definitely not working to do what they usually do and that is find some interesting ways to fuse other styles of music and just new sounds with their metal stylings again I feel like this LP goes back to that Saturday night wrist territory but this album kind of ends up being less expansive less atmospheric it's sort of the middle ground between wrist and diamond dies which may please some fans a lot but to me those two record our great and our totally representative of that more ethereal and just heavier side of Deftones for the band just make a record that feels like it's in the middle I don't know you know those extremes aren't there because of that because those aren't there the excitement is sort of you know tamp and I'm feeling a light too decent six on this LP what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what should I review next and that's it I hope you're well thank you for watching Anthony Fantana Deftones forever

new shelf the Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time for a review of the new honcho Jack album honcho Jack Jack honcho is it usually this bright in here I feel a little out of sorts it's been it's been a week is I'm not used to the lights again I'm not used to the lights this is a new collaborative record from two rappers based in the Atlanta area Travis Scott and the migos own quavo it would seem suddenly release projects from trendy rappers is kind of all the rage right now with recent releases from offset 21 savage and Metro boomin as well as future and young thug being some of the most talked-about records of 2017 and this will most likely be a larger and larger trend moving forward in 2018 because it's a lot easier to sort of build a record off of the hype of two brands colliding rather than working for years and years and years on a single project trying to fashion an entirely new sound or bring the trendy sounds you wrote in on up to a higher level which in my opinion is what Travis Scott did on his rodeo record however since then he doesn't seem quite as interested in taking risks and redefining standards as much as he is just kind of playing it safe and playing to expectations still though I did go into this thing expecting greatness especially considering how much I enjoyed without warning if that thing could just pull up out of nowhere and be pretty good then this for sure it's possible also one of my favorite artists of all time Ralph Steadman did the cover art for this thing I am a huge hunter s Thompson and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fan and the whole honcho Jack Jack honcho lore behind this thing is it's pretty intriguing too unfortunately this record is not quite as epic or as ambitious as I had hoped and while it is listenable it's its cardinal sin is actually that it's it's way too predictable and running the mill and bland it feels kind of like I'm listening to a handful of cool ideas that have somehow been stretched out past the 40-minute mark I mean despite the pretty dense list of producers on this thing the instrumental palette of this record ends a pretty uniform it's pretty much just one moody Spacey trap beat laced with sad hypnotic melodies after another mostly made for just vibing out there are some interesting sample choices throughout the project here and they're the ones that stood out to me or at least the ones that I recognized right away was you had a Mack DeMarco sample on the song how you feel there was a pretty nice Otis Redding intro on the first track to this thing and another thing about this project that pops is occasionally some of Travis Scots and kwai bose layered auto-tune vocal harmonies come off pretty heavenly prime example being the song go however not so much on the song best man which seems way too weakly improvised and off-the-cuff to actually sound like a legitimately written and conceived track and shows in a way just how little effort went into this thing overall but again back to the uniformity of this album it's really too uniform at points to really truly pick out any highlights from it because while there are some tracks on here I do enjoy more than others they're not really that much better in comparison there are a handful of tracks on this thing that barely past the two-minute mark don't really leave that strong of an impression Travis Scott sand Cuevas warbling auto-tune rap flows kind of bleed into one another and become more and more redundant as the project draws on the offset and takeoff features on this thing or actually like serious highlights here because they break up the monotony of this thing a bit and I get that there's not going to be a whole lot of lyrical substance to a project like this but still even some of the hooks which you really want the hooks on this thing to pop seem pretty phoned in from the yeah yeah yeahs on saint laurent mask - rapping about looking at other people in the eyes and touching the sky on i - i please miss me with that I get that this album mostly comes down to aesthetic but the aesthetic is only so interesting because there's only so much aesthetic here it doesn't change up that much I mean unless a certain instrumental bit or a hook on this thing blows up the there's not really much to talk about here I love the hook on st. you could see the road i blank do bash it dubai whips too much of alcohol we need more option but still at the end of the day all I can really say about this thing is is that it's just listenable it's merely listenable its pleasant its woozy it's not nearly as unique or as memorable or as finely written as some of me goes and Travis Scott's more recent work especially when comparing this to culture especially when comparing this to rodeo or some of the best tracks on birds sing in the trap for the most part Hunter Jack seems very wash rinse and repeat to the point where if you're not paying close attention to track after track after track of this thing you're gonna get deja vu it's almost kind of like getting lost in the forest on this thing not to mention that this collaboration seems more like just a mere series of tracks that Travis Scott has masterminded and quavo has merely featured on I mean you could plug a number of different trendy Auto crooning rappers onto some of these tracks and you would get roughly the same results I think the art the marketing the branding these two artists coming together was certainly smart and certainly has created a lot of buzz a lot of interest a lot of listens but this project is just very low on ideas it's very bubblegum it's very shallow and in my opinion exemplifies just how uninteresting some of these sudden collaborative records can be when you have a listening audience more interested in the names attached to the project than the substance of what's actually being recorded I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your dire view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just

Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review tonight self titled tonight EP tonight is the collaborative project of two up-and-coming electronic music producers from the UK Hudson Mohawke and Lunas I am much more at a bit of an edited I am much more familiar with the former than the latter and the five tracks on this EP are pretty much a mixture of I want to say trap rapped style hip hop instrumentals combined with some pretty recent strains of electronic dance music including future garage and dubstep and these styles are mixed together with the kind of unapologetic audacity that you would expect from somebody who is producing music like far into the future this EP really has no sense of oh these things are separate they should be separated they're different and that's part of the reason I love the internet because when a new sound or style kind of comes out of the blue comes out of nowhere before it even really gets a complete chance to really root itself into a single geographical area or culture everybody around the world is experimenting with it and really weird fusions and experiments can happen and turn into snowballing trends before people or critics really get the opportunity to stomp out the fire and start wagging their fingers screening gimmick gimmick so this is a pretty short EP is five tracks one after another it's just straight bangers bangers burners when I say the beats on this EP bang I mean it this is probably going to be the most hyped up 2012 based music you've heard there's not a single song on this EP that I could sit through sitting still to go back to the musical influences on this thing the trap rap hip-hop style is definitely the most prominent of all of them you do get the kinds of build ups and drops that you would expect from light a waka flocka flame beat or something like that you get those rattling high hats and snare drums that are just relentless at some points on this thing but some of the drops on this EP do have kind of a dubstep flavor to them and a few tracks on here kind of feature the very relentless vocal sample repetitions that you would expect more from an electronic music production coming from the UK which of course is rooted back in Juke and ghetto house if I have to have the lineage spelled out for me one more time I'm going to throw up in my mouth and have to swallow it because throwing up on camera is gross but on the track higher ground I really love how the vocal repetitions on that track are executed they are just so unrelenting it may be the most obnoxious thing you have ever heard for some people but for me it just really adds to the the energy of the track and the bass kicks on on this track and and others on this EP have very bold and clear hip-hop style to them as well the low-end on this EP is stellar you are doing yourself no favors by listening to this through like some earbuds or are just laptop speakers get a system you will most likely be able to pull out the influences that build the songs on this EP very easily what makes these guys different from other producers working with similar hybrids is how zany and just insane the colors and and samples and textures are that these guys work with on on this EP this is almost like psychedelic neon colored trap rap instrumentals the track buggin has really hard beats but they are slathered in reverb and they're like samples of this baby playing throughout the track going there all these bubbles popping in the beat too of course the scents are really weird there are all sorts of heavy the size was on the track higher ground to that I like a lot that sound like party horns burnt my remember and the track easy-easy has a load of weird crap mixed into the beat one sample kind of sounds like a car crashing which is played over and over I kind of hear a gun cocking these high-pitched vocal samples that sort of interject occasionally going yeah there are a lot of strange textures and samples on this EP but Hudson Mohawke and Lunas just take these sounds and they chop them loop them manipulate them with such an attention to detail how could the production shops on this EP not be recognized these tracks on this EP really do kind of appeal to those two sides of my brain and I love music like that that really not only just makes me react emotionally very quickly but I can also just sit back and think oh hmm derp derp hmm derp and there is a nice range of variation between these five tracks as well not only in terms of mood but in terms of just I guess style and sound some tracks rely more on vocal samples others just the beat and some synthesizers their moments like the first track that are pretty atmospheric and kind of Moody while others are very playful flamboyant experimental and just all-around engaging though this EP is short to me it is very satisfying I wish the first track were longer but that's really the only major issue I have with it I personally think it is very awesome and refreshing to hear electronic music like this that takes on such a heavy hip-hop influence and is so well produced but does not take itself too seriously it's just this really fun and catchy brand of neon colored aggression that I like a lot I'm feeling a light too decent 9 on this EP what do you think of it you have heard it love it hate it why let me know remember the good comment the great rate and only the strong subscribe tonight self-titled EP rapper [Music] "},{"id":"UWcxXnus0zY","title":"Danger Mouse & Daniele Luppi- \"The Rose With the Broken Neck\" TRACK REVIEW","y":3,"x":"it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's track reviews right now where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent purse waah major label this time around okay we're going to talk up a collaboration between Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi Rome this thing is basically a tag team effort between a producer who I don't think I need to tell you how prolific and involved he is in various projects and in Italian composer and the reason this came to be is because they both have a severe crush on Italian spaghetti western soundtracks it's kind of a sincere look back at the work of Ennio Morricone or Bruno Nicolai basically composers who made cinema in the 60s exciting not only that but Jack White and Norah Jones have been featured on a lot of tracks of this LP Jack white is on the one that we're going to listen to now linked below this video the rows with the broken neck from what I've read this album was five years in the making and I don't see it the effort definitely does show up in the sound of this LP in the dedication to vintage recording style vintage instruments and just the aesthetic I mean in terms of sonic qualities this music has been recreated almost flawlessly which is why my favorite moments on this album are the instrumental tracks which take me back to another time like when I was a kid watching TMZ or AMC you know those old classic movie on television but it's cool to hear that stuff done with a crystal-clear sound from 2011 I'm just kind of left asking where's the passion and excitement and melancholy that this kind of music is supposed to soundtrack I feel like this is all of the motions without any of the emotions in terms of music and Composition this thing really just lost me the generically strummed acoustic guitar the very sagging bass line that feels like it's afraid to emphasize any semblance of rhythm the very plainly placed who's coming from the chorus in the background the xeroxed and repetitive vocal melody and the fake sadness this song is drenched in is too orchestrated to feel real or impassioned plus I really really wonder is his Jack White's voice though I love his voice and I love his previous work is his voice the best vehicle for this style I mean really Jack White Norah Jones Italian style soundtrack music circa 1966 what but that's the thing about this LP though it is in love with this style of composition it's not that style of composition it's that sound dulled down made a little friendlier made a little more accessible for a new young western audience because I honestly couldn't see how how you could find this album exciting unless you're not familiar with this kind of music or if you haven't seen any old westerns this track and most of the album really are not doing it for me and normally I like revitalizations but when you do something like that you run the risk of creating a situation where the listener just wants to rip the CD out of the stereo and just go listen to the original and sadly that happened to me here I'd rather listen to a soundtrack from Ennio Morricone or Nino Rota or Bruno coleye I mean I guess it's worth a visit if you're a huge fan of any of the parties involved but if you're a soundtrack nut I don't see how taking the formula making it poppier making it more accessible and then throwing Jack White and Norah Jones on top of it is going to make you want to hear this more than once I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this thing I'm just totally this is not my thing and this is the album of the year for some people but I'm just moving in a completely different direction from this but what do you guys think especially the people who wanted me to review this what attracts you to this album do you love it why do you love it and if you hate it why do you hate it and what should I review next anthony Fantana roam forever "},{"id":"qy-tfRCoGGc","title":"Deadmau5 - While (1 Is Less Than 2) ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new deadmau5 record while one is less than two this is the latest LP from famed Ontario electronic music producer and DJ deadmau5 one of the biggest names in the EDM today ton of respect for the sky he's got quite a few singles that I like however I was not really looking forward to listening to this new deadmau5 record because in my opinion mainstream modern EDM music is not really an album genre and not that it couldn't be I just don't see a lot of artists taking that route to me a lot of the records that are coming out of modern EDM and especially deadmau5 as past records feel just more like compilations even though he's put out things that are legitimately compilations his main albums just feel like a collection of tracks that he made from this point in time to this point in time that may not necessarily sound that fantastic together everybody keeps saying the album is dead and yet the album continues to be like this that so many artists continue to play into and release despite the fact that some of these artists are playing music within genres where it's really singles that reigned supreme and that's the case for deadmau5 that's the case for modern EDM yum-yum-yum it's the live set and it's the single that really continues to advance his popularity and that's fine I know how fun a live DJ set can be deadmau5 actually tries to work to sort of recreate that experience on this record by giving people tracks that essentially mix and link all the songs on this double album together into an unbroken chain an interesting idea I think but still there were reasons I was dreading giving this record to listen for one it's over two hours long that's a lot of material coming from an artist that I don't really care for when it comes to the album experience the single and live experience is another story and I suppose the other thing I've dreaded is in the past I've also heard deadmau5 bring on some pretty terrible plastic and commercial sounding guest singers that I think completely ruin his tracks however this new record was not really the one-dimensional and arduous listen that I thought it was going to be Joel actually did his best to create a series of songs that are really free of awful guest singers the only real guest singer on this entire LP is Colleen D'Agostino of the band the material but even Joel's usual house style bangers are a little darker and noisier and glitchy er and industrial on this record a lot of these tracks typically feature some kind of very light airy melodic beautiful interlude - Joel is writing more dynamic material on this LP in a way it kind of reminds me of that John Hopkins album that dropped last year immunity a record that brought very tense creative hard-hitting house tracks and incorporated very organic live instrumentation like pianos and some strings as well I definitely feel an influence from this John Hopkins record but even more so I think there's quite a bit of Nine Inch Nails on this LP - there are some tracks on this record that are just Trent Reznor all the way from the downward spiral - Trent's more recent sound track work the song somewhere up here totally feels like a Nine Inch Nails instrumental and then there's the very eerie drone and piano on the song Kola can - and Joel isn't even afraid of making this influenced incredibly obvious by featuring two remixes that stick out like sore thumbs in the tracklist not in a good way of a Nine Inch Nails song and how to destroy angels song however I do find a lot of the other tracks on this LP to be very appealing and I think a lot of them actually divert away from the more commercial side of Joel's output like the song ride is lament which is a beautiful little electronic music composition it's a very pretty track and a song that has me thinking that deadmau5 really has his ear to some orchestral music on this record some film scores and maybe even a little I care because you do era effects twin-like on the song creep or a moment to myself my only major disappointment with this song is that it fades out so suddenly and a lot of the songs on second disc of this record do this side of the double album tends to be a bit more melodic and gentle not really setting a continuous groove or anything like that for a DJ set these two discs actually feel like two totally different albums while the first disc is fairly straightforward the second disc to me feel sort of like a soundtrack that doesn't really have a movie to string it together even the most hard hitting driving beat on this entire record from the song Mercedes feels like it could be set to visuals it feels very cinematic I believe there's even some audio of like a train station or a subway station being sampled into this track there is a very righteous chord progression on this track too that makes the song feel pretty epic some of what's on the second disc is pretty gripping but some of it I don't know kind of isn't there are a lot of guitar and piano interludes on the side of the disc that run a little bland maybe with the exception of the song Monday which takes a very familiar chord progression sets an incredibly sad melody to it and there's some singing robot vocals on the back end of the track it's sort of like a weepy cut that didn't make the new Daft Punk record or something it's nice to hear deadmau5 pushing into some more subtle territory but is the end result amazing not really however there are some very good bangers on the first disc of this album I think the opener to this disc is incredibly primal really dark rhythms on this track loved it the second track on here brings a really beautiful interlude that I think is great as I said I don't really care for the how to destroy angels remix but pretty much more than two thirds of the first disc on this record are just really great creative colorful house bangers for Joel a little darker a little more melodic a little more textured than usual for him some of these tracks are structurally surprising I think that Joel brings some great grooves and I love what he does when he usually brings an interlude into the fold with some of these songs too now some of them can run a little long like eight or nine minutes for me maybe Joel doesn't bring quite enough progression to the table to keep me on the edge of my seat with these songs from beginning to end but I still think he's coming through some of his best material yet on this new record I'm feeling a seven on the first disc feeling a five on the second disc cool cool transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it

internets giantest music nerd album review time this is why I love reviewing music because I get to talk about some bands that I love to a group of people who are as excited about music as I am so this review is of the new album join us from they might be giants a Brooklyn band started by singing songwriting duo John flans Berg and John Linnell the John's and easily these guys are one of the nerdiest bands on the planet but we know around here that being nerdy is a huge compliment in fact I think if it wasn't for my nerdiness I wouldn't enjoy songs about shoehorns or cranes or cows or beards or racist friends or mammals or skulls this bands lyrics and song subjects have always made them stand out but they've been paired usually with great pop hooks fantastic melodies bold experimentation and an unmistakable personality They Might Be Giants may not always come out with a great record but they have never made a faceless record even after all of the music that I've heard in my very short lifetime They Might Be Giants stuff still ranks as some of the most fun music I've ever heard for me it stops just short of being a joke for some these guys will be too absurd to take seriously but I need some absurdity in my life every now and then and they might be giants as the perfect place to get it for me now lately these guys have been putting out a lot of kids albums a lot of children's music but still it's not even like their adult music plays to an adult sensibility they're usually playing to the kid in every adult on the face of planet but if you are counting children's albums join us if I'm correct is they might be giants fifteenth studio album there's been a lot of evolution up until this point but I would say the band's recent stuff their recent adult albums have been pretty great at translating their eccentric personality through some modern production and a full band now it's not like they might be giants are going back to their roots on this LP or anything but join us really does come down to sounds and songs for me the songs are pretty on point not everyone is a hit but there's a lot of classic they might be giants on here some tracks are solid but very simple others with very difficult weird and complexly layered vocals that are singing in rounds spots that are almost hilarious spots where songs pause ridiculously esoteric lyrics like an old pine box or even moments that would probably be hilarious to everybody like the track when will you die yeah that's that's about wishing someone was dead and they're great hooks coming from both Linnell and flans berg like on the really jazzy protagonists or the the the small-scale rock anthem canada harry there could have been more experimental tracks on here though these guys are known for really working outside of the box and and being somewhat zany but i guess i don't get enough of that there are two different sets of lyrics going on in the left channel and the right channel on spoiler alert that's pretty funny dog walker has pitch shifted vocals which and i didn't care for it's different ground for these guys but there's a spot on here where john f-- Landsberg is narrating the voice of a raindrop on cloisonne where he just so you know not only is this thing not really pushing all that many boundaries for for they might be giants but to be honest the the sound here on this album really is not doing it for me at all now the sound isn't terrible it's not like it's it's terrible quality it's not like it's weird or anything like that I guess for the first time the instrumentation behind the John's songs sounds a little generic it's not like I mistook they might be giants for another band or anything like that but on a lot of these songs the the sound of the guitars the bass the drums and the keyboards they kind of feel like they could have been generated by like like any group to me on earlier records the guitars have sounded fuller the woodwinds and brass have sounded more eccentric this just doesn't sound like the usual level of color and quality join us kind of sounds like a live session recorded at a radio station or something like that not a fully completed and detailed and rich piece of studio work in comparison the else and the spine are way less flimsy sonically it's kind of like hearing my usual they might be giants but there's like a the thin film of dust on it that like I'm rubbing at it with extra listens and it just will not come off and don't get me wrong there are spots on here where the songs are so good that the sound the plainer sound I guess doesn't really bother me I mean is the band maturing are they trying to distance themselves from the from the quirky label that people always throw on to them are they trying to put together something that is simpler more skeletal something that's easier to execute live but yes to any of these questions on paper sounds great it sounds really good but if it's gonna make an album like join us I mean I'm gonna have to advocate being immature being quirky and throwing all of the complications into overdrive so I'm feeling of 5 to 6 on this record it's not terrible but it's definitely not going to go down in history as one of my favorite They Might Be Giants albums but if this is the first time you're hearing of the band or if for some reason you've heard of them before but you haven't checked them out don't let this album deter you if you do check it out and you don't like it if you're going to get into these guys their first for albums you cannot go wrong they sit proudly in my personal collection especially Lincoln if you haven't heard this album please check it out to not like it is to not like fun but if you were they might be Giants fan let me know what you think of this LP love it hey that why do you feel the same way I do about the sound of this record and if not let me know and what do you think of the songs on this thing - thank you for watching Anthony Fantana They Might Be Giants forever "},{"id":"d8kP_uGxNfc","title":"Giles Corey- Giles Corey ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hey guys Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd as you may already know that hurricane that hit Connecticut has already passed and unfortunately we withstood some damage powers out unfortunately probably not going to be able to make any vids for a while so yeah what you doing in the derrick I hate you I hate you so much we're gonna do an album review of this self-titled Giles Corey LP okay I suppose this is a pretty good album to be reviewing right now post-hurricane Giles Corey this album I've had a physical copy and a copy of the book that comes with it for four months now I was sampling it here and there and coming back to it and it just wasn't like clicking you know it wasn't clicking with me not because it was bad but it's really hard to digest piece of audio there's a lot to think about a lot to consider even if you're not taking the book into account there are moments on here of of noise and drones and field recordings and also shoegaze e-rock and acoustic ballads and gospel like dirges with soaring background courses the entire LP is soaked in this really eerie atmosphere and stylistically it's like all over the place but I would expect nothing less from the guy who's behind this album Connecticut musician Dan Barret his biggest project have a nice life has been just as varied in how many flavors it takes on from post-punk to noise and drone to industrial rock and I think the projects outside of this that Dan's been involved with have been pretty interesting too novel ear for one which saw him diving into dark ambient music into black metal as well it wasn't as well-received does have a nice life but if you're in a depressive black metal like SAS there or something like that it's at least worth checking out now there are a lot of tracks on this thing that are not about having a catchy tune or anything like that it's more about atmosphere noise just texture style you've got to take some of the songs on here and maybe this entire album as an experience or maybe a full spectrum or picture of a certain emotion or feeling for the most part I thought this album was pretty creepy pretty haunting and it all starts off with with the haunting presence first track that song to me sounds like listening to souls from beyond the grave screaming lyrics against a really somber piano phrase and there's this like this rising noisy deafening sound kind of just like swelling up in the background in it and it's slowly like choking the entire song it's like indescribable it's like a field recording from another dimension this whispering vocal comes up and just sort of introduces itself as these larger-than-life bass drums or pounding pounding pounding like knocking on this gigantic gateway or something and it's like all of a sudden the door just opens just flies open and all these horrible like mutilated faces are screaming all at once against this organ pumping out these sinister chords it's pretty disturbing and sick and the whole track is followed by this really tortured tortured screaming and slamming hands against a piano it's pretty freaky this song and a lot of this album is like bringing Dan's capabilities as a singer-songwriter together with a lot of the experimental sounds and drones from that novel ear record there are other tracks on this LP that have kind of similar swells like I'm not going to do it it's kind of like being suffocated really slowly by depression there are some more accesible moments on here too kind of had these more experimental ones out I know I'm more partial to the experimental tracks on this album but I don't think everybody is going to feel that way so luckily there are some acoustic ballads on here that remind me a lot of grizzly-bear actually that album yellow house in that you've got these very kind of straightforward acoustic songs but they're just matched up with it with a sea of reverb and background vocals empowering and just making it seem bigger than what it really is but in a way it also kind of reminds me of Mount Airy it's produced in a way that's messy but kind of lends it this unique style that you're not going to find anywhere else Dan Barrett's production style like on have a nice life like on novel ear some of the sounds on here that get louder really over modulated kind of overblown some of the guitars feel kind of thin and tinny a lot of vocals in the background when they're being multi-tracked and singing in courses they assemble a little lazily and like I said about the reverb there's tons of it but enough music translates through it so I can actually hear what's going on you know it's not like I'm losing the song in the reverb plus Dan loads this atmosphere with lots of subtle textures and just interesting sounds that I pick up a little bit more of them every time I revisit this album it's like an Easter egg hunt or something now this book is kind of like a different story a lot of pages a lot of text a lot of pay pictures as well like previous projects dan has been involved with themes of this album revolve around depression death suicide but there's sort of an added element of the occult and the afterlife and ghosts involved with this a lot of the pages on here kind of in a way look to give the reader some kind of existential crisis but when it's not doing that the the words on this thing kind of followed the exploits of someone I assume Dan made up because when I google this guy pretty much all links go to this album the man's name is Robert for like any good piece of fiction this book takes what is not real and routes it so deeply into what Israel that it kind of blurs those two worlds so in a way I'm convinced he's real his obsession with the afterlife death and the occult they're real I'm convinced that the hood wearing cult that he led into the woods that was real there are points on this book that reference back to particular spots on this album which actually kind of made this LP go from being creepy - like frightening for me when Dan was talking about the vores head device which is this weird hood that I alluded to earlier which is supposed to be giving members of this of this cult like visions connection to the afterlife something like that and Dan explains wearing this hood and getting axe to the piano and just like having this freakout session that got recorded to tape and then it's thrown onto this album Plus for me it was pretty great to get a look into the lyrical side of this album by looking at the pages of this book like the song spectral bride is pretty much about being so depressed that you want to commit suicide but you have this loved one that you've left behind that you want to be with romantically so you know you die but you're still with that person as like a ghost the context and the ideas that this book brings they're fine they're good I think they empower this album a lot I like the fact that this album is named after Giles Corey who was a colonial American who was killed during the Salem witch trials and was basically put to death via getting crushed by stones because he refused to plead guilty or not guilty to the witchcraft charges he was faced with and on this album and in this book Dan pretty much puts himself in Giles place but instead of being crushed by rocks he's being crushed by this story about Robert war ideas and obsessions with death in the afterlife and and suicide and of course depression to all of that is crushing down on him now is this book necessary to enjoy this album probably not on some level I think a lot of people are going to enjoy this album even without the book but we're living in an age where for some reason people are more interested in what goes on behind the scenes with albums and and just sort of what makes albums tick and what inspires albums if you really want to see what made this album what it is the book is a must sonically I think the only issues that I really had with this LP there were a lot of points where I was hearing like synth horns and that's like possibly one of my least favorite sounds on the planet I feel like the last track on the album there could have been a little bit more to it it could have been a little bit more climactic or something but I love this thing I love the concept I love the way it made me feel because after I read the book after I sort of took the album in it just kind of made me feel paranoid about everything so if you're in the mood for an album that is going to depress you a little bit yeah I think it's a pretty ambitious work and would love to know what you guys think of it if you've heard it love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next feeling a light to decent eighth on this thing loving it I know I've been pretty positive in my in my most recent reviews and it's because I have a lot of music that's worth praising don't you think Anthony Fantana Giles Corey forever you [Music] "},{"id":"D5vrzzxGxwc","title":"J. Cole - KOD ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hello everybody beefin e-flat tano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new J Cole album kod this is the fifth full-length album from the North Carolina rapper and what can really be said at this point that I or somebody else hasn't said already about J Cole supposedly woke rapper who does mainstream numbers and yet somehow falls short of his full potential with nearly every release given his track record I'm not really sure if I expected that much different this time around though I know at the end of the day J Cole is is smart enough to do better he's talented enough to do better so my fingers are always crossed even if his hardcore fans seem like they're into where he's at right now they don't want him to change and maybe are creating less motivation for him to do so so this thing is a pretty tight it's a pretty trim album it's 12 tracks that breeze by relatively quickly and it's it's like 44 minutes or so kicks off with an intro with a lot of Spacey in strim teh ssin female narrator going on about how the audience needs to choose wisely choose wisely on the journey of life honestly it's not really that exciting or inspiring of an intro and knowing J Cole I I know that a lot of what this lady is saying is just gonna boil down to just don't do the wrong thing just make sure you do the right thing so we transition into the track kod the title track of the album which is actually a decent tone setter for the record in that it's a kind of sparse somewhat eerie trap instrumental a little unsettling but only vaguely hooks that barely sound like hooks and don't transition sonically or emotionally all that much from the verses a kind of underwhelming vocal delivery and a general lack of focus across the songs themselves which given the album cover here and given the title of the album which is like kids on drugs or king overdose you would think that this track specifically would be some kind of grand statement on substance abuse and diction but some of the first bars he hits audiences with on this track is just him complaining about people wanting them to have more features on his records which just kind of comes off as bitter at the end of the day I mean I dig the overall vibe in the style of the track but once again Cole fails to pass the expectations test and I don't mean merely my expectations or the expectations that his audience puts on him by hyping him up I mean the actual expectations he puts on his own tracks with the song titles with the album cover with the messaging in the hooks because across J Cole's discography I feel like there's always been Jay Cole and then there is the reputation of Jay Cole as this mega woke lyrical miracle with this laser focused intensity on whatever song topic or profound truth that he's dropping in a song when in actuality he's never truly been that at least not for longer than a song or two I mean there are certainly examples of that on this record but photograph is not one of them the song is basically an anthem for every Instagram creeper out there who falls in love at first sight with a picture of a woman totally overthinking the situation as if it's a situation at all what should I say I hope I I hope I can be this person's boyfriend it's a kind of creepy track when you get to the core of it it's sort of obsessive like that weird little I'll keep this one to myself line-in in the hook is I don't know it's it kind of makes the hairs on my neck stand up not to mention that the the subpar singing that Cole lays out of this track too but the singing on this track is nowhere near that of kill Edward the album's only featured artist and he's on the album twice I pretty much like the messaging in the sentiment of the song Cole cutting people out of his life who have a toxic impact or are using him not just in the present but also reflecting on instances of this in the past but truthfully it's it's one of the most hideous sounding songs on the entire record good Madrid good misspoke good bird big goober drunk good Madrid also this bar on here about not fantasizing about murder because he's saying but he can't get away from this desire to hurt this person who he has in mind which like what what do you even call that the song ATM is quite possibly the first truly enjoyable moment on the album first track that really delivers any kind of thrill even with the beat not being the hardest even with the hook being as a redundant as it is it's really Cole's delivery and fast flow and passionate performance that ends up making this song I mean it's not the smartest message or the most grandiose truth bomb or anything but the track essentially gets to this idea of of greed and materialism and not being able to take all these things that you gather on to the other side Cole also paints a character portrait of this person who benefits profits off the misfortune of others which is easily the more interesting segment of the song a lot like with Cole's last record I feel like I'm kind of getting hints I'm getting like references to an idea of a concept or something like I'm kind of getting flashes of this individual who is is being represented on the front cover over here but Cole doesn't follow through enough to kind of fill this record with I don't know enough internal monologues or points of view from this person to really stitch a cohesive project together where I don't know we kind of get to know this individual or whoever the heck he's supposed to be again on an album Cole has a potentially great point he could be making but it's convoluted by him trailing off into other directions just a general lack of focus the song motivate it's Pleasant while it's on but it's easily one of the sleepiest motivational songs ever it's confusingly short as well it's not one of the worst tracks on this thing but it's essentially a very taxing creepin anthem with Cole rapping about temptation and being unfaithful and and being a Mac when he's out on the road he's his real opinions and motions on the matter seem kind of vague and at the end of the day he just kind of seems Moody because he can't have his cake and eat it too and speaking of taxing the song brackets is is literally about tack says another painfully boring track on this album not just aesthetically but also structurally the beat is pretty drab and the song features these multiple vocals snippet passengers that take way too long to make Jay Cole's point however the second verse on this record is quite possibly one of the most salient on the entire album I mean while it might seem far-fetched that j.cole is rapping about an app on your phone where you pick where your tax dollars go his bars about neighborhoods being taxed and simultaneously not seeing the benefit of that taxation are pretty strong talking about schools not making the grade talking about roads not being fixed the song once an addict interlude is another high point on the album the song features all of these bars about Jay Cole's mom when he was younger in the throes of alcoholism he's about to go to college he's not really knowing what to do about it he wants to run away from it it's easily one of the most powerful tracks he's ever recorded period really projecting that pain through his pen my only letdown with the song is that it's categorized as a mere interlude when it's just as long and much more entertaining than a lot of the other songs on the record the song friends right after is a moment on the record where Cole goes deeper into the topic of drug abuse and honestly Cole is not nearly as annoying or preachy on this topic as I thought that he might have been going into it he's certainly not on the level of a Russ but what ends up kneecapping this song is not only another set of awful vocals from kill Edward but also that there's a great build-up but not much in the way of payoff because while in one breath Cole is going in on this track against politicians poverty traumatized kids people with short-sighted goals like oh I'm gonna be on the Pistons I'm gonna be a basketball player Cole says on this track that he would need 20 CDs to essentially get to the core of of everything rotting America from the inside out so he takes all this stuff he rounds all of it up only to put a cherry on top and tell the audience meditate don't medicate and I don't know maybe that message turns heads at a local dare program or a food co-op but a lot of this stuff is systemic and in meant to ruin people's lives and create a class of citizen that is caught in the cycle of drugs crime poverty drugs crime poverty drugs crime poverty with our current drug war and how we treat addiction in this country the song windowpane I I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with this track I mean the only thing truly awful about it is the title beyond that the sentiment of the song is essentially coal saying I'm telling you guys all this good stuff I'm telling you what to do and what not to do and none of you are doing what I say none of you are listening to me which is a little desperate and it's most likely connected to Cole's ego in some way but I do feel his frustration and his anger at just a lack of positive change I agree with nearly everything he's saying and citing on this track but the thing is at the end of the day the human race is flawed and people are going to make bad decisions bad personal decisions you can't just merely wrap it or nag it out of your audience it's it's not going to happen all one could really hope for is that we create a better society where these bad decisions are less likely to happen and that we have better social safety nets for when these decisions occur again it's not that I hate Cole for trying it's one of the few things that's truly admirable about him the issue is at the end of the day that a lot of these problems are bigger than him or really any of us individually and far beyond his reach even as a platinum-selling rapper I also love Cole's hypnotic flow on this track the refrain on this cut is pretty cold-blooded as well Cole talking about wanting to see his relatives on the other side hurt the man who heard his mom and then we end things off at the track in 1985 named after the year that J Cole was born and a lot of people have been freaking out about this cut over the weekend saying oh it's it's a little pump dish he's dissing little pump a little pump responded oh my god and this thing is not even a diss track it's an advice track sure maybe the tone of the song is a little patronizing but J Cole is smarter than a lot of the people who he's talking about and he's right this song features not only some of the smartest observations on the entire record but some of the smartest commentary on rap right now we have how some of these new kids could be making more money in the industry spending their money so that they have more longevity not only in in their music careers but also in life telling these kids not to fall prey to the trends that they rode in on pulling them back into the ocean after the tide you know rolls back and also how clueless white kids consume their music and view it as a window into authentic black culture and as bland as Jay Cole can be sometimes what he says on this track about how long he's going to last in the industry is most likely true as long as he continues to provide this specific thing that appeals to this niche audience that loves them so much at the end of the day kod is a lot like many other kool records there's a lot of heart and there are some very good ideas here but there's little to no ambition on this thing and Cole clearly thinks that just because he's past the very low bar of well I'm not making mindless crap he can merely come through the record that overall sounds very low energy very low structure very low everything and it's all gravy and I just don't get this insistence on a lack of features not that I think a flood of pop rappers would make this record any better but maybe some more outside input on his music would allow Cole to collaborate with people who could I don't know fill in some of his musical blind spots of which there are quite a few not really sure what else to say I feel kind of indifferent yet again on another Jake whole album kind of torn because there are highs and they're lows here and really that's what Jay Cole just kind of tends to do I guess I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the

Shawn Cee","y":6,"x":"I got scratched hi everyone scratched and scratched and oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's hot it's sweaty out it's muggy it's humid stop I just I just won't fall to be here and it's time for a review of the new ace Hatford project still striving ASAP ferg is a New York rapper a part of the ASAP mob he dropped a flawed but very underappreciated album in 2013 trap Lorde the album's sound took cloud rap down a very dark and moody path it had this pristine Sheen and atmosphere surrounding it that was just like really beautiful it was chilling and it matched very well with the grit and the aggression of the instrumentals and Ferg voice and lyrics and again Ferg's voices delivery very deep almost kind of goofy in a way but not so goofy it took away from his lyrics just enough to make him sound pretty unique and eccentric and kind of off-the-wall unhinged especially as he would pull out like this really weird singing voice girl remember sing my song like there were a lot of really cool unique quirks about this project that had me excited for what Ferg was gonna be doing in the future then down the road he would drop his always strive and prosper album which in my opinion was an utterly awful project one of the worst attempts this decade of a rapper trying to sound as commercial as possible and with an album so bad how could a SAP 4 bounce back in one breath it seems almost like a feat but in another I mean he's really kind of made it easy for himself I think he'd really have to be trying to make a terrible album on purpose to make a worse record so a while back he announced this new mixtape over here he dropped a lot of singles in preparation for it most of which I just thought were okay I was hoping that they would all come together and just be greater than the sum of their parts as a whole project here now of course I'm not reviewing this project by myself I've brought on fellow YouTube music critic and reviewer Sean say who has some very solid reviews and reactions on his channel which is linked in the description box check it out and we are essentially going to talk it out on this album hash it out on this album here we go ashen and here we are through the magic of the internet with mr. Sean C and we're gonna be talking about this new ASAP ferg mixtape Sean what did you generally think of this project was it better than the last album was a good overall what did you think so kind of coming into this one I was expecting more of the whole trap lore thing for kind of rules over that domain and giving you know music that's really trap based and that has beats that are kind of you know represent this urgency or this form of greediness in my opinion so that's kind of what I know him for what I want him for on the last album I think it was the always strive and prosper maybe I think that was that's what it was called yeah I didn't feel like that was representing him as well as he kind of wanted it to I feel like it was trying to be too you know mainstream to appeal to too many did maccer - too many demographics but with this one I thought it was good I didn't think it was you know crazy it was elements from trap Lord and from his most recent album or project in this one some things that I like something that I you know some that I didn't really care for some that I did but for the most part I think it was a decent project I wouldn't say that there's I don't see more people getting more than like five maybe six tracks out of this that they're gonna enjoy and keep coming back to in comparison with always strive it's definitely grittier it's definitely a bit of a return to form you know it's it's nowhere near as disappointing as as his last album was room seems like he's playing to his strengths a little bit more the production is more atmospheric again the lyrics and the beats are you know harder and more aggressive again doesn't seem like he's trying to sell you on you know too many sweet very commercial very radio-friendly hooks or anything like that but I think the project ends up getting weighed down in just the fact that there are so many freakin features on this thing yes like so many of which I don't think really kind of play too Ferg strengths like as much as I do like a little yachty feature here and there I'm not really sure if Ferg and yadi are the best combination I'm not really sure if Ferg and nav are the best combination the playboy cardies feature while I do like some of his features and I like a song here and there and I understand sort of the connect from the ASAP mob there his verse there was so throw away on madman yeah it was a computable moment and the song just kind of fizzled out directly afterwards as soon as like he sort of dropped out of his verse yeah which which is really unfortunate because there were actually some great features on this thing I mean the matress remix is fucking insane yeah that's right I love that one that song is so insane it's so awful think about that track though that's really funny is there's a bit of a Chanel vs. great value or Walmart thing going on because Ferg and rocky are like this should know they're going back and forth they're giving each other really great you know setups and then we get to Dex and rich the kid I think hmm and then it's just like you oh you're you're kind of the great valu version of what I just listened to but the whole song and you know and it still works I still like it a lot and I didn't think I would know the other posse cut the East Coast remix was really good too you know Snoop Dogg brought it up really well in the back I thought it was it was good I got did you move past that one for now because I got like a really bad rant for that one well I really like those cuts you know I was really happy to see Cameron on here you know because he's sort of like a New York throwback that I feel like a lot of Millennials don't really know about or appreciate these days the whole Dipset thing and he sounded really good on rubberband man which had a hook and a beat that was insane like I went absolutely nuts when I heard that beef like that was honestly between that track and trap and a dream I thought that like this is it he's like actually going to really deliver here I know there are some songs coming up later that suck but ok I'm gonna convince myself before this thing is even over that this is gonna be one of his better project yeah that's what I would like to do yeah and there's you know there's this middle part you know that you kind of have to get over until you really get to something great again and really do it like I said it's it's cool I think for like I said he's really I agree with use playing to his strengths more on this project definitely more than he was on the previous but he just comes across as like really formula and even with the way he uses his features it's like you know that little yachty you know that playboy car you know that made in Tokyo are not you know rappers who are known for lyrics or rappers who that who need their own verse on a song so for me it's like you're not giving them tools to kind of be desirable on these tracks you're just kind of making them be formulaic along with you when you could easily have real I'm just throwing them on there for the future just doing them on there for the attention and pretty much does and even the ones that are strong on here like the Dave East one and like I said I'd like the Cam'ron verse but it's not that much that sticks with me I think Cam'ron is a little bit more debatable because more people you know are gonna be invested in that I don't know as much about Cameron so I might not have a strong of a connection to him as others may but like the Davies one it's cool but then I'm like am I gonna listen to this again not really you know there are other tracks on there that kind of fall into that same formula and then the nav one is just like I was driving when I heard that track and I came to a red light and then naps part you know comes on and I just got like really depressed like out of nowhere like he started rapping and I'm like okay this is okay this is this isn't that bad you know because it's more of an upbeat it's kind of different from the rest of the album the vibe is a little bit more chipper I guess you could say it's a bit smoother and trying to be yeah somewhat sexier but yeah yeah and then I'm listening to and then nav comes in and I'm just like I stopped the car at the red light immediately and I literally asked myself that sounds like what am I doing with my life because he he gave me like the most like the most basic boring vocal pattern everything that's whistle blasts are similar yeah on this one it's just like this track is just like it's made for you to give some sexy energy if you want to call it that and it's just like where is it at it and I'm just not like usually an angle Ferg plays - well unless he's kind of being like sort of silly or ridiculous with it even now though I just would have you know something it just it just didn't give me anything that I thought of me he sounded like a baby robot on that track hello you know you're right she sounds like that almost tracks but on this one I just mean knowing that nav has that like super repetitive thing going on it had me stopping in my tracks like what am i doin my life like I kind of need to question some things so I don't end up like this guy so it made me like you know after I got done diagnosing myself with clinical depression I moved on with the track and it was like okay you know he gives me more that the struggle bars like the overuse I'm over the grass and the snakes are laughs it's just I just can't get with it not on that track no I agree and you know like you were saying about the Davey East track I mean me personally I'm not huge on Dave East as far as like listening to his solo stuff and he didn't really grab me on these two features that he had on here either to sort of go past the nav track you know his feature was obviously lackluster but in my opinion that was the worst track on the project and not just because of him I mean I think Ferg brought some of his most tasteless and most ridiculous lyrics on the entire project on that one song like you said famous decks it seemed like he was just kind of here to fill in a blank fill in a spot just kind of grab attention for people to just be like okay Dex is on this I'm a Dex fan so I'm going to check it out and again all the features kind of weighing this down it's such a shame because in my opinion the song that had no features in the middle of the whole thing Plain Jane was one of my favorites like he dropped that line in the track or he said he would fuck someone's bitch ironically and I don't know I was laughing I was just laughing my ass off at that line and I thought the hook was super smooth and catchy too home dude was like okay yeah okay so that was the that was the three 6 mafia reference track I was like because that's the one that had me I was like am i enjoying this more because of the reference or am i enjoying it because Burke is really giving me a lot and I think he did good with that truck as well I'm not gonna have like I said him like making music by himself I think I'm surprised it like I said he was able to carry a good amount of these tracks you know by himself like yeah even the tango song on here was I liked his you know relationship that he kind of depicts his relationship with the yams mom and yeah says by laying in his bed he somehow can get you know visions you know from what yams would normally do so that there's no moment on the record I thought that the production sort of fit the tone of the track to really well you know and like you said you know he does carry a lot of the record even though there are a lot of features on this thing because there aren't a lot of moments on here that I could think of where he's really super outshined you know obviously on the East Coast remix obviously a little bit on the mattress remix because there's so many people there but he does so well on the hook that it's like he kind of brings you back and kind of demands attention throughout the entire track but yeah you know I I just wish that he had given us another verse on a lot of these tracks rather than just trying to pad this album out with a bunch of hyped features in order to get people to listen to it and I don't know just in the end come out with a more solid project because at the end of the day a lot of these songs really are not as good as they could be just because I don't feel like everybody's giving their all or everybody appearing on this album really kind of fits or compliments in style and like you said earlier you know that there there is an element of him being kind of formulaic here not only in the sense that the way he plugs guests into songs over and over and over it's pretty much the same you know it's the same setup it's the same structure it's the same formula but also on top of that as much as I do appreciate that he's playing to his strengths once again on this project I feel like instead of kind of progressing past what he did on trapped Lord he's kind of just gone back to what's familiar and what's easy for him because of how always strive and prosper kind of blew up in his face a little bit so now he's just kind of like stepping back and just kind of getting back on what kind of works what's obvious what he knows his fans like him for but at the speed that rap is moving right now it's almost like the sound that he's delivering here at some points is like a couple years behind the curve you know yeah like I could definitely see that and I think like I said there's just not enough nutritional value to this album or to this project to get people to you know keep coming back to it like most of the time there's an more project you're like okay well I'd go to this thing for this reason but there aren't more reasons to listen to it then there are not good reasons to listen to it in my opinion that's like when I'm listening to this it's like a really easily consuming project you can take a few parts out of it and you shit the rest of it out pretty much and that was pretty much my biggest problem with the East Coast remix now for this one is like okay beats great come in Ferg is given great delivery great energy busta rhymes perfect opener after him we get further again switching up cadence and flows and giving lyrics and dropping bombs on my alright this is great then we get a sub rocky pretty cut you know it's not the greatest rocky verse but it's good it's doable I don't really like the part where he complains about people complaining about him having clear skin and there's another part I like the bar in there before that though that was a weird line to me that was red light to me that almost read like he was talking about other women being jealous of his clear skin the way I phrased it in my opinion the way that I read it when I heard it so yeah like that it was a little strange it like kind of threw me for a loop first like I got back into it cuz his flow was really nice yeah he rolls in the day beast really well and so at this point in the song I'm like alright this is great you know if I had to be in heaven right now this would be trap heaven and obviously for being you know the trap lore which I've got travel or whatever you want to call them you know and I'm alright this is great instead of me running through a field of you know dandelions and freshly cut grass and everything like that I wanted run through a field of money and instead of trees in nature in the background there's girls twerking on poles that endlessly go into the sky freshly on my freshly poured lean fountains everywhere right in the most natural part of this thing right is this the Sun the Sun is in the sky is shining bright uh-huh but wait here comes the solar eclipse but no it's not a solar eclipse it's fucking French from Montana coming to ruin the track again and then when he does get on the track woody what does he decide to do he decides to chastise other rappers for using familiar flows he has none himself he has no like versatility no no no nothing about him is like entertaining on this and then from that point on the track it just goes downhill for me because the hot my high is ruined you know he ruined it and then Rick Ross is really slow with his delivery it's just kind of slow as the rest of it down and then Snoop Dogg I don't know if you seen the meat in the music video for this Snoop Dogg's part in the music video is hilarious because he's given like a snapshot of filter angle I thought that was hilarious I thought that was a brilliant part of the video but I loved the song but everybody after Dave used to getting cut out for me I'll agree you know the weak links and the chain there are easily French Montana and Rick Ross I mean I thought French sort of sounded aggressive but I don't pay too much attention to his lyrics when I hear a French Montana feature to be fairly to be completely honest however you know to sort of have him and have Busta on a remix to me again kind of reads like Ferg going back and just repeating himself once again because Busta was on a remix from his last album trap Lord or his you know his debut album yeah I thought it was decent but nowhere near is kind of surprising and exciting unfortunately his trap wordless trap Lord was even though I wanted it to be that for the most part I'm feeling like a decent two strong six on this thing probably not much more to be fair all right well same same kind of feeling like I said it's it's decent nothing that much to it I had more you know issues with this so probably threw about a four on it okay all right thank you very much Sean for coming on and talking with me about this tape you guys can find a link to his YouTube channel down there in the description not only does he have some solid reviews and reactions but God his his his thumbnail game makes me a makes me pretty jealous and pretty jealous of the students thumbnail game okay we're gonna leave it there Anthony Fantana Sean C ASAP ferg still striving forever "},{"id":"K0OKHJ3K8qs","title":"Pond - Man, It Feels Like Space Again ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"what day is it how long have I been in here hi everyone Woodsen e bangtan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pond album man it feels like space again these guys are a perfect psychedelic rock and pop band they have been added since the late 2000s and when it comes to that vintage psychedelic sound garage rock they really know these genres these styles like the back of their hands they have a lot of reverence for these musical movements you can tell this just from the fact that the cover of this new album over here resembles very closely the front cover of the Big Brother and the Holding Company album cheap thrills also this band has numerous connections to another Australian psychedelic music heavyweight tame impala namely the fact that Kevin Parker used to be in the band the mastermind of tame impala and also known for his part in melodies echo chamber but he also has produced numerous pend albums even this new one right here but pond also pulls quite a bit of stylistic influence from their contemporaries as well bands like Flaming Lips the falsetto vocals moaning very faintly amongst a very generally psychedelic collection of rock instrumentation expansive expressive guitar solos some pretty keyboards some chaotic jams remind me quite a bit of Flaming Lips on records like beards and wives and denim as well as hobo rocket occasionally the band's jams might get a little too chaotic for a truly vintage sound or their experiments might just get a little too weird but for the most part I find pod to be revivalists when it comes to that psych pop psych rock sound however I've never really been super wowed or impressed with their vocals or lyrics or songwriting they aren't terrible they're not god-awful it's not like they put me off of enjoying upon record but I've never really listened to a pond record all the way through feeling completely fulfilled I've always left wanting more and that is also the case for this new LP Oh over here even though I think in a lot of ways this album is a bit of an improvement upon what they've done in their past releases this record features a change of pace that really perked my ears up for one there are numerous tracks on this album that feature very punchy warm just very compressed funky drumbeats and grooves something I would expect instead on like an unknown Mortal Orchestra record and with the just very glossy pretty enveloping synthesizers all over this album I actually think Pond takes a step towards sounding a little bit more like tame impala and there are some moments on this record where I'm reminded of some of the dreamier contemporary indie rock and pop acts coming out of the US right now like Smith westerns or even Mac DeMarco on the second track here Elvis's burning star if you've heard Mac DeMarcos past two albums the vocals on this track are just a dead ringer for his delivery and with the very driving bass line and the heart beats on this track it's like I'm almost listening to a more upbeat version of DeMarcos usual shtick and then with the song is on I feel like I'm listening to a kind of a trippy surreal watery Strokes there are some kind of stiff drums on this track some buzzing guitar leads that sound like they could have fit in very nicely into the room on fire repertoire it's one of the catchy ER tracks in the track listing here and I'm loving the kind of stuttering glitchy vocal edits on this song as well as some of the strange serene and ethereal interludes the song just dips into so suddenly they really play with momentum very nicely in this track and that's the thing while pond doesn't have the best vocals or the best songwriting I've heard in a record of this genre I like what they're doing instrumentally much of the time the way that they're just experimenting with sound on some of these very fun and colorful tracks where the record really starts to lack for me is on the slower songs here and I definitely appreciate the variety the band is trying to bring with these tracks but on every slow burner here I just feel myself tuning out a little bit without the excitement of the more visceral songs I'm sort of forced to focus on the songwriting a little bit more like on songs such as holding out for you but on this track as well the playing is really loose and the way the instrumentation comes together the song just feels kind of unkempt and in kind of an unflattering way and I feel roughly the same about the song sitting up on our crane though I do like the kind of Spacey intergalactic aesthetic that this song and many other songs on here bring it's just that without a bold song to back that up the sonic theme of this album just wears thin a little bit even if the band does draw up some pretty inspiring instrumental moments on the album here like at the end of Medicine Hat which takes a while to get towards its finish in terms of energy but once it sits there the soaring guitar solos spattered with very glossy synthesizers it sounds like a comet flying through a starry night sky and the closing track on this record is actually pretty epic too personally I think this record is decent if you're a psyche pop diehard I think you should give it a listen and maybe there will be some longtime fans that are a little disappointed to hear the just the gruffer more distorted rock edge drift away from pond sound on this album but I think the fact that they've just embraced a more poppy sweeter more instantaneous sound and just some

Chan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new 6-9 mixtape day 69 this is the debut mixtape or project from New York rapper 6-9 or Takashi 6-9 or just simply Takashi he has been making an incredible amount of noise in the rap world over the past few years with a gauntlet of viral songs and singles and one look at this dude should give you a pretty clear idea as to how he's gotten so popular because in the SoundCloud seen in the SoundCloud world it seems like a lot of the artists on there are in a race to become the loudest wildest and and quite literally the most colorful rapper it's almost to the point when I look at some of these rappers and it just reminds me of the old days of new metal I especially get that vibe musically off sumit akashi's older singles like yo Kai and Zeta zero these tracks account for some of the most insane hip-hop to come out over the past few years but as Takashi has grown more popular over the past few years he's just become harder and harder to stomach for one a lot of his latest tracks just seemed like a really one-dimensional attempt at going commercial with more conventional production with more industry friendly features and his aggressive posturing seems more programmed than it does natural or exciting and then there's his unag Norah bolete - a 2015 charge of using a child into sexual performance which is deeply disturbing not just on its own but also in light of the cover of this tape referencing a kid's cartoon granted it is a kids cartoon that a lot of adults enjoy - but still also there are numerous lyrics on this project about essentially pressuring your sexual partner into having intercourse with like your friends or the rest of your crew which is exactly the kind of behavior that got 6:9 in hot water to begin with I get that he is paying or has paid his debt to society at this point but honestly it's it's all just really kind of difficult to come to terms with now am i surprised about this not entirely I mean 6:9 portrays himself to be an outlaw among laws also the repeated calls of scum on almost every track of this record which of course comes stands for society can't understand me which is kind of weird like it's you're not that difficult to understand you you're not you're not a Rubik's Cube even if you do share a similar color scheme I mean one of Takashi's earliest singles was the tracks come life I guess the point that I'm getting at is Takashi is exactly what he portrays himself to be he's not lying he's not joking he's not playing so I guess if you're gonna follow what he does and listen to his music go into this project understanding that and while I guess in one breath while that's something I appreciate about Takashi in another breath that doesn't necessarily mean I feel as music or anything especially with what feels to me to be a lack of layers or a lack of really anything substantive or interesting it's just kind of a lot of overly aggressive posturing for the sake of overly aggressive posturing the aesthetic of these tracks is similar to that of a lot of different soundcloud artists although not quite as cutting edge as some of the music he was releasing a few years ago and like I said earlier in the review I get the feeling that he's trying to do what he can to make his music more palatable for a more mainstream audience especially on tracks like Rondo featuring Tory Lanez or Kiki with a boogie with a hoodie and Fetty WAP on the hook as a rapper Takashi doesn't really bring too much to the table outside of a lot of yelling some of the tracks on here do get pretty murderous and dark though they also have this loud repetitive banging quality to them that kind of reminds me of like I don't know old-school crunk music but but with the scream vocals on top of it maybe even crunk core music of course with like a side of trap and hardcore maybe even some metal but truth be told Takashi's lyrics are pretty basic if not occasionally embarrassing he rehashes a lot of themes occasionally he rehashes flows I mean he even puts a song on here two times because he has another version of it with an offset feature there is a painfully bad closer on this thing with super messy mix like none of the instrumentation none of the sounds on this thing actually complement each other the swelling synth leads the rattling kind of cacophonous trap beat Takashi's constant yell rapping and this weird howling singing voice that just feels so out of place there are things about Takashi's music that are slightly compelling and definitely hit you hard and grab your attention especially if you're just listening to one or two tracks at a time but with one track after another on this thing it gets really tiring with the fact that Takashi really only has one Lane one sound one delivery it actually becomes pretty mind-numbing even though the runtime of this thing is really short just like 27 minutes the production on day 69 is really the project saving grace although for SoundCloud rap for overly aggressive hip-hop right now it's not that cutting-edge occasionally it goes super abrasive distorted or atmospheric on tracks like 93 the tape has a cool vibe but it's just way too OneNote to be entertaining as a whole nor do I think Takashi has the artistic ability to carry an entire project even if it's just for over 20 minutes yeah it's how he pits aggressive it's wild there's a lot of energy but it's not really anything I haven't heard done before very recently better by other rappers with catchy lyrics more versatility more charisma and more personality and a better ear for production to which occasionally does run kind of bland on this thing which is kind of saying a lot considering the production is really the best thing about this I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this tape transition have you given this tape of listen did you love it did you hate it what would you Reina

review of the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album gumboot soup this is the last of five albums that the Australian psych band promised us in 2017 releasing just before the year was over and all those records last year it was a pretty wild ride it went from microtonal tuning to some very snazzy elevator jazz to a record that fits into I don't know I could only call the genre post audiobook now the band is settling down at the final leg of this five album run with a record that isn't quite as strictly conceptual or as thematic as the four that preceded it gumboots oops 11 tracks truth be told they're pretty all over the place anyone who's been following the band's work up until this point are gonna catch at least a few moments of deja vu on this thing like the very serene and pretty vibraphone x' and jazzy percussion on the track last Oasis which sounds like it could have been a cut on Brunswick East except with slightly more lush instrumentation and more interesting lyrics and then there's greenhouse heat death which is eerily similar to a lot of the microtonal material off of flying banana with it's very jammy driving rock instrumentation topped with all these very twangy noodley guitar leads Muddy Waters wouldn't have sounded too awkward on that same record either and the very speedy and intense blend of punk rock garage rock and psychedelic rock on all is known that track would have actually been pretty tight on nonagon infinity especially with its multiple calls of it's kind of their thing on the album given how much material the giz has put out before 2017 and how much material he put out in 2017 you gotta expect the band is gonna tread at least a little bit of water here however the buffet style approach the band takes to the tracklist on this thing leads to some very refreshing and novel moments to the song beginner's luck is a very warm and welcoming piece of psychedelic pop vivid lyrics pronounced drum fills some very nice keyboards too that are kind of droney kind of blissful the track is just a touch of Beatles worship I would say but kind of has a quirk all its own then toward the end of the record we have the very serene but groovy sleeping in the instrumentation is incredibly mystical and intoxicating it makes my head Bob but also my eyes clothes I love the hushed intimate vocals on this thing and easily it's one of the stronger Tunes on the album - the great chain of being is probably the heaviest song King gizzard has ever recorded the band's real first major foray into pretty much stoner metal in sludge metal the song is heavy as hell the production is great and they enter this style with a fantastic amount of class and personality - and and dare I say that I think they've actually out written some of the bands that have been toiling with this style for years because King gizzards approach to melody is just a little bit more refreshing and the song superposition is a very odd track it features a kind of linear kraut rocky groove to it and the vocal harmonies on this thing have some processing on them that leave them feeling almost like cybernetic there are also some very regal woodwinds worked in the instrumental too that kind of gives the music this epic ascending quality as far as my ears can tell this record is not really all that conceptual or not as cohesive as a lot of the band's recent material especially the four other records they put out in 2017 sure while there's not a whole lot of consistency on this thing it's really only stylistic consistency I still think the band is pulled together a great crop of tracks the performances the production the writing are all there and outside of a few songs that came off to me as being a little mild or a little redundant like they could have just fit on previous records king gizzard is still delivering some of their most interesting material yet they still remain to be one of the best and most intriguing and most exciting bands in rock today and I am feeling a decent strong seven on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

portal album ion nuan profound lore records the fifth album from australian death metal wizards portal whose previous material has always kind of been a difficult digest for me in one breath I've always been kind of intrigued not only by the way the band dresses on stage when they perform but also by their completely unorthodox and sort of avant-garde approach to technical death metal the compositions they work into their tracks are absolutely dizzying and intense and typically add up into this incredibly noisy hellish uncompromising sound they're a metal band that really appreciates texture and Tambor as much as they do the melodies and chord progressions they weave into their tracks my issue though in the past has been they're decidedly murky production it's always made it hard to get a full picture of the band's music for me and has created a bit of a disconnect not only that but a lot of the technical flashes and details and intricacies of their music that are obviously there don't necessarily read all the time it's kind of like they're just throwing a lot of these amazing ideas just into the void but that completely changes it totally does a 180 on ion over here whose sound and performances are just as raw and as organic as any portal album thus far but the bass and drums and guitars are so much more pummeling and bright and vivid and the result of that is it just gives portals music so much more dynamics and punch of course the hectic performance is on this thing and the cultish aesthetic haven't really changed in this transition the band's music is really sounding more frightening and hideous and harrowing than ever and the band is using this wider frequency range on this album to just pile in more details layer on more dissonant horrifying guitars they also work in a lot of weird sound play too like the psychedelic and very surreal noises and sound effects especially on the song freaks where you do get some incredibly dissonant guitar overdubs or the song crone which features these very electric tingling swishes kind of washing in and out like waves underneath this rushing river of insane guitars it feels like I'm being whispered to in tongues by some kind of lightning demon while I'm being hypnotized by these incredibly just difficult to decipher tech death riffs the band also scratches new noise itches on these songs spores which is easily their most abrasive yet and they also bookend the album with these chilling Spacey dark ambient pieces that do a lot to I guess kind of send out and set the tone of the album which is incredibly dystopian and futurist and another insanely important thing about this record is just the flow of the entire album from track to track to track which is incredibly good just kind of keeps me on the edge of my seat for me flow in a death metal album is more important than it is in maybe any other genre because it's a niche genre it's a very loud abrasive sound the worst thing is when a death metal album gets stale or gets redundant which is why portal goes with the kind of half-hour standby that a lot of the old-school bands and the genre did and they don't really need to go longer because each one of these tracks is so dense it's so thick it's so detailed tracks can be listened to over and over and over and you just kind of gain new info and experiences from each track because it's it's just so mathematical and as naughty and as tangled each song on this thing is the more I listen to it the more each track kind of revealed its own individual flavor to me as well as quirks and characteristics like on the songs Adam in the second half the track features these gargantuan metallic bangs and clangs that are kind of in sync with the guitar riffs or the song s ion age which is one of the most densely packed songs on the entire record each chunk of like 30 seconds of guitar work on this thing is like so vastly different from the previous one different intensities different grooves and this track is is loaded with these really ghostly vocal performances to the vocal refrain on revolt of volts is probably the closest this thing comes to like delivering a hook revolt of all revolt oh now only that but the frantic guitar work on this thing toward the end is topped with these loud bright distorted searing chords that sound like I don't know a transformer having some kind of electric malfunction like there's like 10 million volts of electricity running through and it's about to explode for me the song husk is maybe the runt of the litter it's not quite as sonically adventurous or as densely packed as a lot of the other songs here but I do like the constant shifts in speed and tempo on this thing it does make it a unique moment on the album and an interesting listen to to a degree it's not a terrible track and one more time I want to specifically mention the outro on this album it does have a very dark very ambient tone to it there are kind of these ghostly disembodied like calling from beyond the grave human moan sort of calling out against like these very dark jeroni tones and what sounds like an old crackly record skipping and that's just one of the many moments on this thing that leave me feeling like I'm not just listening to an album I'm not just listening to a band I'm not just listening to a studio session I feel like this record really has a sense of place I feel like as I'm listening to some of these dizzying downward spirals of tech debt that I'm being dragged down into hell or something and I love that feel I love that vibe I love that darkness I love the band's aesthetic I just love how intense and surreal and detailed this album is incredibly impressed with it not just from the standpoint of a metal record but just on the whole of music I feel like this album just delivers and serves up so much because really the writing the production the performances the creativity the pushing of the envelope it's all there in spades really I can't complain about much of what this album has to offer I'm feeling a light too decent 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you

"},{"id":"AhVPv5q9Ik8","title":"Mount Eerie - Now Only ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"Hey everyone, Anthony Fantano here, 'The Internet's Busiest Music Nerd' and it's time for a review of the new Mount Eerie album, 'Now Only'. This is singer/songwriter Phil Elverum's latest musical transmission under the 'Mount Eerie' name, and Phil, if you're unfamiliar with him, in my opinion, is one of indie-folk's and low-fi music's most creative musicians, creative producers, not only when you take into account the fantastic albums he came out with under the 'Mount Eerie' name but also 'The Microphones', 'The Globe Part 2', 'Lost Wisdom', 'No Flashlight', 'It Was Hot, We Stayed in Water' and also last year's incredibly devastating 'A Crow Looked at Me', in my opinion, one of the best records of last year while also being one of the most emotionally traumatising as the album is a deep dive into the excruciating details of Phil's life around the time his wife passed away of cancer. Singing about her sickness, her passing, therapy, single fatherhood also wrestling with the feelings of grief, shock, denial, etc. This next album now only deals in a lot of the same themes, feelings, experiences, but is decidedly different stylistically the instrumentation on this album isn't quite as stark, isn't quite as low-key. The writing and structuring of these tracks is not quite as direct or pointed either, there are quite a few long and very winding songs on this record with some kind of meandering narratives, it's almost like Phil is writing a letter or a postcard just off of the top of his head to a loved one or, I guess, generally his audience. Of everything that's been happening to him, even down to the minor details since we last heard from him and honestly, it's all got a little bit, just a little bit of a Mark Kozelek, Sun Kil moon vibe to it. It's an interesting influence to hear pop up in Phil's music, as well as other records too, it seems like this long, rambly, uh, very off-the-cuff songwriting style that Mark has popularized this decade has been adopted by quite a few artists that I like. This album is 44 minutes features a handful of tracks that range from five to about 10 minutes. Some of the moments on this record are really emotionally compelling and heart-wrenching. Very straightforward in their storytelling like the track Tintin in Tibet which is a minor reference within the story itself contained in the song where Phil is essentially singing about being younger, having met his wife, living in a moment in their relationship where they were just deeply in love, finding out about one another and then juxtaposing that against moments in their relationship when she was sick and their time together was coming to a close. It's a really hard-hitting moment on the album, it's a strong sentiment to start the record off with and it's painfully clear that Phil is still kind of suffering through the agony of his feelings around this and understandably so. But it seems, at least to me, that when Phil switches over to tracks like 'Distortion' that are a little bit longer in their run-time and a little bit more rambly, a little bit more dishevelled he is no longer playing to his strengths as a songwriter or maybe this is just something that he needs to feel out a little bit more in order to make a more compelling track because while a lot of the same themes of emotional pain and loneliness and even a bit of a narrative moment where Phil is talking about being younger and having a pregnancy scare. Even though this is all very familiar given what he's been singing about lately, it's all kind of inconclusive and doesn't add up to too much. It's an OK listen at the end of the day but I feel roughly the same way about the 'Two Paintings by Nikolai Astrup', track the second longest song on the album later in the tracklist. I love and am enchanted by Phil's music a majority of the time, but do I find him to be so gripping a storyteller, to have so strong a delivery that he can just throw any minor detail out there and it just kind of keeps me on the edge of my seat in a song? Not necessarily, although I understand why at this point in his life he would kind of be obsessing over every minor detail as it does add to some incredibly cutting moments on this album especially on the closer where he is singing about his daughter wanting to hear Mommie's record, a record with her mother on it as she was a musician as well, a recording artist and this leads Phil to a point where they're listening to the album and he is sobbing in the middle of eating breakfast, something that personally I can't even begin to imagine dealing with. The title track on this record is one of the more succinct ones in the track listing it has a purposefully sweet and very melodic chorus that kind of talks about death and dying in a somewhat flippant manner about people getting cancer and dying getting hit by trucks and dying, but I feel like this is all a very admirable attempt by Phil to make a statement on just generally the callousness that a lot of people have toward death or just being so absorbed in their own issues that it's not really something they think about when other people may be going through it. As we see Phil filing through a hospital setting, as we see him filing through a setting where he's at a music festival and he has to play these, what he describes as 'death songs' for 'kids on drugs'. And then there is the maybe most haunting and morbid track on the entire record, 'Earth', which not only has a pretty interesting 'Wolves in the Throne Room' reference but is also a song where Phil is literally dealing with the transformation of his significant other from a living breathing human being to cremated ashes, remains. The instrumental on this track might not seem like much more than just some droney keys and guitars, occasionally a sort of wild, loud, distorted indie rock passage but it serves as a pretty great backdrop for his attempt to kind of process this, because it's really just kind of intense with how directly he stares into this abyss of death in his art, uh, especially as of late to the point where I find his music to be enjoyable and bold and brave and unique but also concerning too, which I guess that that's been my attitude since the last album as well, I mean I love Phil's music, I think he's a great artist but still I hope he's doing better, I hope he's healing, I hope he's okay. To me this album is a bunch of very good 'Crow' afterthoughts, sort of like an epilogue of sorts in a way. I liked it quite a bit, as a fan I like that he took some compositional risks on this record too, but it's maybe not an album I would recommend to a newcomer as it correlates directly with the last record which one probably should listen to first and isn't necessarily one of his most accessible. I'm feeling a decent 7 on this one transition, have you given this album a listen? Did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're the best, you're the best.

brand-new BTS album love yourself tear this is the latest full-length album from the k-pop phenom known as BTS the bulletproof Boy Scouts themselves it's their sixth full-length studio album with each new release growing their profile over here in the States and beyond one of their biggest releases so far being their EP mini-album that dropped at some point last year love yourself her which featured Smash Hits on is such as mic drop a track I liked quite a bit it's a pop rap banger of sorts as many BTS tracks are the thing is it's kind of hard to stylistically pigeonhole the group even though they are umbrella termed as k-pop because once you go into a BTS album you can expect not only to hear hip-hop elements and electronic music elements but pop of many different shades something that unquestionably makes the group stand out but simultaneously kills the consistency factor of their previous releases but love yourself is a little different in that it's kind of a conceptual release as was its predecessor love yourself her I wouldn't say this album is as much as sequel as it is a mirror image of sorts with love yourself her featuring much brighter and lovesick tunes whereas tear over here sees the group exploring more moody and heartbroken territory for like 11 tracks in 40 or so minutes and the record actually has a pretty decent start with the song singularity it's a super sensual introduction and sounds very much like a slow emotional 90s R&B throwback with super minimal percussion bass and piano very minimal however each of these bits of instrumentation make incredibly tasteful embellishments once you hit certain points in the song certain bits of the progression but doo-doo-doo-doo hmm the basin piano essentially just feel like they're caught in this incredibly graceful dance with the vocals which I might add are very well performed at this point I should point out that South Korea has a very long-standing tradition of making very sad and forlorn and dramatic and passionate soul and R&B music and even though BTS are categorized strictly as a k-pop group this song and a few others on this record as well feel like a very conscious nod to that tradition the song fake love the biggest hit on this album feels like an ultra poppy rap blend with a potently emotional edge the lyrics on this thing feel a lot like they're just kind of about being untrue about a relationship that you're in pretending to be happy even though you're sad in the relationship pretending to be strong even though you're hurt in the relationship I guess just falsifying your emotions in the relationship it's slightly obnoxious and kind of glitzy and feels a little bit like a bastardization of all the stylistic parties involved but the song is still delivered with a lot of heart and I can't deny how enjoyably slick the production on this thing is nor how meticulously the song has been assembled truth be told pop comes down to a lot of formulas and if that is in fact the case BTS has really kind of perfected what they're doing here the song the truth untold feels like another nod to the world of South Korean soul and R&B it's a very slow very Spacey powerful piano ballad and emotional showstopper where the vocals really steal the spotlight the lyrics on this thing are pretty much the groups of usual mix of Korean and English with a lot of references to I think wanting the other person or wanting the relationship with this person but not being able to give yourself to them or to the relationship I mean even though I'm hitting kind of a personal language barrier here with this track and others on this record as well the pianos and the vocals come together and just create a passion powerhouse that they give me all whipped up the following fourth track on here is a very tasteful piece of tropical jazz wrap with fun woodwinds and flavorful guitars really crisp drums very close claustrophobic sensual wrapping the group transitions really well into a soaring hook on this cut too which is an issue that I had previous with some of bts's work where continually the group would deliver these hyper aggressive verses whether it be kind of a pop or rap blend and then suddenly transition breakneck style into these soaring glamorous choruses that just kind of felt disconnected from the rest of the track stylistically but again this track over here by comparison feels so much more logical and consistent after this though I feel like is when the tracklist starts to fall apart a bit and kind of lose its own sense of identity and concept the track Paradise it's a decent pop song it's kind of bland but doesn't really feel all that strongly adhered to the mood that the record had been delivering so far the song love May's feels like a bit of a return to that and is infinitely a better song more fleshed out structure and stylistically it kind of feels like a throwback to a piece of American 2000s dance pop with bumping bass type percussion jangling rhythm guitars an orgasmic falsetto on the hook a lot of quality wrap flows and the lyrics on this track essentially being about the difficult decisions and directions that one might need to find themselves choosing when in the midst of of love or the love maze now if just to track ago the album was hitting a bit of turbulence I feel like after this is when things kind of take a bit of a nosedive the song magic shop is easily one of the worst on the entire record the song features these EDM style chords and beats rushing in underneath one of the most garish and grossly melodramatic hooks on the entire record magic the track airplane 2 is a sequel to a track that landed on the recent release from member Jay Hope on a solo effort and even though it's not one of the worst songs on here there's certainly some flavorful instrumentation on this thing overall it just sounds like the group trying to capitalize on the recent Latin pop trend in a somewhat awkward way the group continues their tropical instrumental streak on the next cut and Penman with a kooky banger be kind of a tedious redundant hook turn it up turn it up turn it up however I do love the groove and I kind of give the cut points for having a very unique subject matter as this song is pretty much a reference to the Japanese picture book an anime series of the same title essentially a show conceived by takashi honest about a superhero who doled out these japanese sweet breads whose conception was rooted in the starvation that a lot of japanese faced during the second world war the song so what is yet another low point on the album for it just kind of features a lot of very speedy foe macho rapping over a lot of EDM style beats which is not really something I'm interested in hearing whether it's an American group whether it's a foreign group it's it's really just not my style I just find it really um overblown so formulaic it's just a turn-off just kind of your typical mash of EDM and pop however love yourself tear does end pretty strong with the outro on this thing which is a kind of emo trap banger yes this thing has a hard crispy trap beat with strings on strings on strings and a series of fiery rap verses that simultaneously sound hard but also like each member of the group is on the verge of an emotional breakdown especially j-hope during his final verse of this thing who just sounds like a total mess and even reading into the translation I mean some of what he says is actually quite poetic so even though you could argue yeah sure you know love is a pretty cliched song topic subject matter at least it seems like BTS is giving it their all and approaching it overall even though this album wasn't a perfect record I still pretty much liked it it's the kind of futuristic but studied versatile but widely appealing pop music that I wish we were making over here right now in the mainstream instead we're suffering through phone nostalgia like Charlie puth Justin Timberlake's country phase and Taylor Swift trying to go dark and edgy why I love yourself tear does have its consistency issues its kpop it's about as commercial and it's premeditated as mainstream music gets so while it kind of sucks they didn't really stick to their intended concept I guess I'm not all that surprised because at the end of the day a group like this is most likely going to focus on just trying to have a little bit of something for everybody on a record as opposed to bogging it down in concept however I think this album BTS and their success are a big sign that Western artists need to start paying attention to a sign that South Korea is providing real competition in the music industry I mean I don't know what the future holds but for now BTS is delivering some incredibly slick music with tasteful instrumentation infectious hooks and passionate vocal performances to share a few of the instrumentals on this thing are kind of tacky and the group didn't really follow through that much with their concept but those aren't even issues that some of BTS is Western contemporaries try to avoid I guess the point that I'm making here is groups like BTS these k-pop groups are May pop music that's just as good as pop music over here if not better and hopefully going forward they continue to win over more listeners hone their craft and maybe make records like this a bit more consistently enjoyable I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it

mourn this is the latest album from singer/songwriter Corbin Smisek who broke back in 2014 under the name spooky black how anybody could have looked at this music video and not laughed I don't know this is a meme this is this is essentially a meme to me under the name spooky black Corbin had a few viral hits in the virtual realm he had an EP in album both of which in my opinion boiled down essentially to just really run-of-the-mill atmospheric moody alternative R&B and I wasn't really convinced or excited either when he started recording under the Corbin name and put out a pretty mediocre EP with the student ain't Bobby raps that that left a lot to be desired and his new album over here honestly I was just gonna write it off and go do something else but then I did anyway because there were tons of you guys just like hitting me up to listen to it and this is one of those instances where I'm happy that I have an audience of thousands of people harassing me to listen to certain things because to be real this this did impress me this is not the generic sad Reaver be R&B that passes as alternative in most circles today this is like also some painfully sad blue-eyed soul it's really synth-heavy it's really minimal it's very skeletal there's tons of production on this thing from DJ and Schlomo I think some of the instrumentals on this thing sound like they're inspired by the gothy er side of synth pop or darkwave I mean even the cover itself looks like you're you're gonna be in for some black metal and in the past few years Corbin's vocals sound like they have matured and have grown more agonized and despondent on this album it's like I'm listening to a cross-section of James Blake Sampha King cruel old old old twin shadow but then all of that is smothered in like this goth sized depression and what Corbin lacks and vocal ability on this record he makes up for in emotional delivery and painfully sad and lonely lyrics so lonely I would call the vibe of this album isolating and and the record definitely finds power in that feeling there are some moments where the songwriting is a little average and it's kind of like the structure of the track is meandering because it's almost like Corbin's singing is based mostly off of improv Zoar something like the song mourn or the song no title which kind of fizzles out at some point toward the finish even though the song delivers a very strong beginning and there are a few moments on this record where Corbin's vocals turned so sad they become borderline pathetic like on the song giving up where his singing sounds so emotionally desperate over a track that is essentially about what seems like facing facts and I assume a relationship of some kind saying that they have to give up or admit to the fact that they're lying but lying is all they have as if lying is the only thing that's kind of keeping this thing going and dealing with this is like making Corbin wriggle on the floor in a puddle of his own spit in tears with him just like screaming I'm good however when the drums really kind of kick in in the second half of the track and the song really starts to get propelled a bit that that is a point I do like on the record and there's a good handful of other tracks on this thing that really did stick with me to the song ice boy in my opinion is an incredible start to this thing the lyrics the vocals the icy synthesizers the percussion that features you know these very basic drum patterns these thudding kicks and popping snares the sound of this thing is like a perfect balance between you know a decent fidelity but it's also kind of raw it's also kind of lo-fi it sounds homespun there's a seething angst and just a huge palpable emotional tension that rides throughout this track and many others and while the instrumentation doesn't really grow that much more intense as the track plods along Corbin himself becomes this just fireball of uh just pent-up sad emotions as the track progresses the song revenge song is maybe my favorite in the batch here and features some very dark chilling and violent lyrics it out getting revenge on somebody who can guess from the the lyrics and the song raped his significant other the instrumental is very chilling the song is very cinematic listening to it's like I'm imagining sort of what's actually going on as he's singing these lyrics and kind of you know basically visualizing every piece of this storyline also I think the track features one of the better vocal melodies on the entire record - and the song all out while at first it may not sound like a lot as soon as the sort of big payoff and finish toward the end comes in I think the real appeal of the song shines through that beat drop although it's it's a relative beat drop this is still a very minimal stripped-back album I also love the lyric on here where you're singing about done being anywhere but this person's side and this is one of those albums that while the instrumentation may come off deceptively simple and there may be a lot of reverb in the mix it definitely does not take away from Corbin's personality does not take away from the distinct qualities of his vocals and it certainly does not take away from the emotional performances on these tracks - in fact I think it sort of adds to the the quality of loneliness on this album that it sounds like he's singing from the bottom of a well or something the songs something safe I also enjoyed quite a bit - it kind of seems like a depressing fusion of R&B and trip-hop with a pretty great rap verse from Antwan toward the finish of the track who I haven't heard from in a while and I think he adds so much to not just this song but the entire record the most major misstep in the track listing in my opinion has to be the song the fold-up which features these kind of bubbly almost peppy synthesizers that don't necessarily go with the overall vibe and aesthetic of the record not only that but over these synths Corbyn delivers these horrendous falsetto vocals that are so off and so out of place the song doesn't really become listenable until the second half the finishing song drag makes so much more sense as a song that comes through with a stronger vocal and some harder percussion mostly because the style of the synthesizers along with the sequence beats kind of does carry along with it that 80's goth and synth pop aesthetic with it overall I really like the vibe and aesthetic of this album quite a bit there are a lot of solids and tracks on here Corbin has a stronger sense of style here than he has on any project he's released so far and I think there's a good handful of songs on this thing - and I think Corbin is also on the verge of something actually refreshing with this alternative pop and R&B sound that being said this is not an incredibly consistent album though there are definitely some flubs or some underwhelming moments in the tracklisting but after hearing this I will certainly be looking forward to whatever Corbin does next that will not be even thinking about writing it off I'm feeling a light - decent seven on this thing transition

nerd and it's time for review of the new Sufjan Stevens record Carey and Lowell national treasure indie darling multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter and composer Sufjan Stevens whose discography has grown increasingly eccentric over the years you have his big break out albums loaded with contemporary folk music as well as chamber pop like Michigan and Illinois albums that were not only loaded with tracks that reference the history of these two wonderful states but there were also personal and painfully shy and sad songs on this record as well and that was contrasted by bits of very epic grand lush instrumentation there are also quite a bit of religious undertones that run through many a record from mr. Stevens he has numerous Christmas albums under his belt some of his records are hip-hop themed from the kind of tongue-in-cheek chopped and Scrooged to the sort of weird collaborative project Sisyphus that dropped last year that really went over better than it should have of course there is also the modern classical suite the BQE and instrumental tribute to new york's brooklyn-queens expressway and mr. Stevens is no stranger to electronic music either with records like enjoy your rabbit as well as the age of odds one of his bigger conceptual records with tons of sequence drums and synthesizers and and very textured glitchy electronics not really a high point for me in his discography though it seems to be for many however this new record Carrie and Lowell is taking a much more simple approach soufiane is really stripping layers away remodeling and kind of going back to very acoustic basics this is a very quiet intimate subtle and ballad driven album and incredibly personal to Stevens is really just singing about personal experiences on this album a bobble available and with his vocals as instrumentation he sort of takes a musical tone similar to that of like an Elliott Smith record and his Paul Simon fandom is a bit more readable with things being so simple and straightforward however even though Stevens isn't piling on the sounds and the instrumentation as he typically does this album doesn't feel like a regression or anything like that a lot of the tracks here are actually a testament to Stephens growth as a songwriter that he can come together with pieces of music that are so skeletal and still deliver a compelling song that also has a lot to do with the emotional quality of these tracks and the tales being told in the lyrics from what I can tell the entirety of this album is inspired by the recent passing of Stephens mother and not only does he reflect on her death but a lot of childhood memories as well in relation to her or just family the opening track on this record is gorgeous there's a folky little plucky melody that is very quiet very gentle in the lyrics Stephens is singing about his mother's ghost and forgiveness but reading into this track and others on this LP as well I kind of get the feeling that uh the relationship Stephens had with his mother wasn't the best if I'm hearing things correctly it sounds like Imus long should have known better that Stephens is kind of avoiding his mother in her time of extreme sickness maybe even when she's on her deathbed they're just not talking he's waiting for there to be some kind of cure or some kind of turnaround or something it just seems like he's distancing himself from the situation and he sings about being 3 years old and left at the video store but also acknowledging that the past is the past it seems like on a lot of this record Stevens is trying to come to terms with horrible things he might have done things that he has for a very long time not forgiving his mother for he simultaneously grieving and trying to come to terms with these events in the past that he might have been emotionally scarred by and he does this over fingerpick guitars and some really breezy beautiful background vocals the track drawn to blood seems like Stevens is I guess sort of dealing with the initial shock of some kind of maybe bloody and violent trauma and his approach to this track instrum is so simple the the rhythm of this song is essentially kept by these single electric piano notes and with the only thing which has some fantastic strings on it and the 4th of July we again are getting just very beautiful soft music set against some kind of morbid lyrics and very intense in the way that they approach personal tragedy lyrically Stevens really doesn't pull many punches when it comes to some of the refrains over these alluring folk Diddy's asking should I tear my heart out now or say we're all gonna die I guess my issue though with a lot of this LP is that Stevens vocals for the entire album aren't much louder than a whisper and I guess in theory I don't mind a subtler approach but I think this album specifically could have used a little bit more variety I think the record starts with some good intentions and some great songs too but uh things really I don't want to say fall apart but definitely wind down quality wise in the second half we are met with some songs that have some very abrupt endings the closing track on this album actually features what I would even call a non ending there's kind of these very ethereal tones just pop in out of nowhere and then just glide the track out the entire album out really suddenly Stevens is not really teasing all the potential out of these songs that he could he's really just developing them to the point where he gets some kind of personal emotional exorcism out of them and then just leaving them be which you know could be a good thing or a bad thing for fans I mean I'm sure there are people at this point we're very invested in what Stevens is trying to do with his art emotionally and to know that he is going through such an intense emotional grieving process through the music on this album will definitely attract some listeners and make this album feel special but just looking at this album from a vocal delivery standpoint from the standpoint of you know is is there a variety of approaches and different sounds on this record you know does each song kind of have its own strong personality this record definitely does leave something to be desired because for me as this album drew on there were moments that were really so faint they kind of fell into the background and I think there are some refrains and some lyrics here that the emotional impact of these tracks is sort of lessened by the fact that Stevens just feel so cold and lifeless a lot of the time with his vocals when the album started it certainly felt like maybe he was whispering because he was just on the brink of breaking down and crying but I just kind of feel like that that tension kind of drifted away as the record continued and this whisper-quiet vocal delivery just kind of became a thing just a sound and okay sound versus feeling overall not a bad record in the Sufjan Stevens discography I'm sure that fans are going to love it to death for me personally I thought there were some great tracks here it's definitely beautiful in moments it's certainly pleasant to listen to but I do think there are some lackluster tracks in the second half here and the selfie can be a little one-dimensional I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition what did you think about this album love it hate it why and what should Anthony review next but before he puts out a new video you can check out my channel where I play a lot of stringed instruments sometimes I play Kendrick Lamar songs on an eighth string guitar sometimes I play my own songs other times I or Slayer on banjo so it's a lot of fun and you should check it out and maybe subscribe yeah guitars strings forever "},{"id":"I8ZvRBl6zfA","title":"Dance Gavin Dance - Instant Gratification ALBUM REVIEW","y":1,"x":"hi everyone nothing happy at all kill me here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dance Gavin dance album instant gratification Sacramento rock band they've been at it for years and over the course of that time they have undergone numerous lineup changes but despite the revolving door of members the band has stuck pretty passionately to the post hardcore style bands that were essentially taking ideas and inspiration from the ferocity of hardcore punk music and fusing it with you know sort of current competing genres of music whether that be funk music dub music maybe some jazz alternative rock and some bands took things in a really emotional depressing direction setting the stage for emo like a rites of spring but a lot has happened to post hardcore music since the 80s and the 90s and the heydays of bands like Husker Du as well as shellac or maybe so Minutemen Fugazi and Drive Like Jehu and the genre continued to expand in the late 90s and the 2000s where we saw the game-changing refuse album the shape of punk to come yeah it it really was an album that featured very tight awesome grooves throw shredding screams incredibly heavy and visceral guitar riffs some groups took notice of this and push things into even more fast extreme complex territory of bands like blood brothers who were incredibly experimental for their time or even fall of Troy some bands went kind of progressive rock with the whole post hardcore thing like at the drive-in and and later the mars volta some bands started incorporating dance beats such as q and not you meanwhile emo is morphing into screamo with bands like NV and then other groups are kind of fusing hardcore punk or post hardcore with metal and you're getting metalcore like poison the well or from autumn to ashes meanwhile you have other bands that are taking this post hardcore sound and fusing it with some indie rock or pop rock or just pop punk or pop music in general some bands whose approach I enjoy going in this direction are like a brand new but other groups in my opinion maybe a little too sweet sugary the wimpy vocals and the pop melodies didn't really do too much for me bands such as Thursday or Circa Survive and dance Gavin dance is kind of one of those bands too there have always been other bands in similar veins that I just thought were more interesting so you know I just never really gravitated toward them and the reason I enjoy other groups in this same style of music continued to be shown on this new album from dance Gavin dance for one there are plenty of screamed vocals on this record which inherently is not a bad thing but I've always found dance Gavin dance --is approach to delivering scream vocals to just kind of sound more trendy than it is I don't know stand out or unique it just kind of sounds like this relic from the 2000s that um you know should have been given up by now and then there's the clean vocals that show up on this record because you know you're sort of getting these harsh vocals you're getting these harsh throat shredding screams and they're kind of matching these up with some cleaner melodic moments with cleanly sung vocals and these cleanly sung vocals are so nasal showy overacted and mixed in such a way that it's soaring over the music like a beautiful rainbow bird with a sparkle trail following its tail if I wanted your singing this over the top I listened to an Evanescence record these passages make 5 seconds of summer look like the next minor threat and now that we have these two moments in a dance Gavin dance song sort of established what happens is that they switch back and forth and back and forth and sometimes these two worlds kind of overlap a little like on the song something new where you're simultaneously getting these scream vocals some cleanly some vocals as well as some melodic guitars sort of thrown in together over the chaotic drumming and um yeah it's it's a pretty uh hmm and the lyrics on this up here not winning me over either and often the most readable lyrics on this album end up coming through during the cleanly some parts like on the song death of a strawberry hilarious title and in the midst of the song we're getting this being sugar daddy or on the opening track here let your hair down have one more round drink till you believe it sloppy kisses and dirty wishes baby this is living and the vocal melodies on this album that that are coming through all these clean vocals I can not stand them some of them like on the song the cuddler I can imagine kind of working well in a Katy Perry song and and and maybe they wouldn't sound too bad there but sort of contrasted with these really dated homely post-hardcore freak-outs there's absolutely nothing interesting about them you know the one thing I have to compliment this band on and compliment this record on is that it is impeccably tight and in a way the two things that they are constantly switching back and forth from standalone they sort of execute them well any single element of a dance Gavin dance song maybe aside from the lyrics if you pull it out it doesn't sound bad on its own but when it's all put together then how gaudy this music is becomes pretty clear in my opinion there's not a single redeeming factor in dance Gavin dance --is approach to songwriting there are redeeming factors in the clarity of the production on this album in the way that they perform this music again impeccably tight this album is just one diabetic Lee sweet melodic rock passage after another car crashed into these really obnoxious frenzied noisy rock freak outs in just a really obvious attempt at just clashing together these sweet spots with these aggressive spots in hope of coming together with some kind of artistic contrast of styles however dance Gavin dance has been doing this for so long at this point it's it's not anything that I think they're they're thinking that hard about it's just what they do except for the one part where we hear the song Eagle versus crows we're out of nowhere we get a Linkin Park quality rap verse I'll crush your mound up on your birthday cake with your whole family there watching at your aunt Viv's wake I liked the self-destructive girls where the fucks be all missing I find it interesting that they kind of characterize the women that they're into is self-destructive potentially the fans of this band because I find the listening experience of this record to be kind of masochistic I mean when I'm listening through this thing I really feel like I'm inflicting pain upon myself you know there are some albums there are some sounds there are some styles of music that when I listen to them I can kind of appreciate the artistry I appreciate the effort or the technical ability that goes into it but it's not really for me I think a lot of this sort of a very ultra clean very up perfectly produced prog metal out there is like that for me even dance Gavin dance over here hearing a song or two from you know a lot of their previous records over the years and you know I went into this LP just kind of curious just wanting to try it didn't have any big plans for a review or anything like that but I just kind of you know sat through it and sat through it and sat through it I continued listening even though I didn't really care for what I was hearing and the less that it clicked with me the more I realize that I don't even really think this is just a matter of me not liking the style of music that dance Gavin dance plays I think this album is in horribly bad taste the whole record functions on these incredibly uninteresting songs that feature these cliched crummy overuse contrasts between these harder more aggressive and softer and more melodic moments the vocals a lot of the time are desperate to be dramatic the lyrics when I'm reading into them are kind of cringe-worthy I feel like we're just packing a lot of filler in layers and musical complexities into a series of just would be pop emo songs that are just constantly interrupted by these heavy guitar riffs and throat shredding screams listening to this record I did not enjoy a single second of it nor do I see myself coming back to it for any reason other than to maybe have it giggle at that rap verse you know I'm feeling a strong one to alight to on this same transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it - jate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fanta no music forever "},{"id":"fW60RaP67qU","title":"Drake - If You're Reading This, It's Too Late ALBUM / MIXTAPE REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone to thinnies stacks tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new drake album slash mixtape if you're reading this it's too late Drake is a Toronto rapper singer whose career was put on the fast track in the late 2000s by little Wayne through a cosign getting signed to Young Money cash money records and he has dropped three successful albums since and has impacted the music industry more than any other rapper his age I think with loads of hot singles under his belt like zero to a hundred and best I ever had Marvin's Room headlines the motto hold on we're going home start from the bottom now ahead but despite Drake's incredible success and his influence on modern-day hip hop with his blends of pop rap and R&B he's continued to be a pretty polarizing figure for some he represents an ideological shift a generational shift in hip-hop music one that's less macho more in tune with its emotions which has been fuel for many an internet joke and personally I can't really say Drake has been a favorite of mine over the past five or so years either on every Drake LP there have been some singles that I've gravitated toward a little bit at least but would thank me later I was kind of turned off by all the sappy love songs on this record some of the lower moments on take care like Marvin's Room in my opinion were kind of immature and trashy even though that record in a sense is pretty interesting in that it is so kind of moody and ethereal for the genre and theoretically nothing was the same was a kind of interesting change of pace in that this help he was even more ethereal and even less single driven there are tracks on this record that managed to be big hits and very popular despite not being as a media in my opinion as previous singles like headlines but still nothing was the same did contain some of my least favorite Drake songs so far like wu-tang forever and worst behavior not only did this LP pop appeal but it also lacked real confidence which I think on a lot of the songs here Drake was overcompensating for again do you bring it back to worst behavior which features a vocal inflection that's just ridiculous kind of like Drake is trying to make up a big boy voice but now we have this suddenly dropped new mixtape slash album which comes in the midst of drama heavy drama involving Young Money cash money billionaires labelmate little Wayne from what the music media has reported thus far little Wayne has not been able to release his new full-length project is commercial project the Carter five and live and learn little Wayne of course is pissed is trying to leave the label is trying to sue the label and some music websites have been reporting that this new project here fulfills a four album record contract that Drake has with Young Money cash money however some journalists have responded by saying well actually we're not really totally sure whether or not that's true where is this information coming from what's the source on this information so I'm not I'm not really sure I mean this album here could either be an appetizer for the LP that Drake is scheduled to release later this year or maybe it's Drake showing solidarity with Wayne and trying to break away from the label if in fact he has finished his record contract out with this project we'll we'll sort of see whether or not that obligation has been filled when Drake goes to release his new album later this year so in a way this new project over here is kind of like a placeholder and some people have kind of theorized that this may in fact be a bunch of b-sides or just unused recordings and even if that is the case I don't think there is a lack of effort reflected in that and actually I mean a lot of what's here seems pretty new like Drake is reacting to some pretty current events on a few of these tracks and sonically aesthetically all the songs here are pretty cohesive almost as if they were recorded and conceived within a very recent time period if this were a bunch of b-sides we would be getting tracks that sound like thank me later Drake we'd be getting tracks that sound like take care Drake we'd be getting tracks that sound like nothing was same drake and maybe even mixtape drake from 2009 but really i just don't think that's the case especially considering just how well a lot of these songs flow together as far as the material that's presented here we're essentially getting 17 tracks lyrically drake isn't really approaching any topics here he hasn't before he's famous he's a rapper successful he's rich sometimes he's in love sometimes he's reflecting back upon his family in his youth and there are some memorable lines on these tracks to drake drops some gems there's one line where he's rapping about throwing rappers heads up on his mantle as if he's a hunter there's another line here that i liked were you saying that he has to act like he likes some of these rappers but his acting days are over so screw that and Drake's acting days are usually something that has haunted him and has been kind of used against him in a negative way and I think this was an interesting bar to kind of flip that around fire back and reverse that weapon on his critics there's one line where he's talking about all these things that he's buying and buying and buying and then he ends the series of material things off with and you better keep track of it everything I'm buying the new shits on steroids it'll never pass a physical really a drug test but physical okay the other line about someone picking their casket and he'll put a nail through it there are a lot of lines here I'm like okay Drake sounded aggressive he's sounding charismatic he's sounding like you know he's really going forties hungary's intense and there are a lot of tracks here where Drake sort of seems to to center on a certain idea like on energy with haters and people sort of bugging him draining him of his energy and he's not gonna he's not gonna let that happen I would actually say it's a pretty awesome anti hater anthem the opening track year legend the idea behind is pretty simple if Drake were to die now he would become legend maybe you and the six Drake is getting kind of nostalgic and he's kind of rapping directly to his mom on this track and it's a pretty heartfelt on the song Madonna I think he's a I don't know seeing potential in this girl telling her to get in his car kind of hitting on her but in a way I'm not really sure if that potential is really there he's just kind of feel your head with nonsense to I don't know get her pants not sure there's the song company where Drake is rapping about how he is a dog and kind of unworthy of a real loving relationship and the song used to as well which you might kind of be familiar with if you heard the mixtape little Wayne dropped earlier this year Drake is essentially talking about getting used to the fame on this track how long has he been famous at this point he's still getting used to it but that's kind of been a consistent thing for Drake even at his highest points in music there's always just like a little bit of awkwardness that you could read into on some of the deeper cuts of his albums just kind of the sense that he's not where he belongs or he's just not comfortable in his own skin and that's been kind of a turn-off for me on past projects like if you're going to be that insecure I mean just be open about it and just own it and just make music about it rather than swinging back and forth violently between just TMI exposing a little bit too much and then sort of overcompensating for it I think on if you're reading this Drake finally finds that happy medium that he used to kind of be at in his older mixtape days to finish off the record topically the song star 67 has some pretty smart phone metaphors and the last track here which the internet has been in an uproar over Drake froze an incredible amount of shade at Tyga really clever line about him not acting his age but his girl's age rappers just really want to marry into that Kardashian royalty don't they but what's most important on this LP is now what Drake did or what Drake said but really what he didn't do what he didn't say he didn't make me cringe anywhere on this entire record there is nowhere on this album where he is desperately drunk-dialing some wannabe like I was with you first there aren't any moments where he's too afraid to get out of the car to pump gas instead Drake loses with actual confidence which on this LP i think is pretty contagious in the same way that it would be on a 2000s era jay-z record but also Drake is a little more self-aware in that he'll kind of check himself and maybe say something poignant every once in a while about himself his position rap music as an industry or other rappers and I get that some people aren't really going to be interested in that topic bake bake bake Drake is not going back Packer political or super deep or anything like that but his very high profile position in the music industry makes his autobiographical rhymes worth delivering so Drake's confidence is convincing on this project but he brings some good hooks and melodies as well like on the song energy or know yourself running through the six with my wool or even preach with partynextdoor or use to which has a quick little funny cool catchy repetitive hook or the song six man and most of these songs have some pretty aggressive flows to maybe just aggressive by Drake's standards but aggressive all the same Drake has a certain approach to aggression he's not super angry super mad or anything like that I would say his aggression is more fact-based let's talk numbers who's bigger who's better who's got more of everything if you want to view the world that way that's okay I guess what makes it charismatic to me on this record is that Drake's consistent confidence has him filling out these big-boy braggadocious shoes now sonically this record actually reminds me quite a bit of nothing was the same but with some actual aggression and bite and I would actually say this project has more guts to it even if it doesn't see as much success as nothing was the same formulaic ly most of the tracks on this project actually reminds me of a zero to 100 atmospheric skeletal instrumental confident delivery and beat change up toward the end of the track where Drake might be doing a little bit of singing or maybe some more melody is introduced in the instrumental and maybe kind of dark and nocturnal - like I said most of the songs here run with that formula and even tracks with more bustling aggressive beats and flows like six God for example even this track with its very simple kind of plain actually fit into the minimal aesthetic of the album overall and I think these songs actually see a lot of success and quality because of this 0 to 100 formula especially the songs that have the most epic and huge emotional change ups toward the end like the song company with Travis Scott and even the two partynextdoor tracks on here kind of feel like one long cohesive song the songs are turned off by the most are the ones that follow this formula to the point where they don't actually do a change of toward the end and instead kind of stagnate and sound a little repetitive by the time they finish songs like legend which I wish varied up a little bit more maybe was just kind of shortened or Madonna or jungle or now and forever but even though these songs are low points to me I wouldn't say they're necessarily horrible they're not songs I'm scrambling to skip once they come on actually like a bulk of this album even if this record doesn't go down as one of Drake's biggest projects historically I think it is my favorite commercial project that he's dropped so far if you're looking for some simple straightforward low-key but very catchy pop rap with a lot of confidence and a lot of brags then I would check this record out there are also some creative references to some pretty important influences to Drake on this LP like genuine as well as the roots and Erykah Badu on one particular track here and I really think on this project Drake has his usual emotional baggage kind of in order to the point where he isn't losing control over it it's not impeding upon the enjoyment of the album and hopefully he continues to keep it this well organized as we continue on to his next full-length album later this year I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this no way yeah I know ashin if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantan Oh Drake if you're reading this is too late forever "},{"id":"jGfK-R4rKxY","title":"Injury Reserve - Floss ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"yeah hi everyone good here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new injury reserve project floss injury reserve is a rap trio hailing from the unlikely location of Arizona this is their second full-length project following up 2015's live at the dentist office which was actually recorded near a dentist's office not sure if this project was recorded while flossing I was pretty psyched listen to this thing because injury reserves big breakout tape last year showed them to be one of hip-hop's most exciting rising up-and-coming acts taking the flows and charisma and lyrical chemistry of jazz rap and updating it for 2015-2016 with progressive production and banger beats and they're not beyond dropping some introspective dreary tracks either if injury reserve is anything it's versatile Richie with a tea and grogs together bring a set of bars that are clever insightful funny and occasionally personal all of which are laced with a myriad of quirky pop-culture references and with this new project over here they seem to be just pulling out all of the stops coming through with their most aggressive set of tracks yet off the wall bangers with a dump truck of personality and wit the kind of shit that's insanely catchy will most likely go over well with most modern hip-hop fans but could also you know open up a mosh pit - that is pretty much how injury Reserve sets the tone of the record with the opener oh shit not just because of how the shouted grimy chorus pairs up with the dreary chopped up piano samples it's not just the trunk knocking bass and a hook so strong you could catch a great white shark with it and it's not just the lonely auto-tuned singing at the very finish of the track which is surprisingly good or bars like remember when I had a composition in the backpack like a notebook now we killing with all the composition like the Rat Pack which links back into the very funny refrain this ain't jazz rap this that this that spaz rap uh it's not it's not just those things it's also that the the song the song is good the trio keeps up the momentum on this project with the song bad boys obviously a reference to the movie franchise starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence I love the gospel spiritual vocal samples laced throughout the instrumental sort of reminds me of college dropout Eric Kanye the track is basically this sort of jazzy awesome instrumental and two solid verses with memorable bars about dropping a tape that was classic but motherfuckers couldn't find it sort of talking about how great but also how obscure the trio's last project was then rich he goes on to say something about them being like the rap game Weezer and how he's dressed like Carlton he's the black ben Carson and the trio brings yet another barn burner with the song all this money another one of the year's best rap singles and Richie with his monstrous growl on this hook and just the instrumental these guys are unsigned what they're making most mainstream rappers sound like lit lit a cute fluffy kitties hey baby that's this track obviously a little funny a little tongue-in-cheek sort of about recklessly spending your money you could go on a spending spree to this track whether you have $2,000 in your pocket or two dollars in your pocket and from here the trio effectively sways between these powerful bangers and more nuanced cuts the song s on your chest is buttery smooth jazz wrap with some amazing fluttering horn samples complete with some pretty prominent little brother references right in the first verse very sweet very tasteful definitely a highlight and then all of a sudden they bust out with the song what's goodie which features this loud bang or off-kilter instrumental but most importantly one of the best features of the year from none other than cakes the Killa who brings all these braggadocious bars about sort of being a trendy socialite getting drink tickets in his Mishka hoodie I love his closing line saying that if you kiss the Don don't leave a hickey his voice gets pretty animalistic right there it's definitely one of the best performances on the mic I've heard this you so fast so intense so precise so energetic and then with the track girl with the gold wrist we have this sort of funky desert vibe going on this groove going on with the track that has these really prominent acoustic and electric guitar licks dudu boom one of the most unique rap beats I've heard this year the topic of the song being about this jaw-dropping woman at the club as grogs and Richie detail all these inner feelings of lust and desire infatuation and a bad decision making the 2016 interlude I like as well I typically roll my eyes when people sort of use the current year argument when they're sort of debating politics although I find this song to be sort of funny a little tongue in cheek as Richie sort of flatly says hey you know the you know you're not talking about where your family got their wealth you're not admitting that you're wealthy you know what that flag on your belt buckle means why are you pretending global warming isn't a thing I mean again as silly as I think the this go to argument is there are some things that just really it's sort of hard to believe that we're still doing this shit in 2016 now I will admit this is where the album wanes a little bit for me we have all Quiet on the west side which has a solid verse to kick things off I love the pitched sort of very deep chorus vocals on the track too reminds me of like an interesting ASAP mob or something but after this verse the song just turns into this like extended instrumental outro and I feel like there just could have been more and I have to give it to eenie meenie miney moe as my least favorite cut on the project although it's not like terrible and I think I've sort of grown to tolerate it a little bit I do like the lyrics I do like the verses quite a bit especially when Garage is rapping about what it takes to make it in the rap game but the tracks full-on blown out distorted in-your-face almost industrial flavored instrumental paired with the sort of incessant redundant Nursery Rhyme hook it's just not like the best pairing it get kind of old yeah yeah yo a little fast and this sort of industrially tinged sound is something that I feel like they return to on the song back then another banger sounds huge has this gigantic auto-tune chorus and thematically the song is not too much unlike that of a track by the same title once performed by one of the Great's Mike Jones sort of comparing the fact that people are obsessed with you want to mess with you want to have something to do with you now because you're successful versus back in the day when people were in that's not so much interested and I'm not so much sure I'm all that crazy about the weird auto-tune solo and sporadic drum solo an outro of the track still though love the song keep on slip in a very dark moment on the record with a fantastic feature from vic mensa whose verse is really an emotional roller coaster especially the point at the very end of his verse when he raps about trying to get his shit together working to make everything go right but as he tries everything just goes wrong everything gets worse and it's at this point on the album that I kind of wish that injury reserved maybe went down this road on one other track on here especially since some of the dreary er moodier cuts off of live at the dentist's office are some of my favorite songs of theirs period and I think that they pull this mood they pull this vibe off better than a lot of rappers today do they can go personal they can go heartfelt and it's actually you know legitimately compelling but I could sort of understand that they wanted to reach a new audience with this project that they wanted to hit people over the head with this project they wanted to deliver a a high octane experience with this project still the closure does satisfy as another personal moment on the project it's really triumphant moment it is in a way a feel-good moment but very sentimental to as the trio looks back on the long road that took them to where they are today there's some gospel vocal samples sort of fading in and out of the beat sporadically I like their inclusion although I'm not really all that happy about how they were treated I wish they were a little more prominent in the mix and it just got really I don't know moving as grogs and Ritchie started rapping about just their efforts and their family and their loved ones as Ritchie was referencing sort of you know writing a card his mother with rap lyrics on it to tribute her dancing in the kitchen dancing in the street as a young boy this one moment where he says it just sucks when I'm at your funeral and no one knew I existed the referencing his father's funeral but I ain't really tripping man that's family business had the same outfit on I graduated in because I heard you were fighting the doctors and they still made you miss it which at the time when I had first heard that lyric and really listened to it it really fucked me up and I love Gragas closing line on this track when he says you know we took you to the dentist's office and now we took you to church on this new record over here I love this project I mean it's not a perfect record in my opinion I've been seeing a lot of people hype this album up and saying hey it's album of the year and honestly I'm really happy that some people feel that way because I think this is great and I think in a lot of ways this is a step up for injury reserve and regardless of how much I like this record or how much I don't like this record in comparison with live at the dentist's office I would love to see them do well because I do think they are an interesting creative force in the underground that I see no reason why your average rap fan wouldn't love a song like oh shit wouldn't love a song like all this money wouldn't love half of the fucking songs on this project so hopefully this album spreads a little virally for them at the end of this year start of next year I like to sell them a lot some of their best material so far lands on this thing a few shaky tracks in the last third but nothing that really bucked me off of the album nothing that really had me disappointed with the project in general I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing try transition have you get in this injury reserve project a listen God I hope you have because it's the last best project of 2016 is the last great project of 2016 all sorts of links next to my head other videos you check out subscribe to the

"},{"id":"Rhxuyujfep8","title":"RiFF RAFF - NEON iCON ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and neon icon is the latest full-length LP from Houston rapper riff raff man who is a Gucci mystery wrapped up in a Versace enigma and locked away into a Louima his recent rise in popularity has been pretty unlikely considering that he was an MTV reality show vet who's 15 minutes of fame were up but miraculously through a series of mixtapes singles features and collaborations and James Franco essentially playing him in that recent Spring Breakers movie riff-raff has a ride to his rightful place as a musical and titania on Diplo's Mad Decent label and through that label he is dropping his largest commercial release yet neon icon now riff raff is not your average rapper he's a goofy mother yes but it's a little more ambiguous than that you can just take riff raff as being silly but he has some undeniably catchy and absurdly clever lyrics or you can take him seriously but he very clearly doesn't even take himself that seriously and a lot of his lyrics clearly do have a humorous intent to them riff raff mostly relies on a kind of comedic shtick that admittedly does get old after a while and even riff raff himself knows that which is why he tries to break things up a little bit on his other projects and this album with slower tracks and ballads and sketches and radio-friendly pop rap jams avenues where riff raff silly inflection and lyrics don't have quite as much comedic impact kind of like the song time a track where I don't even think the song is supposed to be funny I think it's actually supposed to be meaningful the song that's a bit of a personal look back at riff Raff's past musing on the social construct of time talking about how it passes by a dime-a-dozen observation that even coucher chesta could point out to me time moves the day like way it sure does friend admittedly I'm not really impressed with how philosophically gallo this track is and how weak of an attempt this song is to stir up an emotional moment and his singing on this song is straight garbage yeah it's it's moments like the closing track on here VIP pass to my heart where I hope that what riffraff is doing his image his songs everything is really a stick a big fat stick because the idea of someone making this song seriously frightens me but part of riff Raff's persona is that the things he says in the way he looks and the songs that he sings are all worth kind of gawking at the gawk is an essential part of the riff raff formula and now that he has a pretty significant amount of fans who enjoy his trap flavored songs that have all these ridiculous sort of tongue-in-cheek absurd lyrics you've got to bring these people in and also give them something to gawk at because if you're not then they're just simply enjoying your music and even though this is the worst song on the album by far and I'm very happy that it's at the end of the LP as opposed to in the middle of it there are other terrible tracks on this LP - like the song cool it down with Amber Kaufman singing on the hook a song that with its light rat be in its acoustic guitar sample on the song it feels like I'm listening to a whitey Ford sings the blues' song to go back to the song time I feel sort of the same there as well except there's a banjo in the background of all things it's actually maybe a little bit more like that terrible collaborative track that Nelly came out with years ago with Tim McGraw oh it's not musically identical but it is similarly corny and really horrific blend of genres and then their songs on here where whether they're jokes serious I can't quite figure it out I'm just shaking my head at them like maybe you love me a song that just doesn't have that riff-raff flavor to it it's a generic radio pop hit with a chorus that has very little bearings on on anything that riffraff is saying in the verses to the track you could plug any rapper to this song and it would work just as well which is why it's so disappointing to hear it on a riff raff album because he's nothing if not weirdly unique and songs like this just failed to live up to that reputation there are a handful of songs on this thing that I think are great like the intro to this LP which is absolutely perfect except for what sounds like some surfer dudes riff Raff's versus his bars are insanely hilarious and the beat on this track sounds like something out of nwaz Straight Outta Compton then after this you get the crux of this album those trap bangers with those riff raff isms in the lyrics wetter than tsunami how to be the man aqua very dolphin tiptoeing in my Jones amazing tracks off of this LP some of riff Raff's best material yet in this style really what riffraff does best period what we know him for and yet he does it so seldomly on this LP it's just disappointing that there are more tracks like this in the track listing but if there's anything I can rely on riff raff for into the future I'm sure that he will keep me gawking and he will keep me guessing I'm feeling a strong 5 on this LP transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next riff raff neon icon forever "},{"id":"4ZZREmYnygU","title":"Parquet Courts - Wide Awake! ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"hi everyone yes that a yes Tanna here the Internet's most chicken the microphone is honored and it's time for a review of the new parquet courts album wide awake this is the latest full-length album from Brooklyn rock band parquet courts who have been steadily dropping album after album EP after EP since 2011 sliding back and forth and every one of their tracklist effortlessly from indie rock to art Punk to post-punk and garage rock and experimental rock and despite a pretty strong devotion to a handful of rock subgenres I've had varying and strong reactions to pretty much every record parky quartz has put out so far of course though I am on the edge of my seat looking forward to their latest over here especially since their last album human performance I think is easily one of their best the closest the band has come thus far I think to releasing a truly fantastic record I also loved the incredibly smart and groovy teasers to this new album over here like wide awake and had to start a fight the band somehow even won over Ellen doing a performance of the song wide awake on her daytime television show which I guess is kind of crazy and it's just great to see that parquet courts peak of relevancy is coinciding with what I think is their best album and for a myriad of reasons the performances on this thing are exciting tight intense and lively the production is really organic and vibrant the record comes off sounding like an in-the-moment studio session but has enough bells and whistles and interesting touches of effects and overdubs to keep the sound interesting and deep thirdly I think it can be argued that this is parquet courts best crop of songs yet versus our great choruses pop and across the length of the entire album there is an extreme lyrical focus on socio-political issues which I mean it's 2018 who isn't getting political in the age of Trump but there's actually a lot of smart commentary on this album about wealth disparity and violence the normalization of our increasingly toxic political climate and some of the lyrics here go beyond the slogan ear and you typically get out of pop songs that try to go political and actually delve into political philosophy like on the opening track total football where you will hear the band shouting that collectivism and autonomy are not mutually exclusive which I mean because it's not you can bargain for your own rights as a collective while maintaining your personal freedom the follow up line to that is incredibly sharp and also the the Tom Brady at the end is a very nice touch you know because of the whole Total Football theme Illustrated earlier in the track it's a very interesting intro these are not points of view that are typically addressed in punk songs even in bands where some of the members have bachelor's degrees and the fourth thing I'll say about this record is that across the tracklist it has an incredible flow it's pretty much one well worded art punk rager after another with seamless transitions and tastefully executed cool down moments and I mean it's just highlight after highlight after highlight the song violence features markedly improved drumming and bass right from the get-go which if there's one huge improvement on this record from any parquet courts album previous it's that man like the percussion the grooves those bass lines they're spectacular the instrumental on this cut sounds like a really solid piece of 70s instrumental rock with a strong funk influence and some very serious and bright organs popping in which pull off a kind of psychedelic solo in the last leg of the song and even though there is that big funk rock influence on this track there are some very jagged noisy abrasive guitars and shouty lead vocals which lead that sound lead that style into a very Punk conclusion I love the lyrics on this track just kind of going in depth about the societal numbness that we feel toward the violence the increasing violence that we're kind of finding ourselves in the midst of I mean I feel like this song is incredibly apt in the wake of what just happened in Santa Fe or whatever happened at the latest school shooting at the time of you watching this video because let's face it our politicians are literally doing nothing about this problem the song before the water gets too high is a great transition out of this track much more dejected nowhere near as intense it really contrasts the previous song by feeling so futile and defeated I love the nimble bassline the relaxed but very crisp drums the cheap Casio chords and the chilling lyrics are all about things getting so bad that it may get to a point where it affects the rich does it need to get to that point almost had to start a fight is an incredible two parter with super-tight syncopated guitars drums and vocals and these opening words kind of being stuttered or repeated at the start of each line really kind of adding to the the tension of the track I mean the song is literally about what it's kind of titled after and the there's a sense of real panic in the song as a result of that it feels like being forced in the midst of a fight-or-flight decision the song transitions out of these intense and syncopated guitar passages into something a little bit more laid-back but then you're catching lyrics about being in a brutal invention or a chaos dimension I also love the transition into the second leg of the track in and out of patience which is an intense driving rock tune with very fun very catchy guitar leads and ascending vocals it really kind of calls back to bands like the modern lovers we get another great transition into the song free bird too which is another more introspective moment in the midst of all of this political unrest on the album with I believe Andrew savage singing over some kind of quirky and a little tongue-in-cheek classic rock ish organ chords about growing older and kind of waxing poetic about his past and slowly kind of growing into his own point of view identity the song normalization is as aggressive as it is chilling I think it's in a similar conceptual vein to the song violence earlier in the tracklist but much more bombastic and in-your-face there's a weird psychedelic funk breakdown in the midst of the song - the song feels a bit more abstract and big picture from a lyrical standpoint as well then we have the title track which is supremely funky in a way reminds me of what I loved so much about LCD soundsystem in the mid-2000s it's just really eccentric thoughtful punky dance music whose lyrics kind of state the album's mo of I guess being wide awake being aware kind of keeping up this pace of awareness it's kind of like the post-punk equivalent of being woke the song death will bring change helps bring the album closer to its finish and is an incredibly haunting moment on the album kind of takes a bit of an old-school psyche Rock tone it's it's a little doors ish features some very dramatic dreary guitar chord strummed in a in a very loose way enhanced by these eerie children choruses singing death will bring essentially predicting things will alter as this new generation comes into adulthood and replaces the old guard the band ends things on a somewhat lighter note on the track tenderness with these carefree rhythm guitars a kind of jaunty saloon piano the lyrics again kind of pushing toward these themes for change in the future which I mean if you read into the first verse of this track it's it's actually really poetic beautifully so and I think it's a moment on the album where the band and and even me myself for a long time now have kind of come to terms with the fact that unfortunately political change and societal change rarely comes as a result of just kind of flipping people's minds and ideas right then and there usually it comes with generations of people over time kind of learning from their mistakes and kind of replacing the older people and then enacting the societal norms and standards they now want to enact as according to how they perceive the world so that is certainly part of it but again the song is also making a deep reference to tenderness which it is titled after with the band kind of crossing their fingers artistically for maybe more tenderness around the corner in the world's future with the songs closing lines referring to tenderness itself almost as a drug something that the band's lead singer needs a fix of there were a few spots on the record that lulled for me just a little bit I thought the vocal performance on the track back to earth was a little too awkward I loved the chord progression I loved the slow pacing I loved how dramatic and melodic the track was I don't know if it was a vocal range thing or a tempo thing but just the singing on it just felt a little fumbling and Mardi Gras beads even though I do like the tune of that track quite a bit the reverb on there really washes it out just a bit too much which is one of the things that I like generally about the other songs on here that they're so dry that they're so tangible that you really feel a lot of the instrumentation but outside of that I mean this record is so great and on point the songs the recording the performances the playing is noticeably better than that of any Park a course record so far this record is certainly more lyrically intriguing than a lot of the Bands previous records as well and I feel like they did a great job of making some interesting artistic statements on some very very very difficult topics I'm feeling a light to decent 9:00 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a

REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone grimes inning time tan oh here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new wiley album godfather this is the latest album from UK grime legend wiley one of the genres longest-running acts in the UK hard-working prolific and a major player in the grime scene so far this decade has been an interesting one for Wiley he kicked it off with his 2011 album 100% publishing where he not only wrote the entire album produced it and mastered it as well and then he spent his next few records trying to infuse like some pop appeal in his music to I guess kind of create some commercial crossover success I think he came the closest to sort of balancing that hard grind sound with a bit more of a commercial appeal on his snakes and ladders album but for me Godfather is the most exciting thing he's done in this decade so far because this is just so pure unadulterated fucking grime it's just banger after banger after banger with little to no compromises and not to say that this album is going to be exciting to everyone grime is a very particular genre of music it's instrumental style is greatly influenced by genres of electronic music that are huge in the UK as well as dance hall to the BPMS are a little faster than I think most Americans are used to the groove patterns are much different than a lot of music Americans are used to especially when it comes to styles of music where you have artists rapping over these instrumentals the lyrics on these grime albums are loaded with slang that you're either going to have to look up or read into or just try to guess the meaning of because you're probably not from where Wiley is from and the rap flows especially in the case of why we are super nutty just punctuated heavily with hard consonants and vowels and the flow style which is relentless a lot of the time when it comes to a wily track come off almost robotic in comparison would be smoother or more laid-back or maybe even animalistic rap styles that you might catch in America and Wiley is not some genius storyteller or anything like that he's not I spin in narrative yarns over here on these tracks he's not this conscious rap prophet either a lot of his lyrics typically give off this very bratty self-promotional aggressive tone so you know don't go into this album unless you're ready to hear some serious British attitude now once you've got a grip of exactly what grime is and what Wiley typically does on a Wiley album it's pretty easy to see just how hard knows how pureblood of a record this is just how consistent and hard-hitting it is nearly every track and the track listing here come through with banging bass energizing grooves the song Holi grime comes through with these heavy buzzing bass notes epic choral vocals and like some chimes - the song speaker box is not nearly as straightforward but just as visceral with its stuttering high hats and sort of off-kilter grooves song back with a banger has a bit of a two-step vibe to the beat some very tight since sequences that are almost dizzying and the beef for the song Joe Bloggs almost has like a bit of a trap thing going on it's sort of cool to kind of see that cyclical influence going on here with the minor chord progression and the heavy kick drums and the rattling high hats of course they're only a couple tracks from the track listing that I would say go kind of easy on the listener for one the song laptop which swaps out some of its heavy bass for some weird bleeps and bloops and it's actually kind of fitting because lyrically the song is a bit of a tribute to the laptop that why we use is to create his music he raps about this thing as if it is a tool that he uses for his craft which it is but it's kind of funny just how promotional and tone the song almost gets at some points we're just like MacBook Pro forever I got a MacBook Pro for a while I've been a MacBook Pro and the song you were always part to which is a bit of a cliched on the on the rocks love song which God shows some of the lyrics from this from the song it is so cringy the lyrics on this track are so awful in that they are incredibly plain you know there's a point at the beginning of the track where Wiley is like oh it's so easy to rap about this because it's true but the thing is like despite the fact that it might be a true situation you bring out absolutely no specific details about any of it to the point where it just really could have been anybody's experience and it's kind of hard for the listener the reader whoever to kind of appreciate what's going on or see any I don't know anything to really relate in it because it's just such a run-of-the-mill story the one specific in this story that stuck out to him was the moment when while he talks about having a fight with his girl and mandos which had me have horriffic flashbacks to the time when Drake was fighting with his girl at Cheesecake however though I guess I can give a slight nod to this track for being one of the more conceptual tracks and a sea of just non conceptual tracks with maybe the exception of the song Joe Bloggs which sort of takes us back to this point in grime history where grime is young Wiley is young he's going out to raves there's certain elements of fashion and music about the culture that he kind brings up in a really interesting way and that's actually kind of a recurring theme throughout many tracks on this album Wiley and grime are at a point where on this record he kind of gives us a bit of a grime history lesson making all these nods to other seminal artists in the genre certain points in the genres growth and history specifically moments that involved him other complaints with this record maybe a few songs on the back end like the song face feel a little muddy or just mixed a little weird with the vocals overpowering the instrumental ever so slightly and every version of the album that I have heard thus far features mistake in the tracklist the song birds and bars flows right into what is supposed to be the first half of the second track bring them all but instead we kind of get silence and then it continues and is six minutes long instead of just being that one half of a track that we're supposed to get bring them all it's supposed to fade into holy grime because the next track is titled bring them all / holy grind though that's really more of a technical complaint than it is a complaint about how the album sounds I mean if you're not paying attention you would just think you're kind of listening to another track but it doesn't skip over to the next track that's all a lot of the hooks on this record - are very solidly written from moments like lucid where Wiley is legitimately singing and comes through with a solid sticky hook - moments like Bang where we have guests sort of bringing through these nutty sort of very aggressive shadows at the top of his lungs flows where you just kind of interrupts with that very violent very crazy very off-the-wall one other glaring issue I have with this record is just that it seems to be that there are different lyrical standards in the UK versus the US and again that's not to say that we're like all lyrical miracles over here because obviously there's tons of trash rappers from America but there are a lot of moments on this record where I think Wiley comes through with these really basic rhymes with absolutely no word play or deeper meaning whatsoever and maybe that has a lot to do with the fact that he's rapping so fast on these tracks it's really more about the sound of his voice it's really more about the vibe of the tune than it is you know a need and urgent need to like rewind the track to be like whoo did you really say that shit but like with a rapper that people take super seriously over here you're not going to get a bar like like if an emcee breaks down I told them like a car which kind of just made me imagine like Wiley's head on the top of like some Thomas the Tank Engine style tow truck as he just like drives rappers away or used to blaze weed eat food get the giggles see me in a sweet shop looking for the skittles like an emcee who's trying to sound hard and sound super serious like we would not say these things but having said all of that Wiley's real powers found mostly in the fact that man sounds sick on a rythm bro not only that but a lot of his lyrics are incredibly personal real and they kind of give you a full portrait of the man who he is I do love this album I think it's one of Wylie's best I think this album makes for an exciting moment in grime and I think in a way it could be a good introduction to the genre in general because not only does it just have the trademark sound of the genre I think Wiley brings so many exciting tracks in this sound I think you bring so many different varied styles in this sound and if you dig deep into the lyrics she kind of get a bit of a grime history lesson because all these points that he's referencing all these artists that he's referencing you could easily go back and look them up and learn more about the genre here more records that are of interest I'm feeling a life decent 8 on this record tritscher transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best or the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave it Angry comment if you're angry this Wiley album thought it was great there are some albums videos next to this video next to my head but I think you should check on if you're into this album my brain isn't working right now that's why I can't talk so Wiley Wiley Wiley please

the Internet's busiest music nerd guy and it's time for Vampire Weekend now fires of the city Vampire Weekend is a New York indie pop and rock outfit who annoyed me on their first album captivated me with their second and has had me patiently awaiting the release of their third this now for better or for worse Vampire Weekend has easily been one of the most standout groups in indie pop over the past handful of years the band's fun pop hooks are seamlessly blended with classical music style Arrangements colorful production and instrumentation with a lot of personality and texture the band also has the capability to play tracks that are incredibly fast loud sort of noisy but still very fun and playful and occasionally they'll drop a bit of musical elements from sky muzac or reggae and singer-songwriter Paul Simon influences coming from his solo stuff has shown up stronger and stronger and stronger as the band has released more material and most of these elements show up once again to create a pretty worthwhile sequel to the band's last full-length LP contra and I say most of these elements because the band does change up their recipe a little bit on this new LP Vampire Weekend subtracts the world music element out of their music in a really big way on this release none of the tracks on this album really come through as being influenced by anything more than Western popular contemporary and classical music which is kind of strange because sounds coming from ska and reggae most notoriously have helped the band to find their sound since day one but it would seem on this new full-length LP the group is really trying to get their songwriting to stand on its own two feet and not be enjoyed relative to how many steel drums or thumb pianos manage to show up on a given track and for the most part Vampire Weekend does bring lyrics and Mel that are up to the challenge of this change with refined instrumentation with a very strong classical music vibe to it the band will occasionally throw out tracks that are adorned in strings or very beautiful chorus vocals I mean gargantuan chorus vocals which show up most notoriously on tracks like yeah hey or on the track Hudson one of the closing tracks on this LP that actually on top of the course feels as if it's backed up orchestral II the production and effects are just as dynamic on this LP as they were on contra and the lyrics are romantically poetically passionately descriptive on subjects such as life love and a really big topic for this new LP religion God it would seem almost as if this subject matter comes up on most of the tracks on this album in ways that are subtle and not so much like the track obvious style that kicks this album off which through its melody and it's chord progression has a huge gospel vibe the track features a somewhat borrowed melody but the band is able to keep things interesting musically by evolving the instrumentation as the song plods along bringing in more and more electronically tinged sounds but still managing to keep the track feeling very delicate refined and beautiful it's like a sunshiny morning day morning the track unbelievers also has a very strong religious tone to it with Ezra throwing elements in his lyrics that reference unbelievers sinners fate and being bored again the instrumentation has a really fast peppy pace to it that really really reminds me of moments from Paul Simon's Graceland same with the track worship you which has a very steady gallop to it and even though the song does add an incredibly catchy chorus this track really really caught my attention when Ezra threw the lyric out there that will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the Train and one more note on this LP in relation to religion the song yah-hey has to be mentioned it's one of the longer tracks on this LP and obviously the chorus on this album could sort of be a plan words for the word Yahweh and lyrically the song seems to be somewhat of a calm conversation directly with God sort of displaying this loss of faith with certain groups of people on this track much like on the song unbelievers Azra paints this difficult picture with religion this difficult personal relationship this desire to believe or this passion for the will to believe but there's something sort of holding him back or at least the person he's singing from the standpoint of a relationship that I think most people with a modern mentality have with religion due to things like modern science and contradictions and holy texts or just long unanswered philosophical questions though I'm sure many out there with an internet connection can easily point out the faults of religion still it doesn't make this song feel any sort of less heartbreaking for me especially since Ezra's performance on this track seems so sincere however if there is a downside to this track it is the annoyingly chipmunk vocals which pop up all over the already strange and slightly obnoxious chorus on this track in a way it kind of reminds me of the track California English from the band's last full-length LP which a lot like yeah hey was overall pretty good tune a tune I really want to like but then the band incorporates this really sort of obnoxious element into it kind of ruining it for me as much as I love Vampire Weekend because of their boyish vocals their ability to woo me with their lyrics and their beautiful melodies they're playful light-hearted yet methodical instrumentation the band occasionally breaks this love streak by putting out a track that I just can't stand not that the band should take my personal taste into account when writing music but there are tracks on the cell P like finger back which in my opinion is from front to back annoying it's the constant staccato instrumentation that never really seems to relax until the band reaches a bridge which isn't even that interesting to me and the melody that is being played with the staccato instrumentation and edge we're singing on top of it essentially results in no the docs go found love but fluffa Shep and she averted a gaze the melody is so freakin jumpy I kind of want to just try my best to grab at it except it's so repetitive throughout nearly the entire track I just lose interest the song worship you also sort of loses my interest as well by being just a little too hmm the verses on this song are so speedy that Ezra's words all sort of blend together in this really unrewarding way you know a vast majority of the songs on this LP are enjoyable like the very eerie moonlit and epic track Hudson toward the end of this LP the song is fantastic it's like a battle epilogue it's it's really just a big finish for this album outside of these sort of short shrug like semi instrumental tracks like step and Diane young I have sung their praises in the past I still enjoy these tracks quite a bit but I still can't help but feel like to an extent around the halfway point of this album the album sort of loses steam and gets kind of spotty first off you have the song everlasting arms which in comparison with many of the tracks on this album the annoying ones and the good ones just kind of feels like wallpaper doesn't really stick out in any significant way and then following this you have in my opinion the three most annoying tracks on the LP back to back to back still the the first half of this LP is is great it's incredibly solid it just seems almost as if on the second half of this album they didn't really want to copy themselves whether it be their past material or just the earlier material on this LP so they started to wildly experiment which I guess is okay in a sense because it did bring this album variety but then all of a sudden it drops off completely emotionally with the very downtrodden and subtle quiet Hudson which does finish epically but it feels as if there's a complete stop in terms of flow on the album at this point and the band just completely changes gears and then puts out a really short track to kind of close the album out in my opinion definitely not as much cohesion track for track as an album like contra I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Vampire Weekend [Music] "},{"id":"I_UJ-3yakDg","title":"Brand New - Science Fiction ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hey everyone Brandon he news hello here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of brand news return record science fiction this is the latest full-length LP from New York rock band brand new long considered to be one of the best bands in the emo scene although the band stylistically is much more than that it's kind of disingenuous to just simply label them as an emo band in fact when they were just an emo and a pop punk band that's truly when brand new was at their worst their best albums also incorporate elements of post hardcore acoustic and alternative rock indie rock packing all of these styles into these very passionate well crafted albums from start to finish and honestly I even like the experimental and abrasive turn the band took on their last album in 2009 dayz which in my opinion is a little underrated the band has essentially dropped three very good albums in the 2000s and have been in the midst of a studio album silence ever since until last year when fans were hit with news of the band getting back together and writing new music and that caused excitement understandably because I could really only imagine brand new coming back together unless they were going to add something that was essential to their discography and science fiction certainly does feel like a worthy addition to the band's musical canon it's a chilly despondent very ghostly album dynamic like a devil in god but the lows the subtle lows of this record dig even further into like a very dark emotional abyss mostly thanks to tracks like 137 and desert let me up the very moody intro to the song same logic even with the heavy guitars and the kind of Queens of the Stone Age style vocal harmonies that are very tight very sweet very catchy on the song out of mana which have kind of a devilish quality to them that I think is kind of specific to this album and brand news catalog it's also worth noting this is the band's longest album to date at 61 minutes but still in the midst of all of this long-winded gloom the band still finds ways to work in some pretty anthemic tracks like the song same logic / teeth that I mentioned earlier which reaches an incredible instrumental climax one of the few spots on the album are you actually get any scream vocal that kind of callback to the band's past couple of albums and their emo and post-hardcore influences also the song can't get it out which sounds like this mid-paced powerful mid-90s alt rock power ballad the lead vocal melody as the guitar sort of ascend with these heavy pounding chords is so amazing and substance oh passionate easily the most emotionally stirring spot on the album however the bulk of the record is really taken by these somewhat quieter and more subtle cuts they're very dark they're very sparkly which is perfectly fine that is if the band's writing and performances are enough to convince you on these songs I however and not completely sold on a lot of these tracks I mean for sure most of them if not all of them are well mixed and assembled and structured but what a lot of these tracks boiled down to are just some very middle turn ative and acoustic rock that seemed almost like they could have been written twenty years or so ago and most of them don't really deliver much of anything that feels all that memorable or exciting to me outside of an almost mandatory climax that some of these songs have to reach in order to justify the first three or four minutes of frozen bleak rock music tracks like waste and 137 come to mind and lead vocalist Jesse Lacey his singing on this album seems a little less distinct in my opinion less gripping than usual I mean he's never been one of the most unique singers as far as rock music and the 2000s goes but at least the emotion of his performances on day shalwar were captivating here instead on this new record most likely to fit with the very low-key vibe of the album he's playing a super flat and I'm not exactly sure if that was the best way to sell these songs like could never be heaven or the intro and outro track so the record which just slowly fall into the background for me the lack of energy coming through on Jesse's singing seems even more apparent on louder cuts like no control where the band just kind of sounds like some unenthusiastic post-grunge group doing their best Nirvana impression which is one of many moments on the album strangely enough that sounds like some kind of cleaner moody or more steam take on some of the alternative rock of the 90s which has certainly been an influence on the band's music before but on this one it seems like a really weird combination this record is simultaneously very cold and very modern but also at some points feels like an exercise in 90s nostalgia occasionally some of these quieter cuts do get graced with a more passionate vocal the song desert for example some of the harmonized background vocals on that track really do make the song what it is but even though some of the vocals on this thing are kind of lackluster the band does bring quite a bit of instrumental variety to this record so it's not like they're really kind of lacking on that front like the droning kind of distorted guitars and the area almost Mellotron ish keyboards on the song waste or the somewhat bluesy guitar licks all over the song 451 you know in its entirety this album is very listenable and after multiple lessons I would even say that a lot of parts of it are memorable even the refrain on the least attention demanding track on the entire album the closer is somewhat sticky ultimately the issue for me with this album is that I'm not really feeling much of it it's well put together everything sounds very balanced and there's not a single track on here where I could say the band literally is doing nothing and is merely just phoning it in but maybe this album is a band maturing to the point where if kind of lost that original spark or bite that made them appealing to their fans in the first place at least to a degree because a lot of the time I think my reservations on this album sit with the tracks or the band is really taking a risk going in this very dreadful fearful very melancholy direction which certainly seems to be the case when you look at some of the lyrical and implied themes of this album sadness loneliness paranoia mental illness I almost get the sense that the album's takeaway is that there's nothing scarier than one's own mind and maybe I'm reading too much of album I don't really know I mean it's a concept that seems like it's coming through to me it's a concept I agree with but for whatever reason it's just not really hitting me because a lot of these softer cuts to me don't feel super despondent they just feel really safe the songs are implying the depths of emotional hell but I don't feel like I'm being taken there and that's pretty much what's holding me back from going absolutely crazy about this record even though if there are a lot of technical and fundamental elements to it that I think are really good very quality but the emotional presentation and performance just really aren't 100% there I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next if it likes if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment

it's time for a review of the new weakened ep my dear melancholy the weakened if you didn't already know is this huge gigantic internationally known alternative R&B vision from the mind of singer and songwriter April Tesfaye who began making waves much earlier this decade with a trio of mixtapes that created a ripple effect a sea change in the R&B scene that we are still feeling the the force of today regardless of how I personally feel about a lot of material on these projects did love echoes of silence though did love that but Abel's music his commercial releases since then in my opinion have been kind of inconsistent bulky a little all over the place or at least in the case of KISS land super one-dimensional and unaddressed almost kind of sucking out that risk factor in the experimentation of his earlier tapes Beauty behind the madness was just super inconsistent to me but still had some moments and some fantastic singles like can't feel my face love that track and while I didn't really love his latest star boy either I did get the sense on that record that he was taking a lot of risks pulling out all the stops pushing himself outside of his comfort zone trying different musical styles while not every risk on this album goes over well and it is a really bulky and and just bloated album it does come with fantastic songs such as the title track with Daft Punk which brings us to this new EP which at the end of the day I feel like is one of Abel's safest releases since kiss lands pretty much every sound and every song on this record feels to me almost like we've heard Abel do it before just this severe sense of deja vu across six tracks 20 or so minutes the song call out my name while it does have some passionate vocal highs it kinda has a vibe and a swing to it similar to that of earned it off of the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack at least to me maybe the instrumentation isn't quite as ritzy but I feel almost as if Abel is kind of painting himself into a corner vocal this track the song try me is is barely even worth acknowledging not just because the try me try me refrain is really obnoxious but also that the post-production the effects on this track leave the song feeling so washed out you could barely even engage with it the song wasted times puts abel over this very fashionable somewhat bougie very european dance beat it's definitely new for him not something we hear him sing over every day but does it do wonders for his style not necessarily the two tracks featuring production from Gustav Holstein I hoped would provide a little bit of a break up between the other tracks maybe just a different direction or something but honestly the they do no such thing I mean the song hurt you which I do like it does kind of have a groovy slow moody nocturnal instrumental behind it it feels almost as if I'm listening to the weekend tried to write another song over an instrumental that vibes very similarly to that of the starboy instrumental there are even a few lyrical moments on this track that are some of Abel's worse namely this point in the song where he is singing about not wanting to be between someone's heart but between someone's legs which makes no sense how do you be between someone's heart I mean if you're gonna tell us this story that you've told us a million times over that you're this bad boy lothario who loves them and leaves them and you're not romantic and you come the night and your druggie and you you treat your lovers badly I mean at least try to use some more interesting and sensible language to to describe the tale may be the most lyrically compelling moment on the entire EP is the closing track privilege which while it doesn't have a whole lot of musical structure to it feels kind of like a motif it's one of the shorter cuts on here does give some intimate details of able kind of realizing hey maybe this relationship that I'm in is kind of toxic it's bad for me I got to cut myself out of here or this is just like a negative thing for me to be involved with I've taken two red pills to take away the blues I've come to realize like I'm Khanh how bad this relationship is and I'm gonna fuck the pain away overall in the CP I'm just feeling kind of indifferent toward it I mean this is some of Abel's most uninvent wrists material yet however I'm not really reading into that too deeply as far as what he's going to be doing on his next project really what this feels like is just a series of somewhat passable just good enough to want to release tracks that could have fit snugly into any number of Records that Abel has released years ago but maybe we're just redundant or not unique enough to sort of throw on to the fire and the reason I feel this way is that these songs don't really do much of anything different and if Abel has set a tone for anything across his entire discography it's that with each record he does make an attempt to challenge himself and push in a different musical territory this EP unfortunately does not do that however I think hardcore weakened fans who sort of just loved his sound the way that it is don't want it to change don't want him to switch things up too much we'll see a lot to like here but for someone like me who's looking for him to maybe do something a little bit more novel or at least like right up to the standards that you've set for yourself in the past because honestly like as far as lyrics as far as the tunes on this thing I feel like he's kind of sold himself short a little bit I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you are the best you are the best what should I review next hit like if you

basically said demonstrate oh you'd lose art and poetry and drama and narrative why worry are there are there no godless artists and poets there are artists and poets who think their godless all right hey everyone the Internet's wettest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kimber album primal heart this is the third full-length commercial album from New Zealand native Kimbra whose career was hugely boosted in the earlier part of the decade with an appearance on the smash breakout art pop hit somebody that I used to know Kimber dropped a pretty decent debut album the very same year titled vows a record that showcased quite a bit of vocal talent and artistic versatility there were really kind of kooky jazzy sort of tongue-in-cheek numbers on here like the song good intent but there was also very summery lavish baroque pop on this album like on the track something in the way you are and instead of when moving on to her next album kind of cutting things down and finding a more defined a more focused sound Kimber sounded even more all over the map with her follow up the golden hour in fact there were some tracks on here like the song 90s music that I think had even weird or production some of the beats on here were pretty synthetic kind of Spacey as well a lot of sub-base a lot of booming beats but still a lot of room for Kimber's vocals the kind of ruminate I got the sense that some of the songs was in the production on this record almost felt like an attempt to keep up with fellow Kiwi Lord who blew up and had some viral hits just a year earlier on this album there were also some nods to contemporary hip hop production with the rattling high hats and the tight snappy snares and the huge sub bass but in the tracklist on this record Kimber still left a lot of room for stylistic detours like the disco rager miracle or the song madhouse which is essentially like this 80s throwback synth funk anthem that just seems to be Kimber's thing on each tracklist she has dropped so far there just seems to be a library of pop Styles embedded within not only that but she also tends to wear her influences on her sleeve to the point where I think her past couple of albums kind of lose a sense of continuity and identity her music can come off a little nondescript if she's drowning in a particular influence or if a vocal performances may be so-so or a song is kind of generic and that's still kind of the issue on this new album over here as well where I feel continuously caught by who it is it sounds like she's copying as opposed to what it is she's actually doing because throughout this record I hear hints of the knife and SIA and Lorde and maybe a little bit of Radiohead or James Blake Kate Bush she really seems to be loving some little dragon on this one there are a number of very pillowy dreamy glossy synth led art pop tracks on here that maybe aren't the feistiest and the tracklist just seemed kind of mild like the song like they do on the TV which features a very sensual sax part as well as the good war and everybody knows and black sky some of which are decent cool down moments in the midst of the tracklist but are clearly overshadowed by some of the more vibrant and feisty er songs here with more tangible and upfront vocals especially top of the world super exciting primal track even if the song just bleeds fever ray just sounds so much like Karen jury or Anderson but it's like she's taking that influence into a brighter more manic more egotistical direction with these hypnotic dirty drums and really distorted heavy synth bass it's a track that sounds simultaneously ancient and futuristic and not a bad tune either I'm having a hard time describing some of the vocals on this track though because it doesn't purely sound like singing it's also kind of a I don't know a shouty or a spoken word type thing either way it's intense and portrays a ton of character much more than some of the other tracks here do the song recovery is really sharp blend of trap and pop with this really heavy bouncy bass synced up with these just gigantic chords some really sassy lead vocals I love how the drums kind of pick up a little bit as the song progresses along and the song has some really cute vocal harmonies is well hanging in the background and it's essentially this really summery track about getting over a bad relationship recovering from that and I guess giving yourself a little time for self-love learn to love yourself learning more about yourself instead the song human is one of a few tracks on the album where Kimbra is like a dead ringer for little dragons Yuki Mian igano especially with some of her more subtle croons on this track and in the background vocals it's got kind of a different instrumental and songwriting style though because little dragon isn't really much for the type of tune that we're hearing there which is really dark winding and urgent slowly blossoming into this really explosive chorus the song light year sounds like a forever 21 shopping spree set in the year 3000 with all these throbbing pulsating driving since and sequence drums occasionally the scents get a little visa there's also some really glossy orgasmic chords on the chorus also some of the best singing on the entire record too I mean when Kimber squeezes out that one no inner upper register before the song blasts into the hook the song right direction is a nice tune it's one of the better ballads on the record certainly not as washed out as some of the other more low-key tracks here it feels like a very intimate little tune set in the mid 80s with a very heavy and powerful string back to ending good progression the song past love I like the vibe of this track a lot there's something about the instrumentation that feels kind of dreamy and nostalgic much in the same way that you might find like on a she and him or a Best Coast track but it actually feels not too nostalgic it doesn't feel dated it doesn't feel trashy it feels classy feels sharp it feels smart my real issue with the song though is how are you going to have two summery pop tunes on here about getting over an old relationship and then emphasizing that that you need to focus more on loving yourself instead which leads me to another criticism I have with this album that lyrically topically it can be kind of surface-level you know there's some limitations here the song version of me helps pull up the rear of this album and helps end things often stereotypically sad and dark fashion but it's actually not a bad track it's kind of a painfully intimate claustrophobic ly close piano ballad that sounds like it could have landed on Radiohead's a moon shaped pool which love that album I think the song is pretty good it's not really an influence I mind hearing pop up even if it does kind of add to this albums lack of consistency I will say though the real closure of this record that comes after this this two-minute little vocal interlude with some weird James Blake ish vocal meshing that does not go over quite as well and almost feels like a cop out of an ending still though even at its worst this album is very listenable there's not really anything on here I outright hated there wasn't anything so bland so plain so average that it just felt gross I mean even the more low-key cuts on here while they may not stand out while they may not be super vibrant they still have decent choruses decent vocal performances that I find myself coming away from humming I just wish the actual production and performances of these tracks were a bit more interesting and lively because it's not merely that these songs are low-key I mean the song human is a pretty low-key track but the way that the synths are produced on that track the way that the vocals are kind of twisted into these very dark alleyways it's incredibly creative it's a really interesting sound which is not something I can say for some of the more washed out songs in the tracklist still there were more highs than lows on this mixed bag of tracks which kind of runs like a compilation because still to this day with album after album there is still really no common musical or sonic thread that pulls all of Kimber's records together as an artist she's a bit of a chameleon kind of an all-around or a Swiss Army knife she does a little bit of everything and I will say with years of practices seems like everything she's gotten a little bit better but without a specialty or a trademark sound it still kind of feels like as good as this album is it's missing that extra spark that little extra something I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head

REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new bonobo LP the north borders bonobo is a uk-based electronic music producer who blew up a bit in 2010 thanks to his full-length album black sands which came after a pretty steady stream of full-length albums and EPS which reached back to the early 2000s and even though black sands was sort of the entry point for a lot of people to bonobos music bonobos style was pretty well established by that point bonobo typically puts out very subtle shellacked and groove based electronic music it's very beat heavy sometimes very downtempo and slightly hip-hop influenced and the progressions of the tracks that he creates tend to be a little more hypnotic than they are climactic now considering in 2010 that other popular electronic music albums were caribou swim as well as for tetes there is lovin you the climate the musical climate was definitely ripe for an album like black sands however I can't really say the black sands was resonating all that deeply for me on a personal level the downtempo and trick pop sounds that would pop up on this LP the micro house influences as well just very minimal simple and Airy spacious grooves that it was putting forward and the occasionally jazzy undertones of some of these songs to me the songs on this LP just felt very pretty very relaxing and that's all I can really say about them and maybe that's all that bonobo was really trying to go for however I can see very clearly that bonobo is getting a little more ambitious on this new album bonobos music on the North borders still feels very beat driven it's very serene it's very understated but the sounds definitely feel a little more vast the atmosphere is a little bit bigger and the vocal guest that he brings on to sing on a handful of the songs on this hour-long LP are a little more impressive in terms of performance and and name wise too because he does managed to nail a feature from the one and only Erykah Badu on this album as well as some lesser-known who give some very good contributions as well I have to say on this album bonobo continues to display the beauty that was always there in his music but it's turned up a little louder on the North borders a little to the point where it can occasionally become aunt inspiring like the opening track on this album which has a vocal contribution from grey Reverend who I had not heard of before this track and man am i sad about that that that because his voice sounds beautiful on this song he sings wonderfully or this very delicate instrumental which has this sort of rolling snare on the start of it and the way that it builds up it feels almost like a post rock song until the beat really kind of kicks in with this very low and subtle bass in a way this point in the song kind of feels like a drop but it's not drop into like oh let's rage it's more like let's ah the strange synthesizers the thumb piano the strings on this track it's all beautiful as far as the other vocal features on this LP go of course Erykah Badu's song is a complete standout her very sort of nasally odd vibrato voice is very calming and it's seductive on this track and slides into bonobos style just perfectly and this track is wonderfully colored with awesome strings some harp it's very much electronic music but on songs like this bonobo breaks that mechanical feel that typically comes with this genre and just lays on layer upon layer upon beautiful layer to the point where you're hearing something that sounds not electronic but very organic in my opinion bonobo really steps up his production game on this album when it comes to a song that features a guest vocalist even one of the tracks in the middle of this LP Towers which doesn't have the best vocal contribution on the entire LP still sounds beautiful because the vocal is complemented so well it's really just cradled lovingly in all of this awesome guitar these watery scents and again more ascending instrumentation which just makes me feel like I'm floating on a cloud however other tracks on here that don't feature vocals like m'kay and and Sapphire for example while they're not terrible songs they just kind of feel like passable tolerable future garage inspired productions that I would have in no way been able to guess where bonobos if my life depended on it even the song no you which has a slightly harder groove to it is kind of breezy and forgettable as well I know that bonobo doesn't want to make hard aggressive fast music that just hits the listener but I feel like there's a line separating subtle music and just forgettable music I think the only instrumental tracks on this LP that I really enjoyed were 4:1 Cirrus which I hope I'm pronouncing earlier it was the first song that was dropped before the release of this LP I love the way that bonobo uses space the thumb piano and this really undeniable groove on this track to make a song that is just hypnotic and the song don't wait has a sort of similar quality to it as well with some nicely placed vocal samples chopped and chopped and chopped in but I just feel like this level of detail doesn't show up everywhere clearly from listening to this album bonobo has very good taste in vocalist he has this ability to maybe expose some vocalists that can give great performances that maybe people wouldn't have heard of otherwise and when he works with some great vocalists there are some real flares of ambition and beauty on the north borders however many other tracks on here the instrumental tracks especially I can't really say there anything much more than just Pleasant and on top of that I just feel like there weren't enough to warrant an entire hour of music on this album but here's another opinion hey everyone you're number one calleman here capture Cheston here to say is sometimes Anthony doesn't know what he's doing you know here's the sang and maybe a nice sang but he's like yeah yeah when anthony hears sweetness sometimes he don't get it so that's all I gotta say that's it ooh if you do like your beats if you do like your electronic music a little quieter a little more subtle maybe you dig on producers such as nutria beasts as well as slum Oh bit of burial as well you may totally dig on this LP but just don't expect bonobo to be as gloomy or as experimental I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it bonobo the North borders forever [Music] you [Music] "},{"id":"_TZBdHjgMxI","title":"Alt-J- An Awesome Wave ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review all J an awesome wave LJ is an eccentric indie pop band hailing from the UK this is their debut full-length album and not only is their name alt-j but alt-j is now my new favorite computer command I think the video looks good like this you know I don't think we necessarily have to change it I mean you know this could work these guys came out with their full-length album earlier this year and then they landed a record contract and they also landed on the mercury prize shortlist and they came out with the album on this side of the pond now in the US and the band certainly came into this album with a focus on the bigger picture and I like that because they have a variety of sounds and feelings on this album there are a lot of sounds on this LP you know lone acapella chorus vocals piano twangy guitar leads fat distorted synthesizers strings glockenspiel occasionally some electronic elements adding up to some beats in the songs I mean these guys really kind of not jump around sporadically but but actually blend in a really interesting way elements of indie pop punk rock funk as well even baroque pop and this LP could really have become kind of a mess of senselessness you know not having a really clear concise sound does make it a little difficult despite that these songs can be pretty catchy to wrap your head around an awesome wave and despite the fact that all J does take inspiration from so many places eyes eyes eyes eyes I think they string all together really well with it with a pretty creative colorful and playful attitude mixed with some some very nasally vocals they are a little strange and with the accent that they are being sung with they are without a doubt I an acquired taste you know but I do hear command and range and control of pitch in the vocals but you know honestly my first reaction to this band as well was not all that positive I mean quite literally maybe my first reaction was what is this crap you know I just kind of feel like I'm hearing a lot of similar familiar in the tropes with some very annoying vocals thrown on top and you know it's true the band does travel through some familiar territory I've seen them compared to wild beasts but I think there are other comparisons that that are even more relevant for example Devendra Banhart and ward though the band does have some some comfortable characteristics I think it is they're pretty progressive approach to songwriting that puts them in kind of a lane of their own they really do write tracks that have numerous phases to them and shift from one idea to the next are kind of winding but still remain catchy creative and just loaded with personality the track Tesla is maybe the first track that hits me on the album is being really lovable one of the bigger singles from this LP if I'm right there's a very dramatic piano intro to the beginning of the song and then when the beat comes in the track gets kind of heavy it's equal parts acoustic electronic but still maintains just a really smooth smooth characteristic they're all these kinds of unpredictable spurts of sounds swirling around the music and the lead singer of this band is really just to me a character you know there's a moment in the lyrics of the song when he's like I'm sniffing there's a point later in the album where he kind of does a similar thing with breathing the track breezeblocks that comes in right after is a song that I think is similarly interesting though it did kind of rub me the wrong way at first there's like an opening guitar line that really makes me think of like a sublime song or something like that and the vocals kind of singing semi maybe even sort of rapping over this guitar line also you know ooh but it really kind of grew on me I mean the band does have personality they keep things fun I love how in the midst of these lyrics and in the song you're kind of getting these syncopated drum and piano hits you know you'll kind of get this guitar riff and then Dada Dada and we'll go back into it and I love the layered vocals toward the end of the track when the song really shifts changes up the riff and you're kind of getting these vocals jumping on top of one another these don't go please don't go again it's just character it's just personality it's it's like the band is hitting you with that on nearly every track here the song Matilda is is a very kind of nicely layered lullaby I mean very pretty and the song Tarot is a really well developed closer that doesn't so much jump you into different areas or bring up any huge surprises but it just kind of grows and grows and grows and grows until the point where you're getting this pretty heavy beat with the sound of some kind of plucked string instrument maybe it's sampled and looped on the track maybe it's performed it can't quite tell but it has kind of like a Middle Eastern flavor to it that I like a lie and it's just incorporated tastefully without really kind of taking away from the overall feel to the album when it's it's clearly something coming from a totally different place you know I didn't have a ton of complaints with this LP I felt like the first half of the album was kind of disjointed to me the song dissolved me has a really fat synthesizer that I've heard on another track of this album but there it just kind of feels a little out of place maybe a little overbearing in comparison to the rest of the music and the song to me something good kind of meanders a bit it's one of the softer tracks on here but doesn't really come at me with with a melody I really kind of fall in love with maybe it'll grow on me with more listens or something like that I feel like they had the potential to go even further with their idiosyncrasies and just kind of really build something of their own but in the meantime while that isn't 100% there the band does have some really kind of creative fun imaginative songs every song is just kind of like a toy chest in and of itself don't let the fact that it kind of feels familiar on the surface let it slip by you I'm feeling a light eight this album for sure really one of the more fun LPS I've heard this year but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana all J forever [Music] you "},{"id":"XV6nHQJMe7g","title":"Gorguts - Colored Sands ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"my needle drops Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Gore guts album coloured sands space bears bears bears bears bears bears these guys are a Quebec death metal outfit whose discography spans back to the late 80s in the beginning the band used to make death metal that was a little standard for the genre but increasingly they got more and more technical and experimental until the band put out obscura in 1998 which for a lot of gorgets fans is is really a peak for the band with riffs and song structures that were incredibly dense dizzying brutal intense the band stuck with roughly the same sound and direction for their next full-length LP and ended up calling it quits for a little bit after the unfortunate suicide of their drummer frontman Luke LeMay went on to concentrate on other creative endeavors including negative ax but now the band has come back and has returned with two surprising additions from the newer world of underground metal Colin Marston and Kevin Hufnagel who you may remember from bands such as dysrhythmia but I have reviewed much more Colin stuff on this channel like his work in Crowley's or behold the arcticus and of course he's done production for numerous metal bands out there including liturgy Colin and Kevin are incredibly talented perceptive and technical but there are a lot of listeners in this older world of metal that haven't exactly openly embraced them even though it is pretty obvious that bands like gore guts influence the things that they do in groups such as dysrhythmia to a high degree but now it seems like the tables have turned and Colin and Kevin are influencing the gore guts sound on this record or at least the modern metal landscape is now there kind of seems to be this element of atmospheric sludge metal coming into the mix slowing things down a bit making things a little more paced heavy ethereal I would actually like in some of what's on this record to a band like ulcery a group that is known for being credibly incredibly dizzying without busy their songs are and just how intense the technicality of the instrumentation is but but above all of this mayhem and just fast-moving brutality there is this cloud of Darkness that just encapsulate all of it and now gorgets as well sounds brutally complicated but monstrous and size on coloured sands as far as the sound of this record goes I'm in love with it I think it's fantastic the drums they're tight stellar execution on these things they have a lot of punch but there is that kind of flatness that a lot of modern death metal drummers shoot for however I don't mind it the playing the performance on this record feels so human it feels so fluid it doesn't feel overly robotic or just too rigid to feel exciting I love the rolling double bass drum kicks on this thing and the cymbals add a nice metallic splash in the background on here - Colin Marr Stinson's bass on this thing a ton of treble not a lot of low-end frequency coming through on this thing which isn't really a terrible thing usually I like my bass to be a bit rounder a bit warmer but it really makes his playing stick out among all the mayhem going on with the drums the guitars and the vocals and you kind of want to hear what he's doing especially considering some of the lines that he's playing how interesting they are the nice counterpoint they bring some of the intervals he's playing it adds to coloured sands in two ways it makes it more complicated musically and brings it a little more abrasion Luke's vocal sounds stellar I think he's proven that he still has it in a big way on this LP he still brings immense amounts of intensity and fire with his just guttural throaty growls the rhythm guitars to me are all right they don't really stick out in terms of an amazing tone or a unique tone in my opinion there are spots where that more atmospheric sludge metal vibe comes through brings a bit of heaviness it sounds good but to me it's really the solos and and the lead guitars that kind of make this record so colorful and so interesting they're just so bright and sharp and ear piercing however they can be kind of quiet toned down and tender when they need to be as well and there are moments where they need to be because Gore guts work out quite a few dynamic on this thing like the song ocean of wisdom which has this very sad mournful guitar interlude right around the middle of it which sees gore guts kind of moving toward a more coherent side a more easily digestible side as far as musical composition I think gore guts still writes some really intense and technical songs what I think is going on is that they're kind of making this huge ethereal musical backdrop for all of it so that it all ties together a little bit more there are other spots on here where I'm finding gore guts to be very enjoyable but also surprisingly coherent like the title track on here or the song another face which starts off with these very slow depressing arpeggios heavy droning chords that soon build into these intense and dissonant grooves and riffs that yeah are kind of weird and are off-kilter but the band plays them out so fluidly that it's easy to just have a really quick physical response to it it's cerebral and it's visceral and I still think that Gore guts brings some very noisy and technical surprises on this LP like the opening track the guitar layering at the beginning of this song is just so difficult to grab onto and make sense of and the guitar solo at the end of the song embers voice maybe one of my favorite solos on this album is really melodic but is harmonized with another guitar to be very sinister and twisted there's also a pretty impressive string piece that pops in into the middle of this album that is really tense it's dramatic I'm loving it actually man saves the most crushing blow on this album for the last track which I love with riffs drums and vocals it feels like the bandage is throwing everything that they have into this single track making it just oh a beating beyond measure while still kind of maintaining that technical composure that we come to expect from their songs but I think coloured sands kind of comes down to is that for Gore guts this record is very melodic but it's still dark it's sickening it's just brutal I feel like a lot of death metal bands kind of forego and neglect melody a little bit for the sake of being more brutal for the sake of being noisier and I feel like what Gore guts has essentially stepped forward and done is proven that you can embrace melody in a big way but still make a record that is just evil as hell I do kind of have an issue with this album being a little too dense at times and I feel like as long as Gore guts was going to step out be a little more melodic experiment with some of this string work why not even take two three four five steps further into the experimental abyss just totally do something whacked-out however maybe that's just me kind of demanding more because I'm incredibly excited by the talent in the writing the production and the performance on this record it's just all so good from front to back I wish it ventured outside of its comfort zone a little bit more but Gore guts have pulled together an incredibly solid record on this one I'm feeling a strong 82 a light nine on coloured sands but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is about it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Gore guts coloured sands forever "},{"id":"Kr_akDq7CMY","title":"Anderson .Paak - Malibu ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hey everyone west coast tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Andersen PAC album Malibu Anderson pack west coast singer and songwriter producer and he's been making quite a splash lately lending his very passionate raspy dynamic vocals to projects both big and small dr. Dre's latest album slash soundtrack as well as even the new bus driver mixtape and given all of this newfound attention of course this latest project of his is is going to be a breakthrough for him at least on some level and you cannot say that Anderson not tried to do it big on this thing given that he's handed over an hour of material 16 tracks on this thing with features from Rhapsody the game schoolboy q as well as bj the chicago kid Talib Kweli and more and on this project pac sounds deeply influenced by the institutions of funk jazz hip hop pop R&B all of which kind of blends together into a very smooth neo soul flavor some of the time and there's a lot of that kind of stuff to go around these days however many of these new faces aren't paired with very strong voices unfortunately but the vocal performances here are actually really good but I sort of knew that was going to be the case going into it given how many great vocal features Anderson has laid down in the past the singing on this thing it's full of emotion it's got a lot of charisma swagger occasionally it's seductive he's far from sloppy and I would say anything but boring and the 16 tracks on this thing are somewhat diverse as well as Anderson and his producers kind of hopped from one genre to the next I love the glossy futuristic funk grooves on the song am I wrong feels very new feels very modern but then on cuts like put me through and celebrate even though the production here is pretty fresh it's pretty clean that the core of these tracks there's like a class 6ol single and anderson dips into rapping as well on this thing over a couple of beats that are very jazzy fractured produced by 9th wonder specifically on the song without you on this track not only are the verses very fun very entertaining but anderson brings his own chorus too so of course that's good because you know he can sing and given that there a few tracks on here he produces he's just like a triple threat on this thing and then there's the very lovely and alluring song room in here which is probably the sexiest track on the entire record the chorus vocals on here like a hot breathy whisper in the ear which is set against these very grand piano loops the pianos are just like pure champagne on this thing the games feature here is pretty good I love Anderson's jumpy and jazzy vocal melodies on this track and if you were to doubt the sexuality of this album that I think you should listen to the song waterfall which there's a lot of innuendo there especially given the open parentheses inter Lube addition of the title there wink nudge nudge generally I would say I enjoy a lot of the lyricism on this record Anderson is a little more clever and I think playful than your average R&B crooner these days and they're actually quite a few cuts on here which aren't really love themed or anything like that they're actually quite personal and sort of go into Anderson's past either growing up or his struggle as an artist the highlights on this thing continue like on song come down which has a five-star bassline from play right bank there's a mean drumbeat behind this thing to over this track Anderson really unleashes his inner James Brown it's really a hot cut on the album for me even though the song and the beat I think do get a little redundant over the runtime of the track and it seems like they didn't really know where to pull the song next outside of this very funky groove which might explain why it's so short in the tracklist here but that's kind of the case with a handful of songs on this thing either the verses transition toward very underwhelming choruses or Anderson and his producers just kind of rely on almost one sing lube to carry himself from one end of the track to the other and it makes a couple of cuts here stale and in addition to that there are a few songs in the second half here that I think are so smooth they're so breezy they're just kind of forgettable regardless of the quality of the lyrics on these tracks like parking lot or life way and then there's the closer which it's it's a nice warm ending to the record but I got to be in the mood to listen to it because it's so sickeningly sugary I just think there are moments on this record that could have done with more live instrumentation like the very tight sequenced synthetic production all over this thing while it does have its nuances it doesn't exactly set the subtle and dramatic tone that I think some of the softer cuts on this record really needed and the song your prime kind of stuck out like a sore thumb to me because it felt like a slower more skeletal less extravagant take on one of the interludes from Kendrick Lamar's to pimp a butterfly there are a few moments here where I think Anderson drowns and some trendy sounds unfortunately my main issue with this thing is just that I think there's a lot of fat here that could have been cut some songs that were very obviously lackluster and could have either been built upon or just I don't know left out for an EP or just made bonus tracks or something but having said all that there's still a lot to like on this record there's a lot of material here most of it is great just not every single song here in my opinion is a hit or concisely it are very sharply written it sounds like Anderson is so close to something great and something stellar on this album so as a result I think the shortcomings there are on these tracks are a little more obvious I just think on the next release cut the fat and turn up the heat because I think some of the hotter heavier more in a way aggressive and just swagger laced tracks would have picked up the intensity on this thing would have picked up the momentum I think would have made it a little more entertaining but still regardless I do recommend that you check this thing out it's a great funky hip hop fused soul record I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album oh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best Anderson PAC Bala boo forever "},{"id":"cn00K4FqQRE","title":"Princess Nokia - A Girl Cried Red MIXTAPE REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new princess nokia mixtape a girl cried red princess nokia is a new york rapper and songwriter who kind of blew me away with the deluxe edition of her 1992 EP last year who if you heard that EP you know stylistically artistically she's really all over the place not just indulging in East Coast kind of boom-bap style hip hop trap rap stuff that I guess is a little bit more on the pop spectrum as well she's not one of the flashy er rappers you're ever gonna hear but one thing that just made her stand out for me was just how eclectic she was and not just in her music but also in the personality that poured through in her lyrics a one song or at least a couple songs that really stood out on that deluxe version of that EP were these tracks where she would make reference to goth culture and not just being interested in it but being a fan of it being a participant and now it seems like that element of her personality is being deeply embraced on this new project over here where she's kind of bringing back this old-school mall emo mall goth fibe but delivering it over this mostly atmospheric kind of dreary trap style production very much in the vein of an artist like little peep in a way and she's pretty much singing all over the entire project I mean it's a huge change of pace it's certainly not something that I would have expected her to do like this is just totally out of left field which in a way is positive and way is exciting that we have newer artists out there who are willing to take huge gigantic risks but when it comes to the execution on this thing I'm not so sure I'm that into what's what's going on with girl cried red for one princess Nokia's voice is kind of odd to say the least it's a little nasally she comes through some weird vocalizations every once in a while but it's not really anything that was too difficult for me to get past however her singing on this record to me just it's very rough and it's very awkward and I'm not really sure what else to say about it not only that but she keeps repeating this line throughout the record this mantra about her heart being broken and Pia and it looks good there on the floor which I mean if this were a hard-hitting line or a bar like I could I could really see it popping up on the record as much as it does as some kind of like theme or mantra or tribute to the sound that she's shooting for but it just kind of feels like a mere one-off lyric in the biggest song on the project it's almost like I'm listening to a glorified single surrounded by a bunch of half-baked tracks that are just all kind of shooting for the same sound because stylistically the EP is really consistent and maybe to a fault because it feels almost like Nokia is trying to write the same song again and again and again and again and while I have no doubt that Nokia is a fan of the cultural movement she's obviously pulling from on this EP it still doesn't change her performance and and the music on this thing from feeling like she's just merely putting it on as window dressing to make some sort of statement or give the audience the impression that she's doing something entirely new or weird when really it just kind of sounds like a bunch of sad trap songs but now it's it's with a slipknot shirt on I mean if this is gonna inspire you go go all the fucking way just like just bring new metal back man just do it I I'm kidding I know that's never gonna happen but still I guess I'm just puzzled us how this EP managed to get out I mean it just seems like there's really nobody saying hey listen you might need to go back and work on this or like maybe this this isn't really done because the whole thing just kind of feels like trap goth pastiche and and really that's it there's there's nothing that much deeper to it the the shows of emotion the depression the sadness it all feels very surface level the production is pretty generic and across the entirety of the project very say me the vocals leave a lot to be desired the lyrics leave a lot to be desired I really wouldn't have even known this was a princess Nokia release had I not been told at its worst moments this thing sort of borders on unintentional parity and it feels like Nokia didn't put nearly as much focus on the sound of this project as opposed to the presentation of it because while that whole new metal an alt metal and like emo scene was definitely my shit in high school this record totally fails to make me nostalgic or even remember that in a positive sense at all yeah unfortunately this tape really fell short of my expectations for this new direction this this new sound for nokia but hey she's so eclectic and so all over the place I'm sure her next project isn't gonna sound anything like this so I guess there's always that to look forward to I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this tape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if

Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Solange Knowles album seed at the table Solange singer songwriter producer younger sister of Beyonce returning once again to add an album to her kind of inconsistent discography every few years Solange seems to reappear out of the blue to release another record with an entirely reinvented sound and style whether it be from her 2003 commercial debut which took more of a radio-friendly R&B approach than moving later to the kind of futuristic R&B and pop blend that she would drop in 2008 with that record soul angel and then in 2012 with the EP true which was mostly produced by Devante hines of blood orange fame she was putting together some very ethereal pop and soul music but in 2016 with a seat at the table she returns to toy again with the sounds of neo-soul R&B and pop and her sound is still relatively laid-back but there is a strong and underlying political message that links many of these tracks together in the recent past Salon news music hasn't really left much of an impression on me much of it just being a little too faint and Spacey and while she also takes a subtle approach on this new album as well there is a newfound elegance to her singing into the instrumentals on this record that I found to be pretty stunning Solange seems to find some great power in this incredibly hushed and calm soulful music the nimble bass lines very gentle string sections the rich pianos and easygoing rhythms on this record all come together really nicely the instrumentals are quiet but they're not so skeletal that there aren't little details that you can eat up and they're refined enough to have intricacies but they're not overworked to the point where they lose their natural groove and feel super stiff and lifeless and the songwriting and the production credits on this thing is like a serious who's who of pop music of hip hop of soul music we have Raphael Saadiq we have q-tip on this record David long strengths of Dirty Projectors Fame Questlove is in the mix as well and there's just way too many to name there's a lot of people going into this thing but this pretty diverse array of talents come together to create a pretty consistent and uniform album the flow I will say though is a little odd given that many of the tracks on this thing are a series of what sounds like interview Clips conducted with a variety of people one of them being master P who I have not heard from in years but it's kind of cool to hear him on this thing all talking about issues of race and culture black empowerment a lot of the politics and Solange's music are playing his day in her lyrics but it just doesn't hit you over the head as a listener because her tone of voice and a lot of these tracks is so soothing listen to the song FUBU where essentially she's talking about cultural and racial boundaries within art within music talking about certain artistic expressions specifically this one being specifically for black people are being a celebration of black pride or with the song don't touch my hair which is obviously in reference to the much blogged about microaggression Solange on this track is framing her hair as her emotions her crown is this personal thing that it isn't for someone else especially someone a white person specifically to be coming over and just asking to touch as if it's like something to just be casually curious about the stress of racial tensions in America seems to be dominating Solange's every thought on this record whether it be on the song mad where she's singing about her constant state of anger over issues like police brutality and the like even though inadvertently she's kind of also singing about how much of a wet blanket she is as she's mentioning people who don't seem to get why she's so angry there's also a semi goofy little wayne verse worked into the track that i do in a way commend because he does stay on topic he does kind of flow into the theme of the track pretty well Solange's vocals on this cut are surprisingly passionate too and the stuttering groove of the track the choppy piano chords as well as the kind of odd vocal harmonies which are very nimble just jumping all over the place we're clearly a work of David long strength and I went into the liner notes of the record only to confirm that pretty quickly the song cranes in the sky seems to be an extension of this same madness the same stress that she's singing about but she's trying to bury her blues and buying clothes and sleeping and reading and having sex all of which is set to some pretty gorgeous strings and a very slick drumbeat but even though this is a social and a political fight that she feels the need to pay attention to or take part in on the song borderline she illustrates her need to take a break from it every once in a while with these lyrics right here and then there are points on this record where she takes the political and she turns it personal like on the cut where do we go which is a reference to her family having to move from their hometown which was sparked by her father getting stuck in a salt mine her family having to pull him and someone else out and then the mine only rehiring part of her family back which created tensions like a split in the family Solange does pick up the mood of the album a little later though like on the track Junie which is sort of this upbeat playful fight song of sorts which features this Jackson 5's funky piano bass breakdown on the hook which is complete with some falsetto vocals from Andre 3000 singing jump I wanted this track where do we go cranes in the sky all kind of come together and make for some of the boldest instrumentals on the record but I enjoy many of the subtle cuts off this record as well not just one of the big singles from this thing don't touch my hair but also some of the opening cuts like rise and weari which kick the album off with a very mysterious and almost eerie mood the only songs on here that I'm not that enamored with are the ones whose instrumentals awkwardly blend elements of soul funk and electronic music like on the song don't you wait whose beat sounds super flat and I don't know kind of robotic considering just how human and silky the vocals tapped with this instrumental art and the song don't wish me well while I really like the intro to this track what sound like pump organ chords were really doing a great job of setting the tone Solange's vocals on this track sounded great too but as the track developed these kind of thin echoey bouncy guitar lines kind of entered the mix and they're super kind of tinny and to me sour the mood of the track altogether but the rest of the record here is pretty beautiful tasteful Pleasant given my experience with Solange's music in the past I expected myself to be kind of bored but I actually wasn't there's actually an interesting juxtaposition going on between the music and the lyrics a lot of the instrumentals being so serene and blissful while the lyrics addressed some seriously rough social topics and angry and fed up feelings personally coming from Solange or self while I may not always agree with the mindset that fuels the politics of this record much of it is pulled from Solange's personal experiences which honestly I can't really argue with and I don't really hear anything all that disagreeable about the lyrical content of the record or many of the interviews that segue one song to the next throughout the album I actually think a lot of it's pretty inspiring even if I don't directly identify with the identity politics of this record because the themes that Solange references of pride and self empowerment and being the change that you want to see in the world are all pretty refreshing and I can't really deny that a great deal of this record is well written well performed and well produced - and I guess I can unequivocally say that this is Solange's best album today as well so even though maybe it is a little too easygoing at times and I don't find Solange to be the boldest of vocalists out there right now I had a really good time with this album I think it's a beautiful record that I have no problem saying that I feel as strong 72 a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen is your love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the light if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this Solange record there's some

Flatbush zombies album 3001 a laced Odyssey michi Darko zombie juice and Eric Ark Elliott New York's Flatbush zombies and this is their independent commercial debut independent no label bitch I loved the Flatbush zombies last mixtape better off dead it made me come around to them I was kind of underwhelmed by drugs but better off dead solidified them in my mind as a really eccentric colorful rap trio who were incredibly gritty super in your face very distinct personalities among each person rapping in the group and with this new project over here I was just hoping hear everything that I've loved about the Flatbush zombies up until this point just may be refined into a really concise record as better off dead was kind of lengthy a little all over the place stylistically and emotionally maybe something a little more focused this time around on this commercial release would be nice while also kind of just sharpening the unique characteristics that have made Flatbush zombies so good now 3001 is a much more focused project at just 12 tracks and features an amazing front cover from mr. David Nakayama which to me is fitting because I've always seen the Flatbush zombies voices as cartoony sort of animated but unfortunately the excitement of the cover here does not translate into the music itself the record does have a pretty decent start though with the track The Odyssey a song that is as druggie as it is murderous the production on this thing is really ethereal it's kind of mystical the drums are pretty prominent but not so punchy that they're aggressive there's some pretty nice since bass on this thing some dramatic piano arpeggios there's something about the chord progression and the bass line on the beat that also reminds me a little bit of King Crimson epitaph pretty cool and Eric and juice and Meech all deliver these mid-paced flows with some non-sequitur verses just to kind of give a taste or as to what you're going to be hearing on the record Meech sounds especially devilish this track talking about how he writes rhymes or he does raps that causes Jesus to question religion it's one of the longer tracks here and I actually think it justifies the length immediately after is the song bounce which was a lead single to this thing and within the context of the record it's not bad it sort of fits the very smooth and ethereal vibe of nearly this entire album so it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb or anything and I really like the song r.i.p CD which features this grimy boom backbeat and is matched with these really dreary jazzy keyboards just really soft instrumentation that's just much just sadder than the percussion it's being backed by and the refrain on this thing is kind of funny as the Flatbush zombies essentially kind of lament the death of the CD as a popular physical medium for music juice comes through the very speedy flow Eric in his lyrics challenges other artists to do something different with hip hop he claims to see how formulaic other artists are in contrast to what Flatbush zombies are doing and Meech while I don't really mind what he's doing lyrically it seems like he comes through and his vocal mix is just way out of whack with what everybody else is doing bocalee he's just so much louder and it might partially have to do with just how he delivers his vocals he is easily the loudest the raspy Asst the grimy guy in the group so taking special care to make sure that his vocals aren't swallowing the beat that they're actually mixed into the beat and that they're not clipping or anything that just kind of needs to be taken into account I mean is a unique vocalist kind of like an ODB and after this track a majority of what's here feels like it's severely missing something the Flatbush zombies just kind of navel gaze over a series of tracks that are very spaced out and somewhat uninspired and I think the root of this issue might have to do with the production Eric's production on this thing in comparison with drugs and with better off dead especially better off dead is lacking the layers the bomb Basset II the detail and the colors that I've heard before somewhat disappointing it might partially have to do with an overall lack of very meaty long samples worked into these instrumentals I know that when you're doing a commercial release it might be harder to you know get samples cleared and to make your songs based purely off of samples because of all the licensing issues that can arise maybe that's what's going on or maybe Eric just wanted to take things into a more synthetic direction either way the end result here is just a series of beats that have much less punch much less oomph way less excitement and in a way it sounds like Eric could have produced most of these instrumentals with one hand tied behind his back like on the song a spike Lee joint while I do like the additional saxophones on this track those are nice the drum pattern the percussion the groove on this track is painfully lazy my ears just kind of glaze over on it and the songs take off good grief and new phone who dis are equally as lifeless when it comes to the instrumental I can hear Eric and Meech and juice doing their best to fill up this space and give us expressive verses with a lot of conviction but there's only so much they can do to sort of close this gap between their vocals and the production and what's kind of weird is that these tracks here are kind of the comeback moment on the record whereas the preceding tracks actually provide a bit of a breather kind of an interlude the songs fly away ascension and smoke break two of which are in an album so tight just completely unnecessary detours these tracks are even more spaced out than the general full-length tracks on the record so to just come out with a series of interludes that are just even more ethereal even more laid-back just doesn't seem to make much sense ascension does pick things up a little bit Meech does bring one of his most exciting vocal performances on the entire record he is especially aggressive here and I think this is one of the few moments where a more aggressive delivery does work over this very Spacey instrumentation that and the song this is it but there's very little or really just almost nothing here in terms of a banger or a track that I see having some serious long-lasting single potential which I've heard Flatbush zombies produced tracks like before in the case of thug pull and bliss this thing overall is pretty one-dimensional and sleepy and the hooks what few hooks are here aren't really anything to write home about either it seems like with the production having so much less punch that the trio wasn't really motivated to write choruses that really had a bang and kind of shook these songs out of there very relaxed and spaced out verses now I have no doubt that juice and Eric and Meech are still incredibly capable rappers I don't really have many issues with what they're doing lyrically or flow wise as well although occasionally I will say that maybe their flows do seem a little unsupported on some of these tracks with so many of the beats again being very laid back and not having a lot of punch I just think without great choruses and fantastic instrumentals and some good song topics to support them what Eric and Meech and juice here are doing lyrically just isn't enough to make up for the shortcomings of this record I think the ending here is decent at least the album itself is bookended by two great tracks I like your favorite rap song juice and me Chan Derek all respectively deliver three of their most amped verses on the entire project as on this track there being better supported by a more explosive instrumental with some pretty dramatic arpeggios worked into the beat it reminds me of something along the lines of mine fuck off of a better off dead which I think was pulled off a little better there but still it sounds decent again kind of revisiting this vibe here I will give it to the record that it is consistent much in the same way like that new boss record was very consistent in how smooth and sleek and just easygoing and just kind of very middle-of-the-road not too many emotional peaks or valleys it's just very consistent at this emotional level at this intensity level but to me that's not what makes a record entertaining especially a record from Flatbush zombies a group that I know for being so explosive and over-the-top a group that I know that has a ton of character a ton of flavor but for whatever reason that flavor that character didn't show up in the beats and didn't show up in the songwriting here now I know that for a group that does it independently I know for a group that is underground it can be really difficult to just transition from a mixtape to a commercial record so I don't know at least in my own mind I'm going to kind of chalk the this album up to that and just hope that whatever they put out next is a little bit more in the red a little more risky I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it and what do you think I should review next Anthony fan 1005 push zombies 2001 at least i2c forever "},{"id":"1bkP7n6RhSk","title":"Primitive Man - Caustic ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new primitive man album caustic this is the second full-length album from Denver Colorado doom metal trio primitive man this thing is out now on relapse records and I first heard of these guys when they released a debut album scorned back in 2013 it was easily one of the heaviest ugliest most nihilistic doom records I'd heard that year it was very abrasive I also caught the band live at a bar by the train tracks they were even heavier and nastier in person they just had this head spliting sound but as as powerful as it was it was all still kind of OneNote I thought that scorn as an album experience was a bit of a slog and that the EP they followed that up with was was just kind of okay now as far as expectations go leading into this album I liked some of the promotional tracks but I guess I was hoping that primitive man would find a way to maybe change their sound up a little bit become more versatile or maybe pair the record down to its best most essential moments maybe think about writing songs that are a little more memorable and in a conventional sense however a primitive man didn't do that on this new album over here and and it doesn't matter it's really good instead primitive man do the exact opposite they come through the record that is longer it's like 77 minutes it's louder it's heavier it's noisier they're going more abrasive than they ever have before and the experience is pure punishment it's musical masochism straight up no daylight chained to a cold concrete blood-stained floor and each song is a different blunt object you're being beaten to death with like a police baton or a crowbar or a pipe wrench this album is surely destructive on a physical level with its massive weight it's crushing Distortion but it's also kind of destructive on a mental level to the guitar tone on this thing is abusive the vocals are hellish it feels like I'm just being sucked into a deep dark abyss from which there is no escape there are no sort of recognizable markers to tell me where I'm going or if I've been there already the sensation of this record just relentlessly wears me down and puts me in a mood where I just want to watch the world burn to ash for sure this album is less memorable than its predecessor but only in a musical sense the slow pacing of a lot of the riffs here the constant dissonance how consistently loud and sour the guitar chords are it makes it difficult sometimes to decipher where exactly things are going because outside of this usually slow pace of the record you have the occasional mid-paced sludge metal riff for maybe a riff or some chords strumming that reaches a top speed of 25 miles an hour with a hulking blast beef firing away behind it that's not to say that the album is one-dimensional not completely and that's not to say that the album isn't memorable it is it's just that the impression that it leaves is more of a sonic impression it's more of an emotional impression I just find the aesthetic of this record so stimulating it keeps me on the edge of my seat even if it's going slow even if it's kind of you know consistently loud and abrasive like the the burning distortion on this thing is searing it's like a dead flesh hitting a red-hot grill at a BBQ hosted by Satan the drums are huge dramatic mostly simple but very muscular playing and the bass on this thing also has this really deep grimy distortion to it that reinforces a lot of what the guitars are doing the vocals guttural growls kind of mid-level shrieks it's really animalistic it's like the band is literally using the sounds of doom metal to summon a demon or something the experience overall I think is pretty exhilarating it's it's really like a cleanse whatever's inside of you this album will beat it out of you it'll wring it out of you and then afterwards it'll throw you in a wood chipper just because in that sense they really do go above and beyond when they really could have just hit you with a shorter record with some you know blasting guitars and some fast drums and just kind of called it a day no instead primitive man really wanted to make sure that fans walked away from this album with no faith in humanity left and honestly when I listen to this thing I find myself enjoying it and viewing it from the angle of like more of a drone album more of a noise album or like a sun record just kind of letting the huge monstrous sound of this album wash over me and letting it's impossibly dark and nihilistic mood crush my soul also given some of the weird abstract noise interludes here as well as the very strange eerie and Spacey closer my guess as to you know listening to it more like a noise record or a drone record kind of makes more sense compositionally the the album is deceptively simple because if you actually look at what's going on as far as sound play with the subtle introduction of extra guitars and more distortion and more layering as a lot of these tracks progress there is actually more to these songs than may meet the ear unlike an initial listen because while the band isn't really doing anything that flashy in terms of writing though there are some interesting chord phrases on this thing they do successfully create an album that feels like I'm just being swallowed by sound I loved it honestly I don't want to spoil too many specifics of it and just kind of give you guys a hint as to what mentality you should have going into this record again I will say just like their last album this record is a little OneNote it is a little one-dimensional even if I do kind of enjoy the constant and enveloping harshness and drone enos of the entire album and that's not to say that I think the band needs to start writing you know catch your licks on the guitar or anything like that though maybe a stronger melodic element would bring a grandness to their apocalyptic sound the point I'm trying to make here is that if being is extreme and as abrasive as possible isn't the name of the game then I would love to see primitive man take it even further I think this album is going to be a good listen for anybody who enjoys a little pain with their pleasure and in a funny way I feel like this album sort of sums up a majority of my emotions for the year of 2017 except for the music though that me the music has actually been very good for the most part I'm feeling late to decent 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Li subscribe and

ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone bring thyn a death tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new absol album do what thou wilt absol Top Dawg entertainment zone abstract asshole one of the more interesting artists on the labels roster in my opinion and that's because he's a bit of a conundrum he's hard to categorize he's not quite as highbrow as conscious as a guy like Kendrick but it's not like he makes totally lowbrow or ignorant music either and I don't think he inhabits some kind of middle ground or middlebrow area with his Tunes either I actually think absol wordplay the way that he structures versus his one-liners are all really smart but he typically uses his talents to say something really trashy and kind of hilarious he's basically the kind of artist who would say something like this an atom is a molecule and atom was a mighty cone but if he would have never ate the Apple he'd be mad sad and would have never pulled the leaves off of Eve and seeing all that ass also this wonderful line over here that he says about the American flag is a doozy which doesn't seem to be a part of some kind of greater context or anything like that he just kind of puts that nasty little bar out there not to mention all the weird philosophical contradictions on this album absol seems to be on both sides of the aisle of a few different political issues most notably feminism or women's rights are just basically the treatment of women in general but this is an issue that he returns to numerous times on this album I mean maybe not so much that it's the concept but it's certainly the most prominent theme on this record and he talks so much about it even though some of what he says seems kind of ridiculous there has to be something to what he's he's trying to do on this record he has to be building some kind of point or at least maybe being purposefully inconsistent as a way to fuck with the listener he will write a song like threatening nature where in the lyrics he will question the fact that black women got the right to vote after black men but then he'll have no problem whatsoever with like sexually objectifying women on a later track even the song now you know ends with a pledge to the he-man women haters Club and women Naga me is one of the weirdest concepts for a track I've ever heard I don't even know if this is offensive or if it's progressed progressive I'm not even again sure absol were kind of smudgy on this record they're difficult to pin down I mean even on the song Braille as he repeats over and over on the refrain that everything's been done before nothing's original yada yada then he comes straight out to say but you've never heard it like this and even if it seems like absol is sticking to one idea or taking himself all that seriously on this album there are a couple spots toward the end of the record where he employs some serious conspiratorial stoner logic like on the track evil genius but for the most part on this thing absol is playing it sort of tongue-in-cheek and difficult to read like on the song invocation where he directly repeats lines from the track Bohemian Grove from his big breakout album control system and then immediately in the midst of repeating those lines repeating that refrain he stops himself he interrupts himself to say oh I have a heaven I've been here before haven't I said this before there are plenty of moments on this thing where he's creatively offensive as well like on this gem of a line back to reality sadly I'm actually Jewish or whatever Jewish to call me of course this comes right after a line about sucking Jesus's penis on Venus and there's a wonderful bar on the song beat the case where he raps about beating it beating it beating it like a runaway slave the lyrics on this record are highly quotable but they're all very kind of tasteless and have a similarly dark sense of humor kind of reminds me of Eminem's sense of humor from back in the day but of course updated for 2016 and tagged with the type of head in the clouds third eye otherworldly mindset that you can only get from ab-soul which even on this record itself he parodies a little bit like on the song wifey versus Wi-Fi where he makes reference to you texting him if you have your third I phone this album is is odd man it's weird just like absol it's difficult to pin down I don't feel like it's this conscious head II listen or anything like that but it's it's not a casual listen either this album is dense there are a lot of twists there are a lot of turns there are a lot of lyrics that even though they may be making a dirty joke once you get to the nitty-gritty of it you actually have to think of the bar you actually have to think of the lyrics and how the wordplay works in order to really get it there are all sorts of tracks on here where there's like a weird detour toward the finish that's actually pretty interesting some very experimental and progressive instrumentals odd flows now this isn't always for the best the song gods a girl feels kind of disorganized a shovel not all that well-structured meanwhile the track now you know is a little aimless in my opinion feels a little kind of redundant the verses don't contrast that well from the choruses but not every moment on this record is blatantly left-field there are plenty of tracks on this thing where the hook is really catchy or the flow is really catchy of the song raw that kicks the album off absol comes through with this kind of slow lumbering slurred flow that I remember pretty vividly from that waka flocka flame song mo n ey from his flock of le 1.5 mixtape which he might have gotten from somewhere else I'm not entirely sure most likely the case but that's what it directly reminded me of when I had heard it also Braille incredibly catchy Huey new then incredibly catchy and it feels like absol in a way is making more accessible music without sort of making those mainstream commercial music concessions that he did on these days I get that maybe in a sense he was trying to parody some of the mainstream rap that he was toying with on that record but it seemed like he was coming so close to making it in the midst of creating that parody that he was just making that music if you get what I'm trying to say here and as much as I didn't really care for these days I did come away from that project feeling like there was something to it still though trying to make something with a more commercial edge isn't something that absolutely given up which is most definitely the case on the track of the law with Mac Miller and Rhapsody and which features in the background a very glitzy glamorous jazzy smooth instrumental and then one of the other lead singles from the Trekker drugs is a super catchy track and not really a banger or an aggressive track or all that poppy of a cut in my opinion it's a very slow moody ballad that takes a rap singing angle that I wouldn't have imagined solo to pull off as well as he does on this cut it's very woozy it's very intoxicating I enjoy the sentiment of the song to his love his passionate love for drugs really comes through outside of that I don't know if there's much else I want to say about the record I do think generally the last third is the weakest point of the album some of the songs least likeable tracks and most messy tracks come through there and just generally in the second half I think the album starts off really strong features some of AB Souls best and most creative and off-the-wall material there are a lot of great ideas instrumentals and verses on this thing but I can't help but feel like he's so close to coming through with a concept maybe inadvertently that once he realized he was just on the precipice of doing something maybe about the gender dynamics in the modern age because again he does bring up the male/female thing quite a bit then maybe he should have just taken that full step and just done it but then again being preachy like that isn't really absol demo you know there are just a couple tracks on this thing I don't care for because there's not that much oomph or viscera to them they feel a little unfinished or the topic that comes through isn't all that clear or in the case of the last song on here ymf the flow is a goofy a little silly comes off kind of amateurish but for the most part I think absol has come through with a good project big improvement on these days takes more risks drop some clever and funny bars successfully pulls off making a record that is left-field is odd is kind of on the fringe but I think has a pop sensibility to it and hopefully moving forward he continues to challenge listeners with his mix of creative instrumentals thoughtful wordplay but a very dirty dirty words I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this album Tran then have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry Anthony Fantana

everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd looking a little crazy and it's time for a review the new self-titled LP from c'mon c'mon c'mon these guys are a Bay Area punk band that has been at it for about ten years at this point and they've got a load of LPS as well as some EPS and splits to show for it and the band's progression over the years hasn't really been a radical one or anything like that they pretty much this whole time have been fine tuning their vibrant combination of hardcore punk and screamo with a bit of an eccentric flair coming from their melodies and their background vocals which at times can be kind of circle takes the square inspired and typically the band writes a decent amount of detail into their short overly emotional and kind of aggressive rock songs which I'm surprised hasn't really earned them more praise than they currently have over the course of their career in a way I'm not surprised because for a lot of screamo fans the genres heyday is kind of long gone at this point with bands like page 99 and envy and circle takes the square and gospel not really putting out genre-defining material anymore and screamo isn't exactly a genre that's been known for its innovation I mean it's it's pretty set in terms of stylistic elements mostly because of how extreme the genre tends to be still despite all of that baggage kumara actually presents a nice set of hooky melodic punk tunes that feature a lot of keys and fiery guitar leads a bit of piano and a little brass too I actually think that on this LP there may be just enough elements of harmony and melody to the point where this album could crossover with people who aren't necessarily fans of screamo music because there is a strong element of balladry on this new self-titled LP that wasn't exactly as present on the band's previous material it's like the band was able to bring their usual amount of ferocity to this album but they still ended up bringing a bunch of tracks that sound like they could have been hammered out on an acoustic guitar and then brought to the studio so since it's or at least you know kind of turned into acoustic songs and it's not like the concept or the idea of the song would be lost in the process but as far as stylistic elements that's pretty much this album in a nutshell as far as bands that this kind of reminds me of I mean just the punk anger yet the melody and the extreme vocals of this album really kind of reminds me of strangely enough of being like growler Talk of course there are a lot of recent albums on Death Wish records that have a strong post hardcore screamo vibe that are totally walking down the same path as this new LP and I wouldn't be surprised at all if these guys took maybe a little bit of influence from like early against me records in the process of writing this LP before I get into what I love about this album too deep I guess what I'll say my main issue is a lot of these more melodic elements that the band is bringing into these songs it's it's very clear that this is sort of a new aspect to their music or a newer aspect a still-developing aspect their songs out here they have about like quality but sometimes get cut a little short maybe it's because the band is kind of you know ending things due to their Punk brevity that may be the case but I still end up kind of thirsting for more tracks like the moon which just has this rowdy infectious Fulk punk inspired energy to it that feels like the the sweat and the energy of a thousand basement shows or it could have felt that way before it kind of ended up ducking out and just not really developing past a verse and a chorus and it just ends up kind of feeling like maybe one basement show with a semi awkward cliffhanger the song dragged blood brings a hornet to the mix but it just kind of lazily hangs or these distorted guitar chords and the verses like a really unwanted smog cloud it just plays like this kind of boring ascending and descending melody that only consists of a handful of notes and it's really not that fiery or passionate in terms of performance it doesn't really add any real drama to the track - like the end of the song really and there are a few other spots on this LP where keyboards are just kind of applied very weakly as well even though I do have some issues with several songs on here they don't exactly ruin the tracks for me just maybe make them slightly underwhelming because even outside of this extra instrumentation the guitars the vocals the drums I mean all of that is really well performed energetic just enthralling there may be some downs on this LP but when the band hits the mark on this freaking album they hit it like I don't know a monster truck a monster truck host a monster truck the single on this LP coldrain with its syncopated guitar and drum hits as well as its guitar leads is really anthemic and between the bass the guitars the drums the vocals when all of them come together and like lock into a riff and a groove there's just so much power and energy and thrust thrust thrust thrust I mean that's that's yeah that's a nice thing this album has going for it that's also but what I love about the track must be nice the song starts off with these clean deeper vocals which are okay but a really awesome contrast to the screams that are you know most prominent throughout this entire LP and when the electric guitars and the beast finally kick in with full force and volume the song just speeds off just grabbing me and pulling me along with it and the quickly downstroke guitar chords I mean this track is sort of like a pop punk song on screamo steroids I love the song king worm with this really kind of funky upstroke guitar groove and the way that the organ is is applied in this track really adds a nice touch too and the untitled instrumental track which is pretty uplifting is a nice song in here as well it really kind of develops blossoms really nicely and shows that the band can write a really layered track that is just way more engaging musically melodically than some of the shorter and more aggressive and leaner songs on here overall there's a lot more that I on this LP that I find underwhelming like I said some of the extra instrumentation does feel more ornamental than it does I guess feel like a vital part of what these songs are doing and on top of that I will say that coma Bros is most definitely not reinventing the wheel when it comes to screamo or anything like that these guys definitely make up for that with just straightforward great catchy instantaneously memorable songs that have a lot of replay value to them in my opinion they bring quite a bit of variety to all these tracks and this album actually has a pretty nice arc to it as well I do really feel like I'm traveling through a well-conceived album as I listen to this thing from beginning to end and did I mention that this LP does all of these things just around the 28 minute mark so yeah really really enjoyed listening to this loved listening to it I think I will most likely end up returning to it before the years out I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana go mad forever you

busiest music nerd it's time for an album review ceremony is a 5-piece from California whose music makes me miss the days when I had a mohawk not that you need a mohawk to enjoy punk music but yeah I gave it away ceremony is a punk band on this album anyway Rotter Park is ceremony's third LP and their previous two were much more heavy dense extreme lots of relentless drums on those records thrashy riffs kind of reminded me of DRI but much noisier maybe with a little bit of metal influence too of course those earlier records also display some punk influence but this new album is the tightest embrace of that classic 80s hardcore style that this band has ever done the stripped-down and somewhat tinnier sounds on this LP homage to some of the best hardcore california has had to offer like Circle Jerks and some of the darker and more experimental elements Black Flag introduced into their music on albums like my war but what I love most about ceremony and this record in general is that when you listen to one track when you listen to just a little bit of the album you know what you see is what you fight used to get there's this really crunchy bass in the mix that sounds a lot like chewing on a mouthful of stale cereal the guitars are really thin they don't have a lot of punch to them but they are just blaring and the vocals are just sliced piss just pissed is how vocalist Ross Farrar doesn't get really poetic but if you look at his words there's some stuff to think about there and as far as the vocal delivery it's just as urgent as the music going on behind it Farrar's voice is like lighting a piece of sandpaper on fire and then rubbing your eardrums with it there are some tracks on here that sort of seemed like interludes they're called the wayside parts one two and three and most of them consist of just some slower guitars strumming maybe some soloing maybe some vocal samples playing off in the background despite the fact that these tracks aren't as speedy or as intense as a lot of the other songs on the album they sort of seemed necessary to just add some dynamics to this LP to make it sort of seem like ceremony isn't just a one-trick pony on this album so long story short these interludes do not feel like filler as far as gripes on this LP go some of the tracks do have some sameness to them sameness of sound sameness of vocal inflection but you know what that comes with the territory when you're making this style of music it's a very defined style and doesn't have a lot of wiggle room this album didn't reinvent the wheel it didn't change the way that I look at punk music I don't think that's what ceremony is shooting for but it's really inspiring to hear music like this made with this much ferocity it's just uncompromising most modern Punk records only make me really want to listen to the old stuff just turn it off put on something that's older more classic more well-traveled something that we know is good this album is one of the rare occasions where that didn't happen if this is on I'm listening to this it's not like I'd rather be listening to something else I know there are some people in my audience who are not going to be into music that is this loud that is this crazy but you know I needed something like this to listen to music like this every once in a while it's refreshing it's like taking a bowl of ice water and just throwing it on your face it's like hey wake the fruits up yeah I'm not feeling a decent not a strong but feeling a light eight maybe a strong seven I am highly recommending that you at least check this out so if you want to clean your ears out with some unfettered rage or enjoy the comeback of a classic classic hardcore sound then this is where you want to be but if you guys are into this record or if you're not into this record let me know let me know why Anthony Fantan oh ceremony Rotter Park thanks for watching thanks for being awesome forever "},{"id":"1fvl1Yigl9A","title":"Ski

album you will regret it's really more of I guess a mixtape the but the ski mask the slump god is a florida rapper who's been making some noise online with some small-time hits some features with his boy XXX 10th asean he's got a few EPS out as well and I don't know how he swung it but while his buddy ex was getting all this promotion on the double XL freshman cover here we have ski mask getting this little thing over here released on Republic Records he is out here I open didn't have to sell his soul to get this thing out but I respect his hustle and I've been slowly kind of coming around on this thing at first I just kind of assumed it wasn't going to be for me nothing of interest here just another kind of ad-lib each rap rapper with not a lot of lyrical substance and maybe on the surface it does kind of seem like that I mean there are a lot of trendy instrumentals on this thing there are a lot of ad-libs there's a lot of very druggie sexual materialistic and violent lyrical content those ski masks does occasionally come through with some very quirky and strange wordplay but I don't know man there is just something about mr. slump God and it's not that he's actually a very talented rapper I mean some of the flows that he whips out on this thing are really fast dizzying intense and fun I mean he can be really precise when he wants to be and he's not just this emotionless slack-jawed moron either even on the low key cuts on this thing his delivery his performances are really expressive and animated and pretty off-the-wall I mean some of his vocal inflections on this thing don't even sound like he's in control of his own voice don't even count all money money can account amounting that's kind of like my weird tame impersonation of it like on record it sounds even weirder and some of the lyrical references he brings on this thing are really obscure they're nerdy they're strange a lot of very dark humor a lot of cartoon references a lot of horror movie iconography on the song Adventure Time he makes at least a couple references to Chuckie Cheese and there are a handful of earworm or frames on this thing that I just cannot deny and there's some really gross and just really unexpected similes on this thing too like where he's talking about is pockets being so fat that they have allergies or like they have cancer my bitchy hot my bitchy hot not that she hot my bitchy hot just like a stew just like my piss when it smell old I'm with bonobo hot like your pink okay all right all right I will say his style is kind of gimmicky and there's not too much to some of these songs that are mostly these very quick aggressive meanie hits of vocal wildness that just kind of dip before the two-minute mark and there is an interlude track on this thing that just sounds like a Travis Scott ripoff however though I do think with ski masks with slump God is doing on this project is kind of part of the course for what I talked about in that little yadi wraps Punk phase video because while I do come away from this thing leaving a little unsatisfied like there could have been a bit more to this thing I do think ski mask is bringing kind of a newer wild style I think he's kind of breaking down the fundamentals of the genre his music is kind of crazy and energized and visceral and takes a sort of rudimentary approach there's some true highlights on this thing in my opinion of the song that I referenced earlier just like my piss love the eerie lead melody on the beat in this thing the insane rapid-fire flow that slump God brings throughout this thing they're very slow and heavy bird is the word is almost like mutant in the way to slump got raps on this day I know the bird bar the word remembered by the word obviously a drug reference but the refrain itself is a reference to the trashman's song surfin bird' which is something I would never think I'd hear mentioned so overtly in a contemporary rap song but here we are and again just the tone of the really odd drawn-out weird vocals on this thing it's borderline disturbing and unsettling and the song baby wipe what is it with all these weird underground soundcloud Florida rappers right now like busting out these really fast funny very catchy flows there are a lot of weird overdubs specifically on this track it almost kind of hits a bit of a migos vibe that points I feel like I'm listening to like two or three different slump gods all at once on the same track all kind of going crazy it has a really disorienting and kind of overwhelming effect that I like a lot and the very high-energy h2o that ends the project off is a highlight for me too while I'm not really a huge fan of X at this point in time I can't deny that these two have a lot of chemistry together the rumbling bass and the very punchy beat on this cut helped a lot too I wish the song Rambo was a bit longer I feel like it's a good intro to the album and displays exactly what makes slump gods so appealing or so unappealing depending on what your opinion of this guy is because I don't think he's for everybody know the song energy is a bit of a snoozer there are bits of this song that I like but there are a lot of spots where there just isn't much vocal presence from slump God and it really could have used a little bit more of I don't know everything and the song ever took a tab in my opinion just doesn't add that much to this project that is already so short to begin with it's just 25 minutes or so and given that length it really should have been all killer and no filler on this thing and hopefully into the future I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping for more material longer more fully fleshed out songs wilder production more structure more experimentation getting a little bit more adventurous with the lyrics but as of right now I think slump God has a lot to offer with these really crazy wacky land wraps that he's doing and while it is very much an obviously flawed project I think that I don't know there's just a lot to look forward to hopefully as long as slump God continues to progress and evolve and grow and build upon what he's done here I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this slump God project to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best

Arab Spring here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Rae sremmurd record shrim life - Rae sremmurd they're not just the final words that you say when you succumb to the stroke that leaves you paralyzed from the waist down and financially ruins your family they're also a popular Atlanta rap duo who just dropped their second full-length LP now originally I didn't take the duo all that seriously when they broke with huge singles like no type and no flex zone songs that I thought were no good these singles of course led up to a pretty underwhelming album off this LP I was getting some serious crisscross vibes who I may add were also based in Atlanta when they were popular and were similarly marketed at the same hey these guys are really young but they're really popular and mainstream sort of angle I thought these guys would be like done in a year but they're they're back I mean the industry hasn't chewed them up and spit them out already so morbid curiosity got the best of me I decided to give this record a shot and I was honestly surprised surprised to hear that these guys were putting together some legitimately catchy pop rap with loads of production from mr. Mike will made it now I'm not saying this records a classic I'm not saying it's reinventing the wheel I'm not saying this is a smart album although you know it doesn't matter what I say I'm sure there's gonna be a comment down there saying hey hey you've rated this higher than blank-faced ah to boil it down this record is turn-up shit which in theory I don't dislike I think there's plenty of crappy turn up music out there that just absolutely sucks but this is some turn-up shit I can get down with even though they're not deep lyrics on this thing and really conceptual themes running throughout the album what I can commend Stremme life to on is that there are plenty of very energetic and charismatic vocal performances all over this thing the vocals come off a little less annoying this time around even though they are still kind of high-pitched and shouty and yell be still though the energy that goes into those I think is infectious a great deal of the time especially on tracks like shake it fast Oh shake it fast which features a hilariously graphic verse for mr. Juicy J himself I love the Bang & bass on this track the click-clack percussion it is a strip club anthem the duo also does well over a DJ mustard beat on the song set the roof which features a little bit of help from Little John himself I remember back in college I loved the shit out of that kings of crunk album I was blasting that thing everywhere all day I probably looked like a total loser and I guess I still do but whatever fuck it still with this that track was a little bit of a throwback and that was nice as the shouty multitrack gang vocals have a lot of energy the groove of course is funky it has that trademark little booboo little DJ mustard bassline and with the opening track on this thing yeah this album is a non-stop party it is a party that just does not let up it's throwing bottles everywhere it's flipping the furniture over it's climbing up the walls even low key tracks with deep nocturnal trap instrumentals are pretty engaging like on the song real chill with Kodak black which i think could have used a better chorus or by chance which I think has one of the better choruses on the entire record hundred bands in the land do you have one that chain and the tracks that feature sway lead doing these lead vocals which I didn't really care for on the last record sound eerie and kind of lonely here there's a weird sadness to them that I think is kind of appealing his little boy voice sounds so chilly amongst the smooth glossy synthesizers and Spacey trap percussion like on the song look alive or the song black beetles with Gucci Mane which I think has one of the most captivating choruses on the entire record which is a song essentially about blowing money fast because you're not planning on living too long I think there's references to like falling in love with strippers on this thing money raining slowly through the air it's a dreamy seductive track so again completely surprised to hear that nearly everything up until this point I had been really enjoying I've been enjoying myself listen to this record it's a fun album if you hate everything on this record you might not like fun I'm sorry I just find this record entertaining but at the last third this album turns into almost a complete bore the duo starts incorporating tracks that are total throw aways or take the album down a few emotional detours that are nowhere near as fulfilling as everything they've been doing up until this point namely the song do yoga total throwaway track no idea how it made the cut on the just normal version of the record especially since the bonus tracks on the deluxe version are all way better than this song there's a terrible lyric on this track about coming on to girls which was on the song came a long way the duo tries to turn their success story into a sub story and I don't know it's just not really all that captivating especially since the the allusions to their struggle and their come up just seem really vague and generic there's no real captivating specific details to kind of pull the listener in and make them interested in the background of Rae sremmurd the song now that I know is a really lackluster attempt at throwing an R&B jam into the record about relationship troubles I think this could have easily been one of the better pop rap records of the year but again the duo just does not pull through on the last third things go south pretty quickly almost immediately after the halfway point of the record but again up until that point a majority of the cuts on this album are fun to listen to it's an entertaining record don't go into this thing expecting anything huge anything ambitious it just features a lot of tight well-crafted bangers with some funny silly over-the-top lyrics that are all just written and delivered for a thrill and I would love to hear these guys continue bringing that vibe into the future and maybe if they decide to go down a more emotional route with some other tracks and the in the latter half of their next record hopefully they go into a bit more detail or have potentially gained the life experience needed in order to to make that kind of angle appealing or captivating I'm feeling a decent two strong six on strem life to transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best but should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you're pissed off about my thoughts on this record because you thought I was too positive about it or I was too harsh on it you know you're always going to piss somebody off but whatever Rae sremmurd Sharma life to forever "},{"id":"hWxnq5EYbZU","title":"The Bad Plus- Made Possible ALBUM REVIEW","y":2,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's Halloween Halloween Halloween Halloween review the bed plus made possible these guys are a musical trio that has remained difficult to accurately categorize over the years puppies blending elements of experimental music with jazz rock pop and doing cover songs of modern and mainstream classics long before the dudes and bad bad not good we're doing Odd Future reinterpretations now I first remember stumbling upon these guys in college hearing covers of theirs like Black Sabbath's Ironman or Nirvana smell like teen spirit and that did catch my attention and I was able to you know kind of get into other covers of theirs at the time or just they ended up putting out later from blondie Queen Interpol Pixies I'm pretty sure they covered David Bowie as well and despite the fact that I've always liked the idea of the bat plus and have been I guess consistently impressed with their musicianship I always thought their covers really overshadowed their originals and their cover songs never really stuck with me past the novelty of the first couple listens however recently the band has been working more and more to kind of stand on the merits of its own material instead the LP they put out a couple years ago their last album never stop was their first full-length LP to feature just originals and one of their albums prior to that suspicious-activity actually only featured one single cover a cover of the Chariots of Fire theme written by Vangelis and this new LP goes down that same road only one single cover ended is the last track the paul motion song Victoria which is really one of the most obscure songs the van has ever revised and I actually think the bad pluses recent focus on original material has kind of revitalized the band because not only are they playing with some pretty refreshingly experimental ideas on this album but there are actually elements of electronic music that make it out of this LP as well through the sounds of synthesizers drum machines and some weird experimental glitchy electronics as well and even as there is a lack of covers on this new LP the band continues to blend genres rock pop jazz avant-garde jazz free improvisation as well as progressive rock - the track pound-for-pound opens up with a beautiful melody I mean gorgeous melody it's a track that is just contemplative and very moving and I like how the wonderous lead melody on this track slowly gets embellished more and more with some nice chords be some electronics kind of bubbling subtly in the background along with some acoustic drums it's a delicate song but the band takes a complete 180 on the next track seven-minute mind and does something completely hard riffing rigid a lot less fluid because this is a multi-phase track the band just all of a sudden changes shape groove and sound all over this track and right after that this long really liked that which I mean is not one of my favorites on this LP but still very good meanders a little bit at its beginning because of this kind of free improvisation moment that drags on just a little but still the band's chemistry their kinetic energy on this their performance keeps me on the edge of my seat and the suspense is certainly well worth it at the end of the track when the band busts into this kind of militaristic musical mood with with these kooky sin thorns kind of soaring over these drums that are just really tight and Stern the song wolf out presents even more riffs and works in a time signature so odd I would need to listen to this track a dozen more times to accurately count it out however I don't really feel the impulse to because the band plays in this odd groove so fluidly it almost makes me want to dance to it the tracks sing for a silver dollar and for my eyes we are kind of slow burners with chords that just work better at this pace very dramatic and Ethan hi verson plays his piano so well on these tracks he really shines with this piano not because he's soloing intensely but he's just playing so emotive ly benign but both tracks kind of had these thematic chords the beginning and end of the songs and in the middle have an experimental weird interlude kind of an obvious formula but still the interludes in the midst of these chords are pretty thought-provoking the first of which is kind of glitchy experimental electronic the second of the two is much more serene ambient the track I want to feel good part two though kind of throws a monkey wrench into the works a surprise if you will it's really one of the most traditionally sounding jazz songs on this entire LP I mean it's actually kind of hokey and just upbeat in its mood because of that and I think it is pretty smile inducing maybe not so much for me because you know I'm a depressed downer soul but the song throws yet another experimental interlude in the middle which does kind of make things a little refreshing and the band does make these happy happy chords sound a little stranger as the song progresses so they definitely experiment definitely do something that's you know oh you know they did that huh and one of the final tracks on this LP in stitches is a 14 minute long monster and the band totally justifies this length with one cohesive piece not a multi-phase song but one extremely focused track that actually starts very quiet and builds climactically toward its end and has maybe the most intense playing on this entire LP as it builds I mean just drums piano bass just freaking out man in terms of performance and songwriting this LP is there I mean it's definitely hard to just say oh it's jazz because there are spots that do feel like rock there are spots that do feel upbeat and poppy but if I did have to say there's something I kind of hold issue with on this album it is the sound though the drums and the bass and and and piano do come through very clearly they're very raw they're very bare skeletal all these extra elements that bad plus adds the mixture the drum machines the electronics the synthesizers for the most part they sound kind of tinny kind of flat I wish they had a bit more beef to them I wish they had a bit more volume to them and sure these things do help the bat plus make a different and new record for them but I would definitely be interested in hearing these sounds kind of if it brought up a little bit and rotated into the foreground because I think there's a ton of potential for the direction the bat plus is moving in on this LP not to say that that potential isn't realized in a sense on this album itself because I am feeling a light to decent 8 on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the bad + forever "},{"id":"S47nKJ8n0tk","title":"Uncommon Nasa - New York Telephone ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone banan thony WAMP tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new uncommon nasa record New York telephone uncommon NASA is a new york-based rapper producer label head and sound engineer this dude has a deep history was in the rap outfit the presence in the late 90s started uncommon records in the early 2000s was the pretty much go to sound engineer for definitive Jux records from 2000 to 2005 he has a number of collaborative albums under his belt with watu and Willie green as well as short fuse a number of solo records as well whether it be under an uncommon NASA or his other pseudonym Adam warlock however my personal first introduction to this guy's music was shortly after a fight I had with him over Twitter over the I think the last Raekwon album we did not see eye to eye and I had no clue who this guy was and you know we were just having a pretty heated and and lengthy discussion over whether or not this album was good or not that good it's so so as you can imagine coming fresh off this very impassioned argument impassioned on both sides maybe I was not totally in the perfect mindset I could have been in to listen to this man's music especially after seeing in a few different places online that he has categorized himself and his label as dabbling in progressive rap I did give uncommon asses last full-length LP a try it came out last year it's titled the land of the way it is I was impressed by the Prince Poe feature on this LP by a number of conceptual tracks on this project but I thought some of the rapping and some of the production was just a little too rough around the edges to get excited about it however I have come to learn that this is a very intentional characteristic and a characteristic that runs throughout this new uncommon NASA LP to NASA's vocals have a characteristically muddy feeling - either the way they recorded or mixed a feeling that doesn't really ring through on a lot of the guests versus here and the instrumentals on the self here absolutely cacophonous just really clunky bass lines heavy punchy just very muddy drums and samples that include screaming guitars subways sirens their shouts on this LP synthesizers scratching vinyl scratching this album is just pure underground grime plain and simple but is the style where the sound of these songs progressive not really in the sense that NASA is a flashy rapper at least he doesn't come off as one on this record he is no exhibit or Eminem or tec-9 or Busta Rhymes but NASA's material is progressive in the sense that it is different and sort of experimental rhythmically a lot of the beats on this LP are very loose they don't feel quantized they're not very tight just everything is very spaced out and just a little fluid and NASA's flow is pretty much the same way he seems to take away a lot from the rudimentary flows that a lot of rappers used to showcase in the 80s the early 90s sometimes he's on tempo sometimes he's off tempo he kind of borders between rapping and really expressive spoken word a lot of the time and he's rapping on top of these really oddly shaped instrumentals that have grooves in the background I don't think most rappers would even try to touch like the songs curmudgeon or destiny which had these really odd shuffling drum beats or the excitingly noisy instrumental on desperate times which I think there are very few emcees whose voices could really punch through everything that's going on in this beat this instrumental sounds like it was pulled together using the steam coming out of a sewer that was in the middle of the most crime-ridden Street in New York City in the early 90s there's the song 574 s which maybe has the most disorienting synthesizer line on the entire LP like weirder than a lot of stuff Death Grips has even done there are some very tight and steady beats on this LP - they have a very ARC edge to them like this bodega is trying to kill me or the title track on this record that kind of reminds me of old LP or old Def Jux or company flow records I think NASA takes away a lot from MF DOOM special herb series as well but just way weirder and more experimental there are a few sad and very dreary beats as well in the tracklist here there's a lot of variety across these instrumentals and even though they are sort of hard to get into at first because of how muddy they are they are very subtle they are very layered their blood pumping they're eerie they're creative and sometimes they're beautiful what is clearer than the sound quality of these instrumentals are the concepts or the stories behind these songs the song feedback loop is kind of a walk down memory lane with NASA directly referencing 9/11 in the hook of this song kind of marking that time as feeling long ago along with 1999 saying is this my memory or is this just my youth ending the song 574 is is another walk down memory lane but this one sort of orienting itself a little bit more around shoes specifically the 574 line of the New Balance brand and along with this shoe NASA dropped some inspirational lyrics and talks about things like working at a temp job which brought him to working at Wall Street at one point in time where he met mad jerks this bodega is trying to kill me is maybe one of my favorite tracks on this entire LP features a killer verse from a lucid of Armand Hammer and it's essentially a song kind of talking about this bodega filled with either seedy characters or bad omens and really unsanitary food there's paranoia or destruction which hit me as being kind of the one of the worst tracks on the LP at first merely because of how the hook is paranoia is always there just the way that it's sung it just feels very amateurish but the more I listen to this LP the more this hook really fit the aesthetic of the entire album and I do really love the lyrics and the sentiment of the song even though a lot of people paranoia seems to torture them and eat away at them and it seems to do that with uncommon - he sees it also as a plus something that continues to protect him deeper in his life and the song curmudgeon which has the saddest beat on the entire LP in my opinion kind of follows in that same kind of cranky loner vibe where NASA's talking about not wanting to meet a whole lot of new people or formerly strong relationships with really new people because instead he prefers to maintain the relationships he has with a lot of the people who he knows already he doesn't want to flood his life with people or just things that he feels are unnecessary he only wants to carry what are his essentials and then there's the title track to this LP another song I love and not really a track that has a story to it or anything but a lot of phone imagery a lot of phone folklore as well as one of the best hooks on the entire LP and this whole phone thing is an interesting concept that plays throughout this entire album as uncommon NASA presents this instrumental that samples a little bit of Frank Zappa off of the LP hot rats and over these instrumentals it seems like he's putting vocals snippets of people talking most of whom if not all seem to be related to this album in some way and they're all talking about why they love they left or they live in New York I think it's a nice segue from track to track it adds a lot of character to the album I think it pulls all the songs together and the entire record if you exclude the intro is bookended with these two songs which are maybe the most difficult to digest on the entire LP though I do think they do a great job of finishing things off with a really eerie feel or setting the tone with something kind of lofty and ambitious and very abstract you know uncommon NASA makes great hip-hop songs but there's something about tracks like destiny that is really difficult to classify and I really enjoy this track and I think it's a great start to the record even though it was a little off-putting at first but the more that I listen to it and the more that I appreciate it it seems like it's harder to put into words what it is about this track that makes it so great because the off kilter groove the Spacey flow the really esoteric meaning of a lot of what uncommon NASA is saying certainly makes it difficult to address some of the feature verses on this LP for a little bit I do think the songs that have more guest rappers on them tend to be a little less conceptual unfortunately I do think that is a little little bit of a hindrance though the guest verses are still good like with the stakes which features Billy woods you may know him from Armand Hammer and his solo stuff and BMS a rapper that I'm not really familiar with though his flow and his delivery reminds me quite a bit of guilty Simpson and then there is Curley Castro and Prem Rock / the song numb overall I think this is a great record one great track after another with an interesting theme and concept uncommon NASA writes of great hooks there's some very good guest features NASA picks and produces some wonderfully scuzzy beats and even though I don't think NASA is the most technically proficient or technically entertaining rapper he makes up for that a lot with his personality his subject matters his lyrics he's definitely one of those artists that when it comes to lyrics he's very much quality over quantity he is concept over catchiness there's some artists that can't really pull that dynamic off there's some artists who can and I think NASA is one who can I'm feeling a strong eight on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana uncommon NASA forever "},{"id":"7jxJ-R8w5ro","title":"The Flaming Lips - Oczy Mlody ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"and here we are proud of an Iraq and here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Flaming Lips album oxy Lobby legendary neo psych outfit The Flaming Lips are back with a new focused conceptual commercial album you know not some weird one-off project or an album where they ruin Pink Floyd songs or an album where they collaborate with every musician on the planet this thing is twelve tracks and 58 minutes of the band I guess with the exception of one track that features Miley Cyrus at the very end of the album and sonically it seems like the lips are kind of taking off from where they left off on the last full-length album the terror which was very much a spacey vast atmospheric and almost formless experience but what this album lacked in structure in meaty groovy beats and instrumentation it made up for in texture and some really strong dark moods and now it seems like the band is continuing this trippy and semi ambient aesthetic for another record and even though there's nothing on paper wrong with the band continuing this trippy and semi ambient aesthetic for another record I think with this project they end up with less results this time the songwriting doesn't really seem any more decisive than it was on the terror and when it does seem like the band is trying to write a track with the clear structure - or maybe a slight pop appeal to it the track we are our family case in point the song comes off almost silly as this cut sort of feels like a bit of a leftover headache from that last Miley Cyrus record that The Flaming Lips collaborated with her on a lot of the lyrics come off pretty subpar on this thing even by the band's absurdist standards the vocal and lead melodies are kind of redundant and the electronic sequence - everything on nearly every cut here leaves the album feeling really stiff and stagnant or even out of whack like on the song the castle where the hard trunk knockin kick drums don't even sound like they're apart of the same song that's just kind of quietly humming away in the background in a sea of reverb as it seems like everything but the kick drum is so soaked in reverb that the body of the sound is just sucked out of it and it's just kind of this Airy tinny ethereal trebly piece of tone that doesn't really have much body to it and while there's nothing in theory wrong with adding more synthetic percussion to an album adding more sequence percussion to your music if you are in fact a rock band The Flaming Lips don't really add enough subtleties to these beats to keep things interesting they're kind of happy to just copy and paste ideas until they just get tired sort of like the intro title track to this entire album which really wears its welcome before it's very short two minutes and 50 seconds even up a lot like with the Radiohead's King of Limbs this album doesn't so much feel like a band effort as much as it's almost like the the group's frontman splitting off from the band and creating some kind of solo electronic project on his desktop and then coming back and then just saying it's a band album now there are exceptions to this moments where it does seem like there is a significant amount of instrumentation added into the mix outside of those more synthetic elements moments where some string sections pop up and really elevate the mix and and give the music this eerie beauty like listening to the frogs with demon eyes or galaxies I sync two of my favorite tracks in the track listing here I also like the very meaty and kind of fuzzy distorted and funky bass and drum jam at the second half of mig dina it was a nice change of pace from yet another beat driven dreamy wave of tones the very cerebral and linear grooves on one night hunting for fairies and witches I believe that's titled the track the beats on this cut how they're kind of primal and weird almost reminds me of the last knife record oddly enough there are some highlights here and there on this record and overall I think this album has a cool aesthetic to it but on a bulk of the other tracks it seems like the band's usual quirk and in vivid sound play just gets washed out by this reverb heavy mix I appreciate the band trying to stick to the sound and really see it through but in my opinion they've kind of exhausted everything that they could possibly do with this they didn't really add anything to the sound other than some goofy Basie beats that could have easily been assembled in GarageBand it's kind of cool that they were able to make a lot of these tracks segue into one another though without a doubt this album is a kind of holistic experience you know it's not a mixed bag it's it's very much got a single uniform idea and the band executes sit for one song after another not a single track really stuck out to me as a sore thumb like it didn't really fit in to the track listing but most of the material here is plagued with textbook reverb abuse and some of the band's weakest writing to date I'm not really sure what to say about this record outside of that it just seems like there was a lot of potential kind of lost in this album unfortunately the lead singles were some of the worst that I've heard on a Flaming Lips album ever the band wanted to toy with more electronics and sequence beats and synthesizers but didn't really put in the effort to keep these electronic compositions enthralling and intriguing and a lot of the album just came off as drab to me unfortunately feeling a light to decent five on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit

REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new album more than any other day this is the debut full-length album from Montreal based post-punk art Punk outfit outfit on earlier this year they hit me with a few songs from this forthcoming record that got me scratching my chin not just because there's hair on it so I'm just it sounded like these guys were picking up a lot of cues from the vocals of guys like David Byrne of talking heads with this really eccentric erratic delivery and some pretty unusual lyrics to that center around some odd topics or everyday life or some hilarious statements take the title track of the song where the vocals tell the listener the title of the song and then say that the listener should open up the text books or a magazine whatever reading material they can get their hands on it's completely absurd it's ridiculous it's funny it's clever it's smart it's interesting it's off the beaten path that reminds me of my boys over here an MX 80 sound or like some of the mid-eighties slacker groups out there like camper van Beethoven I don't know and the same spoken-word eccentricity shows up as well on the song around again where we're getting some thought-provoking statements on the subject of god those are just the lyrics though musically it sounds like pulls from artists like cap and jazz or even Slynt a lot more the band occasionally writes songs like the track habit that are based off these very slow loosely played instrumental builds that get more intense as the band continues layering on keyboards and violin especially toward the back end of this track where the song gets very Velvet Underground s but the vocals on top of this musical moment are much more manic and there are other spots on here too where the band brings much more tightly grooved tracks with more nimble bass lines and very detailed drumbeats reminded me of bands like the feel ease or even mission of Burma you know that more artsy side of punk rock this happens on the song the weather song I love the head-bobbing groove on this track and I love the transition in this song from the verse to the chorus as the band brings in these punching keyboard chords and the way that the band plays through the track is interesting too it's like they're repeating the same parts over and over but as they get closer to the finish there they're just playing a little more intense a little louder just digging in a little harder I like that the recording on this record tries to maintain kind of a live-in-the-moment feel even if it is a little messy or a little too cacophonous at times with the drums and the guitars swallowing the vocals a little bit more than I would like them to and when things get loud the drums and the guitars clash a little awkwardly as well there are just moments where I think the recording could be better but for the most part it does sound enjoyably raw the band continues to deliver decent songs but even with these newer tracks the comparisons to other artists out there don't really stop at least in my head like the song forgiveness which is this wandering sort of directionless ballad that floats atop this bed of violin phrases that reminds me a little bit of Simon Joyner especially with how the vocals are just moaning really painfully and you know even though I know it's really hard for a modern band not to sound like at least someone in the past I guess the strong similarities to other artists that I'm hearing and just the plethora of different artists that it seems like awed may or may not listen to it can get a little distracting for me from time to time and I guess that's because I don't really find Ott's approach all that distinct though I do think they do their influences justice there are even moments on this LP like the opening track with the really bouncy sort of dreary guitar phrasing toward the back end of the song that really reminds me of women another great experimental sort of off-kilter lo-fi indie rock band from Canada again I think this band channels its influences really well for the most part I think they do them justice I think they write some good slow burners I think there are some moments here where they create a really nice ruckus and top it with some interesting lyrical ideas but is the ruckus always memorable there are some moments here where I think no but for the most part yes though I do think this is a relatively solid record there are some parts here where it feels like I'm trying to draw their instrumentation out which they do a lot on this LP the songs on here are not incredibly short or anything like that there are six or seven five minute tracks on this LP the two shorter songs on here just about four minutes so as the band is drawing out these instrumental moments on these longer songs they can lose steam here and there still I am feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana ought

Jim O'Rourke record simple songs Jim is a prolific multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter a jack of all musical trades and he's been at it for decades now with his most popular releases falling kind of under that alternative singer/songwriter tag and on the albums that are in that style Jim takes on a multitude of different musical influences you might hear just indie rock or low-five music or country rock maybe even some art pop folk and chamber pop jazz did I say jazz jazz jazz and jazz and then we have a lot of gems solo work his early stuff the steam room series the old news series records that dabble in noise drone ambient improvisational music of different types he has also been in numerous bands over the years or has appeared on the records of numerous bands over the years then he has countless collaborative albums with Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth and Matt's gustafson as well as MERS Bao and Orrin embark just dropped a record with him he's also worked with the experimental jazz and rock band fire jim has more collaborative records than some artists just have normal core studio records so despite all of the various projects all the experimentation over the years with various forms of rock and electronic music and experimental music and everything simple songs heads back into that singer/songwriter direction that people seem to to to to to gravitate toward the most but truth be told simple songs is not really that simple on this LP we get a series of slightly eccentric rock and pop tunes that are highly Baroque with one layer of strings after another very lush Arrangements all over this record there's some nice piano weaved in as well and these arrangements steal the show to the point where they kind of outshine Jim's vocals which a bit of a letdown I don't think Jim has done a singer-songwriter record thus far at least to my knowledge though I have not heard all of his records shocker who has but what I know of his singer-songwriter material thus far he's just sounding a little more emotionally detached vocally than usual still he does bring some clever and decent lyrics from what I can make out of them on tracks like friends with benefits and half life crisis and a few of the songs toward the back end here where his vocals step out just a little bit more but for the most part his vocals lack so much presence that I just find my mind kind of just gravitating toward the instrumentals which actually aren't that bad I really like nearly every instrumental here like with the opening cut where we get the incredibly dramatic ascending guitar lead and strings that have finished the song out and the very nice country rock riffs that start the song off just feel really rootsy and fun and really captivating then with the song that weekend we are getting some baroque pop with some whispered vocals some just very lightly tempo keeping strings it's very dramatic Jim knows how to compose songs to elicit emotional reactions and on the song half life crisis we get a little 70s pop rock a little bit of 70s piano rock like in the vein of Tom Rundgren or Elton John I love the harmonized guitar leads on this track and later as the song progresses we get these almost orchestral layers of strings naissance however as the instrumentation piles on Jim's vocals get even more lost to the point where I'm just kind of wondering why even record a vocal to begin with on the more instrumentally stripped back tracks this isn't really that much of an issue but when Jim is kind of competing with his own instrumentation when he's singing I don't know I just can't help but feel like I'm not getting everything I could out of this record because a core element of his songwriting is just barely audible the vocals step out into the spotlight a little bit more like on the acoustic cut these hands or on last year which feels like a little bit of classic rock and it's it's at this point on the record that I guess this album fits the simple songs bill only in that it's not so abstract and experimental like many of Jim's other albums because while the very complicated instrumental arrangements all over the cell Pere pretty cool and just very much ear candy I just can't help but feel like there are again core elements of Jim's songwriting that are kind of neglected in the face of just kind of showing his talents for arranging and while the string arrangements aren't bad I mean they are key to especially how the back end of this record works I mean the very end of this album features some incredible building strength sections which give this album a powerful finish the track previous to that is one of the softer in the track listing here but is incredibly lush because of these arrangements just very pretty on the ears but I still can't help but feel like just an element of this recipe is kind of missing these bold and creative arrangements I think should also be complemented with a bold and creative and memorable lead vocal but really they're not and it's not like Jim's vocals are mixed low and kind of muffled or mumbled and an experimental or eccentric sense a lot of the time it just kind of feels like he's a just a little out to lunch so this thing was by no means a terrible record and I think hardcore fans will be excited to know that he's kind of returned to the sound even if it's just for for 37 minutes outside of the fact that it's been awhile since Jim has done a record like this I'm just not really seeing anything else to be excited over with this album because as I'm experiencing it musically just not much is sticking with me aside from the very finely tuned and well put-together instrumentals that is it just kind of feels like on the vocal end of things got kind of burned I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music review forever "},{"id":"x7lQBFEURZY","title":"Sons of Kemet - Your Queen Is a Reptile ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone zip the knees OOP tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sons of Kemet album your queen is a reptile this is the third full-length commercial album from the london-based jazz outfit an album that I would love to see go down as one of the more exhilarating jazz records of 2018 it's one of those albums that works in layers and a record that the band clearly tried to conceptualize in multiple ways from the focus on different female figures throughout black history tributed in name and the tracklist each of which seems to be an answer to the title of the album my queen is this person your queen is a reptile witch right from the get-go on this album seems like a kind of aggressive and radical shot at the monarchy and then we have the passion to spoken-word passages that run throughout the intro and outros of this record both of which feature poet Josh a day in the track my queen is a to Eastman in this track he goes into his background as an immigrant he's telling off the Tories he's giving all of these frustrated revolutionary aggressive proclamations his performance on the track my queen is Dorian Lawrence's just as explosive at some points and features a lot of rhetoric about getting the UK back on track and calling out racism going further into the record then there is the band's very interesting instrumental setup which at its core is two drummers tuba and saxophone which on paper might not seem like much you have four players and half of them are percussion but this record is filled with uniquely groovy and deeply rhythmic sounds right down to the horn playing which a lot of the time isn't very smooth for much of this record the sax and tuba kind of lock into these staccato phrasings where they just continually blurt and squawk out these hot blasts of brass occasionally pulling out these really quick speedy hooky melodies and riffs that become more and more hypnotic as the band jams on them there's such a communal momentum and just vibe to the performances on this record and and given just how many Polly rhythms are worked into the instrumentation this could just be my American biases coming in here but there's something about it that feels a lot like an old school old school New Orleans Jazz Band again could be where I'm from kind of pouring through could just be the way that the drums sound against the tuba as many contemporary jazz bands don't even bother to try to coorporate tuba into their sound the Tambor their instrumentation gives sons a feel that comes off just generations old but their compositional their performance style is wild it's crazy it's contemporary of course there are stylistic parallels between this record and African music Caribbean music as well as the track my queen is Phipps Clarke sees the band working through this psychedelic fusion of dancehall and like double reggae with very springy echoes on the vocals which of course are delivered by Congo natty who is one of many collaborators that pop up on this record here and there just to add maybe a little bit of extra horn in the background or something but really the core and the excitement of this album doesn't come necessarily straight from the guests but again just the core of the band and the jams that they embark on on this record every single one of them that is up-tempo is really electrifying and again more dynamic than one might assume given just drums tuba and sax the rhythms are typically what managed to change shape and evolve and grow and shrink in size across a lot of these tracks meanwhile the sax and tuba harmonize they reinforce and they bounce off of each other really well and the chemistry that sons have on this record is so good that it's hard to tell when they're just kind of jamming just kind of riffing just kind of going off or they've transitioned into a spot that is a little bit more composed or just with more preconception like the authoritative and beautiful sax leads that open up the closing track to this thing which were clearly written or the bouncy heavy deep subterranean tuba lines on FIPS Clarke I guess what I'm trying to say is whether it's improvised or whether it's written there's always a strong sense of direction and a lot of muscle to the playing and when the band does manage to go off on a jam it's just so easy to get lost in their doing which is you you know you know it's some good improv when you just kind of get a little overwhelmed by it and it just kind of short your circuits especially when there's just really strong rhythmic backing on these tracks like on the song my queen is harriet tubman i love the drums on this track there's just so much propulsion the horns all over this track are just darting left and right really intensely and this is one of the moments on the album where I feel like the music really has a very clear and direct connection to the person is trying to tribute I mean given Harriet Tubman's story and everything she needed to do to free slaves the fact that there is I guess a kind of speed an urgency to the horns on this track only makes sense the song nanny of the Maroons as well given the time frame of her life as well as her Jamaican heritage the the primordial feel the rhythms on this track just feel centuries-old there's a beautiful old mellow simplicity specifically to this track that just isn't anywhere else and it seems like an effort not only to tribute her historical figure but also maybe to create something that she might have even listened to or had enjoyed right I know I know historically that's a little bit of a stretch but still I don't know that that's just the vibe I got off this track I also love the subtle intro and the progressively blossoming Jam on the track my queen is Julia Cooper it's one of the softest songs on the entire record and yet also one of the grooviest I also love in the second half how the band sort of becomes scattered at one point it's like the instrumentation just isn't matching up but very intentionally and then all of a sudden they just reform and just come back together quickly locking on to the tempo once again there's also really amazing and explosive transition in the second half of the track my queen is Angela Davis where the tempo rhythm really everything picks up and god it's just such a night-and-day difference from this originally very smooth introduction which of course was beautiful gorgeous and then all of a sudden the the tuba starts Bupa doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and just it's just off to the races you know the band doesn't really come at these tracks any one way if I have any nitpick on the record overall the more subtle moments I think could have used a bit more finesse tour could have been a bit more melodic I get some of the more aggressive spots being as rudimentary harmoniously as they are because you know you're kind of you're kind of swapping some of that that melody that harmony out for the rhythm the drive the push the explosivity and while the more mellow moments on this record are nice breathers and for the most part they're not skippable they're not terrible but the structure of these tracks doesn't seem nearly as clear or as well assembled as that of some of the more aggressive cuts that and I found the inclusion of vocals on the record to be a little odd only for several of the cuts on the album to to feature them not that I think it needed to be on the entire album but to have two of those three vocal cuts kick the entire album off it almost sets an expectation for the rest of the LP that just doesn't follow through outside of that though this is a really great LP super enjoyable great recording great performances good writing interesting instrumental combination great chemistry interesting concept and there's certainly something radical and revolutionary and bold about the message of this record as well that I respect I'm feeling a strong a to a late night on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please

"},{"id":"FihAfj0FALk","title":"Coldplay - Ghost Stories ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and right here ghost stories is the sixth full-length LP from famed pop rock alternative rock outfit Coldplay in the independent music gangs that that I run with Coldplay tends to get a lot of hate and on numerous occasions I have come to their defense in the case of Records like X&Y and Viva la Vida I happen to think these LPS have some very good songs on them and some very illustrious beautiful production but for a rock band Coldplay has very little in the way of grit urgency which is something I usually like in my rock music but if at least you can write something that's beautiful or just genuinely gorgeous and moving I could vibe with it but I don't really think Coldplay's tendency to do that has translated onto their two latest records even though I do think these new albums do sit in unique positions for Coldplay stylistically their last full length LP Mahal was easily their most poppy and sugary release to date whereas ghost stories to me is their dreamiest their sleepiest their most low-key album I also think this LP is where Coldplay is sounding the most like some of their most obvious influences like Radiohead and sigur r√≥s take the opening moments on the song magic which has this very simple kick drum snare pattern with a guitar rhythm guitar playing in three over this 4/4 beat totally sounds like something Thom Yorke would just come soaring in on with his little falsetto I think Coldplay has been on kind of a Radiohead kick lately especially considering that the track atlas that they landed on the new Hunger Games soundtrack also sounded kind of Radiohead inspired I would actually even go as far as to say the song midnight off of this LP sounds a little bit like one of the closing tracks on the new boney vert record a track that sees these really eerie ice-cold lead vocals singing with an odd off-putting chorus effect throughout the song over very ethereal soft instrumentation the track eventually builds into a very subtle 4/4 kick drum it is nose prai's that this song has some production on it from John Hopkins a great electronic music producer from the UK who has collaborated with Coldplay on a few occasions he has a stellar record titled immunity that you should definitely check out but this collaboration with John Hopkins and this driving 4/4 rhythm is just an ominous sign of what's to come later on this LP when Coldplay collaborates with none other than Avicii on one of the final tracks of this album and it's a song that unfortunately I don't think Coldplay really comes out the victor it feels like they just bring on Avicii in order to facilitate in order to embrace all of these incredibly cliche EDM formulas and it just ends up feeling like a really obvious attempt at hopping on a trend Coldplay even simplifies and dumbs down their lyrics to the lowest level on this track in order just to make them fit into the preconceived EDM blueprint there are actually quite a few moments on this LP though where I really enjoy the guitar or the vocal melody like off the track magic hey mad G and then there's the song true love and I can't really put my finger on it either it's the vocal melody or it's the chord progression totally reminds me of one of the softer more psychedelic Beatles tracks off of their late era stuff like White Album or Abbey Road but instead the song is delivered with more serene epic instrumentation really lavish strings so I do really like some of the tunes that are the foundation to these tracks but instrumentally sonically so many of these songs are absolutely sterile kind of lifeless especially with the big embrace of electronic beats on this record which I mean I'm totally fine with electronic music if you go down the road of finding and crafting some interesting sounds but so many of the rhythms on this thing or just bland and uninteresting especially the ones like on the track Inc which I am pretty sure Timbaland must have had a hand in it sounds like a rhythm he was about to use for something else that it just landed on this Coldplay track but again the sterility of the sounds on this record it feels like every member of Coldplay had their instruments locked into this bacteria-free laboratory and they were just wiped down and cleaned and then in order to play and perform on this record every member had to go through a decontamination chamber get gassed go into the room all the people behind the board's wearing hazmat suits to make sure not a single germ made it onto the record I like that the whole LP feels like a really holistic experience with one track just slipping softly into another this album to me feels like Coldplay really paid attention to the flow of this thing much more than they did on their last record however I also think maybe these tracks are blending together so well because the entire album is slightly uneventful they're just some moments on this LP they're just straight you've gotta see it I don't wanna just say what you feel they're just straight boring even the songs that I like feel that way to a slight very slight degree and instrumentally there are songs on here that just make me cringe like the track ink it lyrically is this song about a metaphor having to do with the pain of loving someone but also getting a tattoo possibly maybe getting a tattoo of someone's name or a tattoo for someone please educate me but whenever I was reading into the lyrics of these songs I wasn't really enjoying them especially this one finishing line where Chris Martin is saying hey I wish you were here I wish we were with each other watching TV I don't know if the lyrics on this record are in tribute to some kind of major personal loss they most definitely could be and and if they are they reflect these pains and these life events in the most mundane of ways to me this LP is just bland overly tenderized adult contemporary pop ballads with a new-age twist and and that's about it I'm feeling a decent of strong for on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Coldplay ghost stories forever

ALBUM REVIEW ft. Cal Chuchesta","y":8,"x":"still love me too hi everyone Casey and Jo Jo Jo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jeff Rosenstock album we cool no we not cool cuz you're ripping me off you're campion me buddy how am i copying you you got my hair you got my skin you got my face you're just ripping me off well how can I be a copy of you when you're just a figment of my imagination oh my god I was just making him up the whole time how they found it tore tilith yo give me a piece no get your own Jeff Rossen sock is a singer-songwriter once singer and guitarist for the band Baum the music industry the punk band formed in the mid-2000s disbanded last year personally I never really got that deep into them they're bright uppity melodic poppy approach to Punk never really sat that well with me but I did find there occasionally downtrodden and snarky lyrics pretty admirable and coming off that bomb the music industry demise Jeff is just sort of going back into a solo direction because it's been a little while since he released music and some of his other side projects and while he has gone solo once before with the record I look like shit I think he's really doing it on another level on this new release here but aside from pop punk on this record you can also expect whiffs of indie rock and Weezer s power pop some alt-country some folk music there's definitely some undertones of Andrew Jackson jihad on this album like knife man era Andrew Jackson jihad as some of you may know that band actually made their side one dummy debut not too long ago but I didn't care for that record all that much because I think Andrew Jackson's rough around the edges quirks were part of what made that band so interesting whereas on the flip side with bond the music industry as well as Jeff Rosenstock solo stuff I've always thought maybe they were just too for my taste maybe they needed to be cleaned up a little bit primped and synced up up up up and we cool does in fact feature a cleaner brighter punchier recording than jeff solo stuff and most bond the music industry releases in my opinion the drums the guitars are all tightly assembled on this album and complemented very well with some sense and some glockenspiel and some piano and some brass even though you're getting that throttling punk energy you may be getting layers of instrumentation riding along that same tempo just making the song not only sound exciting and just blood pumping but epic and atop all of this our Jeff Rosen stocks very lively vocals and some pretty sharp lyrics too even though Jeff on this album is deep into his 30s on much of this record he is reflecting on emotions I think most people have in their 20s when they find themselves at a crossroads where they just don't know what to do with their lives is Jeff going back into the past and remembering these feelings or is he having these feelings now because of the demise of bond the music industry and he's not really sure where his own music career is going there are certainly some present-day reflections found on this record like with the introductory track where it seems that Jeff is talking about friends of his or just people that he knows getting established buying homes having families meanwhile he doesn't have to get up he doesn't have a kid or he's just kind of bumming around and this is something that I think gives him freedom and gives him excitement and leads him on all sorts of adventures that he enjoys but he finds like depression in this too especially with tracks like nausea which is a really clumsily played piano rock track but it's still very awesome it's a endearingly clumsy and on this track we see Jeff avoiding loved ones and avoiding family conversations with these people and diving instead into alcohol because he's sick and tired of talking about and thinking about what he's going to do with his life these very sad feelings are amplified on the next track beers alone again which is a bit of all country or on the song polar bear or Africa where Jeff has this really killer refrain on this track where he says that I'm going to die and you're going to forget my name which i think is also reflected in the song Hall of Fame too this is a pretty morbid album overall Jeff may see some lows on this record he may see some successful highs but he doesn't even seem to enjoy those because he sort of sees death as this great equalizer that knocks all of us down but these sentiments are balanced out with incredibly energetic guitars and epic choruses and righteous guitar solos many of the tracks on this album are super anthemic and if you were to strip the lyrics out of the equation you could even call the music upbeat and a lot of the songs flow into one another really well I don't think Jeff was trying to write a story or outright create a concept album but it certainly feels like that with how seamless some of the music is from track to track and given that Jeff centers around a lot of the same emotions and in lyrical themes on this 30-minute record Jeff is not in his 50s right now but still this album kind of feels like a midlife crisis record if the life expectancy today was 60 with a lot of personality and emotion conviction humor Jeff tackles reflections on death and expectations ambitions the game of life there are a few lulls in the tracklisting here like with the song novelty sweater which sounds just pulled straight out of the Weezer playbook not really seeing what Jeff is doing for this sound other than just kind of copying it for this track here even though the tune is okay and the song all blissed out to which sees Jeff and his acoustic guitar sort of drenched and reverb thrown in the distance and it's just difficult to connect with the song right up until the very end where the instrumentation just explodes I think the only major issue that some people might have with this record is that Jeff's vocals are a little off-kilter yell P not for everybody and he's working with a pretty straightforward pop punk sound which isn't anything entirely new it's a stage we're all very familiar with but on top of this stage I think Jeff gives a very smart elaborate performance for me this record is a fun catchy but also comprehensive take on those formative but also embarrassing moments in our lives where we just don't know what direction to move in so instead some of us refuse to do anything or just refuse to grow up this record hits quick but it says a lot and musically I think it's really dense too I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given the album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it what should Anthony review next what am i doing

everyone. Fresh Orange here, The Internet's Busiest Music Nerd‚Ñ¢... and it's time for a review of the new Eminem album, Revival. Wow. Wow! This album is bad, it's... It's really bad. Like, I don't wanna waste your time. I don't wa- I don't wanna waste any more of my time... It i- It is bad. I feel like this record has already sucked away enough of my life force, so let's not beat around the bush. Legendary Detroit rapper comes back, and releases a sequel to some of his most disliked albums, Relapse and Recovery. In a way, this album is kinda like a meditation on his waning relevance, or at least, that's how he sets the tone on the opening track here featuring Beyonc√©. He pens kinda, like, a lyrical odyssey on his fall from grace. The bare piano instrumental in the background was a nice touch, Beyonce's hook on the track is very pretty... I find Eminem's story and introspective lyricism on the track pretty compelling, despite this weird, erratic angry staccato flow that he seems to be locked into lately. He sounds like, uh, a malfunctioning tone-deaf robot who's, like, finding out what feelings are for the first time. So, he writes this huge emotional track about his fame, his feelings on his fame, his alleged perfectionism And then, immediately after this, he spends the rest of the album delivering to us 18 cuts that, uh, pretty much exemplify why he's not taken as seriously as he used to be. To kinda take it track by track, we have the barely tolerable \"I Believe\" and \"Chloraseptic.\" The former of the two there is kind of an extension of the opening track, but a bit more aggressive.\nBoth songs feature these very subtle, kind of muddy trap beats. Phresher, who's featured on the song \"Chloraseptic,\" is the album's lone rapper featured, but he doesn't actually rap. He just handles the hook. You hear him occasionally on there, but then he just kinda disappears and falls into the background as Eminem's delivering these triplet flows on the chorus. It's kind of just, like, a really weird mix. It's one of many weird mixes across this entire album. Like, how he has sold millions and millions of records and his songs are mixed like garbage, I don't know. After this, we have the song, \"Untouchable,\" which could essentially be the centerpiece to a \"Hamilton\"-style rap musical inspired by white guilt. I get the sentiment behind the track. I get what Eminem is trying to communicate on the song, but I feel like his approach is just so grossly preachy and reductive. Not to mention, his yelpy vocals and the instrumental are absolutely hideous and annoying. Way to go ruining a completely good Cheech and Chong song. Eminem is right in this song, though, because sometimes it can be really embarrassing to be white. This moment is certainly one of them. [Eminem, \"Foolish Pride\"]\n‚ô™ Blacks and whites sometimes mix ‚ô™ ‚ô™ But black girls only want your money cos they're dumb chicks ‚ô™ ‚ô™ So imma say it like this: ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss. ‚ô™ The song \"River\" featuring Ed Sheeran is, of course, a terrible, melodramatic rap ballad, the worst bar on this track being: \"Actually just shit on my last chick / And she has what my ex lacks.\" Ex lacks? Get it? Ex-Lax? Musically, the song just sounds really clich√©, really trite, overly dramatic... The lyrics are all about being in a relationship built on lies and taking advantage of one another. It's pretty unlikable. N-no reason to listen to this track ever again. The song \"Remind Me\" ruins another perfectly good song: Joan Jett's \"I Love Rock n' Roll.\" It's this really garish, ugly rap-rock fusion, with the worst bar on it being, \"Your booty is heavy-duty... *sigh* like diarrhea.\" Yeah, it's just stomach churning. It's sickening. I can't stand it. The song \"Like Home\" is this anti-Trump anthem that is trying way too hard, *way too hard* to be meaningful, anthemic, and inspiring. Like, I wish that Eminem had just recorded an acapella of his BET freestyle and just put it on here. Some of the bars on this thing are, like, so corny in comparison to his performance there. The overblown kick drums and the glossy MIDI pianos in the mix do not help. The worst bar on this track has to be: \"Cos this type of pickle we're in's hard to deal.\" As- as in- as in-*cough* As in, like, d-deal. Like \"dill,\" like \"dill pickle.\" Also, on this track, he rhymes \"Nazi\" with \"not see,\" and \"General Lee\" with \"generally.\" On the song \"Bad Husband,\" I don't know what's worse. Is it the instrumental and the X Ambassadors' hook?\nTh-the weird sputtering electronics in the beat? Or is it Eminem's lyrics about, \"How can I be such a garbage, abusive spouse but such an amazing dad???\" Which, I mean, I get it. Some people are terrible at some things and good at other things. It's not really rocket science. It just seems like a really weird, kinda, humblebrag. Y'know, now that I think about it, it's definitely the X Ambassadors' hook. Tha-that's grosser. Tha-that's the grossest part, even with Eminem's final verse on the track trying its best to evenly distribute the blame across both parties... *cough cough* really desperately. The song \"Tragic Endings\" literally sounds like a demo. The mix sounds like crap.\nIt sounds like a demo song.\nWhy is it on this album? I think this song just goes to show that all the money in the world cannot buy good taste. It apparently cannot buy good production, either. The song \"Framed\" is actually one of the better sounding tracks on the record. Lyrically, it's a pretty funny song. Eminem comes through with this zany, very expressive flow. Kind of feels like old Eminem. There's a bit of a serial killer vibe coming through in the lyrics, too. It's kind of fun, however, I think Em sort of botches the hook on this thing like he did his marriage. \"I was fraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamed.\" \"He got nothing to do with meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.\" We have more excruciating melodrama on the song \"Nowhere Fast.\" It's pretty much your typical Eminem \"tugging-at-your-heartstrings\" affair, but with Kehlani on the hook. Ehh... There's really nothing special about the track outside of Eminem's vocal passages at the 3:20 mark, which is some of the worst vocal layering I've heard all year. It sounds like Eminem trying to harmonize with MIDI strings and a tone-deaf robot. [Eminem, \"Nowhere Fast\"]\n‚ô™ Who knows what the future for us could hold? ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Another shooter? Uh-oh ‚ô™ The song \"Heat\" is this really stomach-churning country-rap. It sounds like Eminem took every terrible quality of a Yelawolf song and tried to condense them down into one song. The hook kind of makes me laugh, maybe not in a way that Eminem intended, but that's, uh, I guess that's an upside. And there are numerous contenders on this thing for the worst bar: \"Girl, you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the backburner / You got buns, ùêº ùí¢ùí™ùíØ ùíúùíÆùí´ùê∏ùëÖùí¢ùê∏ùëÖùíÆ.\" \"I just bodied the beat, so that whole must have been dug / cuz it just died like food coloring, duh!\" \"So let's get turnt like a shish kebab / Twist it, ma, like an air conditioning knob.\" *KOFF* On the song \"Offended,\" I am offended, but maybe not in the way that Eminem intended me to be offended. Because there's nothing really all that edgy about the song, you know? It's just kind of childish, that's all. And there are actually some decent bars on this thing. I like that line about \"[not being able to] catch a body if somebody fainted,\" or that other line saying that his competition can't see him because he doesn't own a mirror(!) which, I think, inadvertently, is kinda a statement about Eminem digging himself so far down into a hole of mediocrity that he's literally lost all touch with the outside world and and he's the only person who he-who he can talk to. No really, I mean, with this track, I'm just kind of offended that I wasn't offended that much. The most annoying thing about the cut is, uh, the moment where Eminem breaks it down into, like, a playground rhyme, where he says everybody is gonna eat his turds. For the most part, this is just zany, off-the-wall Eminem, y'know? You have lines about Bill Cosby, uh, facializing an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal There are moments in the song I think are kind of funny,  and pretty entertaining, but it does not make up for every awful track I've had to sit through thus far! The song \"Need Me,\" featuring P!nk, is-is really like a P!nk song featuring Eminem. She takes up a bulk of the track, which, maybe, is a saving grace if you like P!nk and you don't want to hear so much Eminem anymore on this album. The song \"In Your Head\" completely ruins a wonderful Cranberries song. It's one of my favorite Cranberries songs. It's one of the best songs of the 90s. [In Your Head] totally wrecks it.\nWhat is with this album and the lazy sampling?\n(Spoiler alert: Rick Rubin.) Most of the time it just sounds like when there is a sample on the album, Eminem is just rapping over a badly mixed and muddy cut of the song itself, and Just leaving it like that with some extra drums pumped in just to give it some punch. I mean, for the majority of the song \"Arose,\" Eminem is just rapping over, like, this very faint sound of somebody singing, uh, the LeAnn Rimes song \"Some Say Love.\" Maybe it's a sample of the original track. I couldn't quite tell. It was super quiet, and something about the the sound of the vocal sounded a little off and weird. The song \"Castle\" is one of the few tracks on the record I legitimately enjoy. The female singer on the track is quite nice.\nHer vocal melody is very eerie and alluring. The instrumental is decent too. Eminem is rapping, from a very heartfelt place, about his daughter about to be born. There's this really strong sense of emotion and nostalgia and time passing on this cut. There are moments where the storytelling and the narrative power of the track, like, almost approaches, like, \"Stan\"-levels of amazing. There's a moment where the tone of the track almost starts to take that of a letter. Eminem takes some pills, and then it's like he's dead, essentially. Which brings us into the next track, the final track, \"Arose,\" Where Eminem pulls off a pretty heart-wrenching performance where it seems like he scares himself into having to say all these things to his family and his loved ones that he wishes he would be able to if he did, in fact, die. It's a pretty moving moment, although he does occasionally sabotage it with some very corny puns. Eminem is on his deathbed on this track, and he's still writing bars like there's a bunch of dudes in the emergency room going \"Oh. Oh. Woah. Aah.\" So, there's a point in the track when he sort of rewinds, and sort of goes back in time to where he doesn't take those pills, doesn't put himself on his deathbed, the beat of the previous track reintroduces itself, and he ends the album flushing the pills down the toilet. Which is actually kind of fitting for this album: to end with the sound of a toilet flushing. Yeah, this, this thing is awful. Light 2. Tran- sition! Have you given this album a listen? Did you love it? Did you hate it? Did you love it, or did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're the best, you're the best.\nWhat should I review next?\n(spoiler alert: Street Gang Imagery.)

ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone finally here Tanner here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new Kendrick Lamar album damn Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar's back with his fourth studio full-length album I guess that is if you don't count his a b-sides record that dropped last year untitled unmastered essentially a set of raw b-sides and afterthoughts following his incomparable 2015 album to pimp a butterfly an album that was so great even the leftovers from this album sounded amazing lately Kendrick has been on fire everybody knows it he is just on a level that none of his contemporaries are on right now in terms of achieving both incredible commercial success and artistic success his albums do numbers but he still manages to be lyrical conceptual and on the cutting edge of modern music and just like he said on that teaser freestyle the heart part 4 he came through the classic he dropped that and he came right back with another one so his consistency is impeccable and on that very same line Kendrick gives us the Kendrick Lamar guarantee that the next album is going to be great it's going to have the whole industry on an icepack it's a bold claim but Kendrick has given us no reason thus far to doubt him so damn is here and Kendrick once again has hit us with an artistic left hook because this record is far from being the grand jazz-influenced meditation on self-worth that to pimp a butterfly was this album brings an entirely different sound and on top of that while it is conceptual I think Kendrick approaches concept in a really fractured way totally unlike what anybody has heard on good kid maad city or to come a butterfly where you might have multiple ideas but they all kind of coalesce to one point before I get too deep into Dan let me just say I'm pretty floored by the fact that Kendrick with each project has reinvented himself almost entirely from top to bottom and in this case in a really short amount of time now in comparison with everything Kendrick has released thus far damn is his most scattered album even though it may not be as dense or as somatic as good kid maad city or to pimp a butterfly it's harder to compartmentalize because there's so much going on this is Kendricks most raw and intense album emotionally whether that be tracks that have an incredible amount of aggression and grit or just really pain sorrow and depression now what is guiding this change of pace it may have a lot to do with the Fox News clip that he plays toward the beginning of the album where his art his B et performance specifically I believe was misconstrued as being bad for black culture bad for black people bad for race relations in America and this clip that he plays is not the only time in the mainstream media that Kendricks art has been interpreted in this way now Kendrick has taken this slander against his art personally obviously but I think he's also taken it as a challenge on this album to basically say hey you know you you want the angry hedonistic violent rap guy I'll give them to you I'll be that guy I'll hop on a track banger I'll get in other rappers faces I'll play that role I'll get nasty like that all play dirty and the way he goes about embodying this on this record I think is really creative not just with the heightened aggression of this album not just with his interesting approaches between him and his producers to contemporary flows and production styles but they're actually quite a few moments on this record where you get like these reverb DJ drops on the record that's just like a new kungfu cutting hmm like I'm listening to some mixtape that I downloaded off adapt it but the decision to go into this direction runs even deeper than this as Kendrick uses this as an opportunity to comment on hip-hop culture at large and race relations in a post Obama America and I would say there's one more major layer to this album which is addressed on a couple of tracks here but it's not something that is spoken about throughout the entire record and that's that I genuinely think Kendrick is depressed on this album seriously I don't think we've ever heard Kendrick on a record consistently sounding so unhappy so unsure themself sounding this vulnerable I mean even on the darkest moments of good kid maad city and on to pimp a butterfly it still felt like we were listening to an artist who knew where he was going that everything he was doing was being orchestrated as some part of grand plan a lot like the God he's been so sure is looking out for him on his previous project but I'm damn Kendrick is shaken not just in regards to his faith but I think his moral compass as well and those two things are really important pivotal things to a Kendrick Lamar project those things usually play pretty central roles when it comes to keeping his mind right and with those two things deteriorating on this record Kendricks message sounds way more unresolved and conflicted than I thought it would be going into this record it may also have to do with the fact that he's taking on such huge concepts stated in bold capitalized lettering in the titles of these tracks pride lust fear God etc these are things that philosophers have been mulling over for thousands and thousands of years I don't expect all of their intricacies to be explained in a 55-minute rap album but damn isn't so much about the answer to anything as much as it is about the struggle to understand something that's especially intense and difficult for Kendrick because his savior complex drives him to have that answer it drives him to have that solution it also feeds a loneliness in him on the song feel where he sort of portrays himself as the savior as the hero as the provider but nobody is saving or providing for him nobody's praying for him and even though he may have legions of fans who are certainly concerned with his well-being and his mental state when you put yourself in that position you still can't help but feel that way occasionally and again faith also drives the struggle of this album because on numerous occasions Kendrick has said that he does what he does with his music as some kind of service to God but then he's left with no solid conclusions or answers when he feels like he's been left behind by this God to suffer and to struggle which he takes us some kind of sign from God comparing himself to Jobe which happens on the song fear which if you're unfamiliar with it it's basically a biblical story about a man Jobe who essentially tears his life apart as a test of his faith in his love it's on the same track where I think Kendricks faith his belief in God takes the ugliest turn that it has on any project that he's released so far right at the very end of the song fear where we hear a voicemail from his cousin Carl which he alludes to on the song yah and if you look at this voicemail it's pretty interesting referencing Deuteronomy Carl makes the case that Kendrick is unhappy he's struggling he's unsure of things because he's kind of drifted away from God's light he's not living up to the commandments the statutes the laws set by God pretty much the the Christian God he then makes the case that black people Hispanic people and Native American people are the true children of Israel which seems harmless on its face that's fine but then that is channeled into every injustice over the course of history being interpreted as a punishment by God because these groups of people have drifted away from the Word of God and this is pretty much presented without comment I don't see Kendrick criticizing this idea it's just kind of thrown out there again on the song yeah where Kendrick references this call references this voicemail I've been from a few things he says about it I'm led to believe that he thinks that there's at least some truth to it now let me just say before I go much further i all right disagree with this on every level I personally feel it's bullshit and stupid to chalk up mass genocide slavery Jim Crow the mexican-american war and countless other things to some kind of divine punishment the roots of these and justices are political their social their economic to blame it all on God's will just kind of seems disgusting to me bordering on self-hatred and most definitely self flagellation and in my opinion the exact opposite of being conscious now my ideological disagreement he didn't really factor into my overall feelings with the album especially since this voicemail does happen to land on what I felt was one of the better tracks on the record but I do think moments like this should not be overlooked by the listener in fact they should be at the forefront of the listeners mind while they listen to this album because this idea of God punishing Kendrick for not living up to the moral code that he should is part of the reason he's suffering on this record this is the mentality that he's beating himself up with on this record when you see him going into those dark places he's rationalizing his own pain and suffering as being the decision of some Supreme Being that he's never seen and all he can do is just throw himself at God's mercy and say please don't do this please don't take all my success and everything away for me personally walking around with that mentality that view of the world I would go crazy it would be like walking on hot coals for the rest of my life or going into a fucking wood chipper feet first now I would say those are the major themes of the album there other abstract sort of ideas that are placed throughout the record - most notably the symbolism of the blind woman in Kendricks death at the very start of the album also the serendipitous series of events that could have led to Kendrick not even being born on the closing track Duckworth obviously there were intentions to placing these things in the album like the vocal passages that are reversed at a few points in the album which you could put in an audio editor place in the right way see what Kendrick is saying there and get a deeper meaning out of the track potentially but I took a lot of these moments as just being kind of open to interpretation for the listener and maybe you could even take this album on the hole as that because it seems like Kendrick is intentionally trying not to do what he's done in the past and that is beat the listener over the head with some kind of central theme concept or idea now that's me trying to wrap up the general idea of an almost bipolar album things get even more interesting on this record when you dive into each track individually on the song DNA while this is a very aggressive banger and is a track that is solely exciting just on its sound in Kendricks awesome vocal performance here it's also a track where we seek hendrik struggling to kind of make sense of all these things that he sees as pretty much being a part of his genetic code that could be anything good positive or amazing like being royalty to something really negative and dark and awful to like being poison on the song element Kendrick celebrates his unapologetic dominance of the rap game also his connections to criminals on a bar or to this is a side of Kendrick we don't often see usually he's trying his best to be on the straight and narrow follow the good path but he's definitely getting angrier more aggressive more violent on cuts like this this is an emotional and a moral inconsistency that I think even acknowledges on the song xxx which has an awesome instrumental moment on it where you kind of have these police sirens this revving bass a hard-hitting rhythm Kendrick is coming through with some of the meanest and most aggressive bars I've heard him put on any project it sounds like something off of good kid maad city on steroids but then immediately after that we had this beat break away and then Kendrick finds himself speaking to a bunch of kids about like gun control or something so right there we kind of see Kendrick acknowledging this inconsistency this contradiction this hypocrisy in his own self also I do want to mention that Bono's appearance u2's appearance on this track went over way better than expected on the song humble the trick is pretty much not to be humble at all feels like Kendrick is is more focusing on telling other rappers to be humble it is a decent banger I guess my one disappointment with this track is that there's not really anything to hearing it in the greater context of the album that I don't feel like I already got out of just listening to the track by itself and the song fear is easily in my opinion one of the most incredible moments on the album from a lyrical standpoint the track is a conceptual deep dive into the idea of fear and that's fear of everything from being disciplined by your parents to a fear of God a fear of death in the second verse here Kendrick lifts off multiple scenarios in which he could see himself dying on this track Kendrick also flushes out the idea that whether or not his shortcomings and the shortcomings of other people too are due to some kind of wicked or weakness and he mentioned the idea of DNA again as being something that is preventing him because they're all these things are in his DNA positive and negative that are keeping them from evolving fully into God's light not every tracks message is as concentrated or as obvious though song pride for example with the exception of a few lines in the track that the song doesn't really seem to be that strong of a statement on the idea of pride however the track title here does seem to be a part of an ongoing thing in the tracklist where you kind of have ideas that complement one another or mirror each other or the opposite of one another shoulder to shoulder blood and DNA pride and humble lust love and xxx fear God and duckworth which makes sense because I think Kendrick sees the fact that his father lived at the end of that track as almost like an act of God of course there are numerous lyrical highlights on this album but the greatness of Kendricks bars really comes to fruition when you observe what he's trying to say in the grander scheme of things in a single song because in general on this record Kendrick is not being quite as poetic not quite as flowery especially on tracks like DNA and Humble songs where I think he is making his lyrics a little more blunt because he wants to go more aggressive he wants to go angrier I think he also simplifies his lyrical approach a bit as a means to come through with some of the Papias tracks he's ever recorded too which brings me to the sound and the production and the musical style of this album which in my opinion is most likely the Achilles heel of this record because the sound of this record is really all over the place it's sort of spotty and I feel like in this attempt to shoo for a more contemporary sound Kendrick is not really playing to his strengths the song yah for example while I do like what lyrically this song does for the narrative of the record I find Kendricks performance and the beat here to be really bland and sluggish and forgettable I kind of feel the same way about the song loyalty I actually do like the kind of smooth dreamy melodic instrumental here Andrey contributions to the track aren't that bad either but as far as Kendricks vocal performance here it's not really a fiery entertaining moment for me nor do I think Kendrick makes a statement in his lyrics on loyalty that's all that profound but really these moments in my opinion are just okay it's two other songs on the record that I think make for two of the worst that Kendrick has ever put onto a project for one the song love which not only features akari's choirboy vocals on the hook but also Kendrick and I want to be a lady and what made him or anybody think that that was a good sounding refrain the I don't know because this track just delivers one coronally song bar after another and again I mean I don't know why Kendrick would compromise his sound this much for a song about love when lyrically he's not really making that profound of a statement on the topic and while I like the song God a little bit more as a concept as a lyrical moment on the album this song also features the worst singing on the entire record for Kendrick not only are we hit again and again and again with the silly cries of don't judge me Kendrick sounds like the frontman of some awful Orange County emo band but I'm also kind of confused about the logic of this track the idea that God should not be judging the questionable things that Kendrick has gotten himself into on this track or that the material things the material desires that Kendrick is rapping about having them is almost like being God it seems just kind of counter to things that he said in the past and I get the contradiction and hypocrisy and inconsistency of faith of self of morality is kind of a a theme a major theme of this album but to me this this just did not say anything it didn't go anywhere it just seemed like a failed attempt to trying to make a poignant statement that being said the rest of the album as far as the production the sound the music is actually incredible I love the hard-hitting trap rhythms of DNA they kick off the album really well on that and that beat change up in the second half oh my god that bass the base is earth shattering the instrumental on the song element reminds me of something that that Kanye would ride with much pride the kick snare pattern on this track is great the echoed vocal sample the pretty piano is highlighting the chorus to Kendrick singing on the hook isn't bad either a Meagan looks sexy the very smooth and Spacey feel is way too straight back and minimal to be one of my favorite instrumentals here but the track does a great job of sort of playing a foundational role for Kendra's lyrics you know some instrumentals here steal the show some are really stark they're really skeletal they're really just like only the essential things sort of like the song fear - which is not really one of the most vibrant instrumentals on the track until actually you kind of hit the second half where some really nice faint string sections do a lot to elevate the song the song pride I kind of love the slow sad beats on this track and watery guitars it may not seem like much but the sound of this song is one of my favorites on the entire record I love how kind of woozy and drunk and intoxicated and warped the song feels not only from the instrumentation do I get that vibe but also some of the weird effects and pitches on Kendricks voice throughout the song - the pace of the song also makes it really easy to kind of eat up each profound line that Kendrick is stating on the track the song lust which I would anticipate given its title to be fiery is actually chilling features along the most eerie hooks that Kendrick has ever laid on a track and the song xxx I love because it kind of has this three phase progression to it the intro the banger middle point the slow jazzy Spacey sort of dystopian vocals from a Bono I'll say it twice it went over way better than expected and then after that there are a lot of various sound effects and weird sonic passages at the end of tracks and beginning of tracks to kind of highlight the meaning of the song that just played to the song that's about to play even when playing it relatively straightforward Kendrick has to add in all these little extra details to get you thinking a little bit more deeply about what you're hearing god damn I saw and again I'll say I love generally the sound of this album it's vivid it's stark it's sharp its stripped-down its raw its rugged its tattered its dirty there are a lot of things to like about this album but I will say that it does read to me is kind of inconsistent Kendricks most inconsistent album yet actually not just with the handful of tracks on this thing that I thought were pretty lackluster but also with the themes of this record being kind of spotty and again unresolved some tracks aren't so much a statement but try to embody what the title is representing others just seem like mere references to the topic at hand or really just kind of fail to say anything of significance about it and while yes inconsistency and conflict is certainly a theme of this album it was intentional going into this record I don't think it's always to this album's benefit I do see the value in releasing an album where you essentially kind of document the war that goes on in one's mind when you're tackling issues like love and lust and fear and God and what role these things play in the world we're living in today but I think Kendrick could have done a better job of just sitting on these ideas mulling them over more and possibly string together a more central idea to tie it all together just to give this album more impact as opposed to kind of rushing it out so that his statements on Fox News and the recent election of Donald Trump would still be relevant I don't think this album is a total mess and I think it's far from being worthless and I wouldn't say the album has no meaning either I think what the album means is very much up to the listener I'll say again and I don't think we've ever heard Kendricks dark side like we have on this album right here before but I have heard Kendrick release better projects better projects than this at least three of them I would say and that's pretty much what leads me to say that I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this record Tran you're giving this chasm a seven oh no you know it's not a ten it's not a ten for me then why are you wearing a yellow whale it's just it's just symbolic you know I figured it's a Kendrick review it's exciting you know where the flannel no no no you can't use that way you can't wear the yellow flannel like that yes I am how'd you do that the yellow flames going to say right here till you learn how to use it the right way make it yellow flannels not to some mean is that just I mean that you do it's a special thing for a special occasion you don't just wear it all willy-nilly at all being [Music] you [Music] "},{"id":"3vl5QXJolYU","title":"Ariel Pink's Haunted

latest and greatest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good alright before we get started before we get into this track I do want to tell you couple things we just broke 2,400 subs on the YouTube channel yes and that is freaking amazing and also album of the week Johnny Cash's at Folsom Prison one of the greatest country albums of all time one of the greatest country live albums of all time forever that there ever was from now until the Sun burns out and the earth becomes a cold dark ball of nothingness okay alright also on the needle drop calm right now we're celebrating remix Wednesday a little bit early there are five remixes up there right now that you can download for free the reason why is because so many remixes came out over you know the end of last week I had to just get them up ASAP but on Wednesday we will still have more remixes for you guys yeah picture of the single that this track comes from Ariel Pink's round and round now Ariel pink is a california-based singer-songwriter who is a home recording master he recently got signed with his band Haunted graffiti on for Edie and the thing is his music with the way that he records often it's difficult to tell what era it was actually made yes it is current it is contemporary stuff but it sounds like it's from the 70s or sounds like it's from the 80s and not only in the recording style I know he records to tape which is why his music sounds so warm so fuzzy just bleeding in to itself it's not only in the recording but it's also in his style of playing - he also engages in a lot of early punk music and a lot of New Wave a little bit of post-punk 70s pop disco music there's a lot of old styles in his tracks - which also make it kind of difficult to say I really did it come from the 80s to become from the 70s is this today as it's new I'm not exactly sure here's Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti with round and round man fantastic thing about this track great-great-grand structure on this thing grand structure on this thing there's a lot that happens before the hook actually comes in this thing really builds up to the hook and the first time it plays it it doesn't actually lay into it like it does at the end I feel like the end of this track is really where the payoff is that's really what it becomes big and huge and epic and all the layered vocals are just really laying on hold and the sound the production of this thing as I mentioned earlier in the video does sound like it's out of the 70s and the way that it's played - sounds pretty disco a lot of disco beats in there but doesn't exactly hit you isn't exactly aggressive and in-your-face like a disco track not at least until the hook anyway now a lot of people may be hating on this because it kind of sounds like it's from the disco era why would you want to recreate some kind of mainstream musical commercial monstrosity that was alive over 30 years ago now me personally I see this track is kind of a claiming of that sound the mainstream is not using it anymore mainstream is not using that sound anymore why not take it for independent musicians experimental musicians underground musicians the post-punk movement took a lot of those dance beats from the disco generation anyway and incorporated it into their music why not sort of embrace that sound holistically and just do what we want with it but overall I have to say this track is a fantastic show of songwriting of production there's a lot of subtlety in this production don't let the fact that it's you know made out of tape mislead you into thinking it's simple or it's not layered or it's not structured very well or not Vicks or are not structured very well or not mixed very well because it is and also it's a fantastic show of man's ability to manipulate sound a lot of people are playing with this sound these days and it's not exactly easy to get a hold of all the stuff and learn how to use it and engineer it properly in order to get this vintage style production that aerial pink is going for I don't have any complaints about it other than it could have blown my mind a little bit more than it already did my jaw didn't drop off my mouth and hit the floor and roll away but it was dropped and I have to give this thing a light too decent 9 and tell you guys that you can download this track on the needle drop com yeah Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti round and round forever "},{"id":"0dVNV1Q5jjU","title":"Anna von Hausswolff - Dead Magic ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Benton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new on a Vaughn house wolf album dead magic this is the fourth full-length album from Swedish organist composer singer-songwriter Donovan house wolf whose career I've been following kind of casually since her twenty twelve albums ceremony and I still found her music pretty compelling even though there were some some obvious shortcomings for me the instrumentals maybe weren't active or vivid or dense enough the vocals might have felt a little bit too distant difficult to kind of connect with in any way significantly her music felt super abstract but not incredibly fulfilling at times but still her records had a lot of characteristics that just continued to haunt me the varied roni and dreamy organ escapes her very eerie singing style her music felt mystical and occult and strange had this very dark and neoclassical kind of gothic aesthetic now all of that and more appears on this latest record from Anna along with some very linear meditative experimental rock passages sometimes sounding a lot like what's been popping up on the three latest Swans albums but with more of like an orchestral or a classical edge there are also moments where Anna's music reminds me of that of Julia halter but maybe with a more of an edgy and dark and nightmarish sound I think fans of Jenny Hvar would appreciate what Anna's doing here too and vocally on this album I occasionally get a Kate Bush vibe but obviously Anna comes too much different artistic conclusions is on an entirely different journey one influenced more by contemporary experimental rock and classical music than Kate Bush could have ever been because I kind of get that similarity more from Bush's earlier career not so much from her later and more I guess accessible releases her bigger releases like hounds of love this album is 47 minutes it's spread across five tracks so of course with that ratio you're gonna get a few lengthy monsters in the tracklist here and each song really kind of has its own progression and feel the mysterious vanishing Elektra is one of the somewhat shorter songs and the track list here is loaded with these heavy primal riffey guitars slogging their way over a patient groove orbiting around these riffs are some spacey acoustic guitars and and they're topped with Anna's howling voice the intensity of this track just grows higher and higher and higher as it moves along and if any song on here is kind of like a dead ringer for a track off of swans to be kind or their last record the glowing man it's it's this one the marble eye is this very long solo organ piece loaded with these gothic chord progressions and classical arpeggios it very much adds to the feel of this album has an odyssey as a journey because this record is more than just simply a set of songs it's kind of like this tapestry it's a progression it's like a large experimental thematic music piece with just different movements and sections because this very evocative Oregon Odyssey is what brings us into the dreamy ballad that is a closing track which while I wasn't impressed with Anna's more subtle vocal approach on this track I much preferred the the bolder singing she delivered earlier on the album it's still a very pretty song my only true disappointment with the track is that I just wish the ending was a bit more built out and solid the song to me sort of seems to fizzle out of nowhere I was kind of hoping for a more elongated droning outro that I could just kind of coast out on just send me out to sea for a Vikings burial given the track is seven minutes long I feel like there was plenty of time to possibly build up the outro to this track so it doesn't just end so abruptly but whatever I haven't even talked about the two largest and most core tracks to the entire record which is really where a majority of this album's ambitions lie there's the 16 minute ugly and vengeful which starts up a lot like a post rock song has some Godspeed You black emperor vibes right at the intro I'd say just this apocalyptic ambience eventually a rush of heavy guitars but what's kind of different in Anna's case because it's not just some second wave post rock ripoff is you have this totally different vocal approach obviously a different approach to chord progressions this organ this devilish vibe the emotion of it - I mean again to go back to the singing Anna's singing on this track for me as transcendental when she hits those Wow like those highest most passionate highs I feel like I'm being transported into another friggin dimension the last leg of the song is kind of like a really weird jammy blend of prog rock and post rock sounds it's pretty cool and then there's the intro track the 12-minute the truth the glow the fall which has a very chilly moody organ intro I feel like I'm paralyzed laying flat in a forest leaves are falling on me I'm deteriorating I'm just being buried with snow and rain and debris it also helps that lyrically I'm just catching a lot of nature themes throughout the album - the middle point of the track eventually builds up some percussion the instrumentation starts to ascend build up tension for the final leg of the track that is kind of this very droney shoegazing layering of guitars and a lot of other instrumentation it's just gorgeous there's an aura around it it's a really blissful there's an overwhelming fullness and brightness to it I mean for such a long track it does have a very fulfilling finish and that's pretty much it those are the five tracks which again come together pretty well as a holistic piece of music dead magic there are some moments where yeah Anna does kind of where her influences on her sleeve and I am left not just with the final track but just in general wanting more from her and from this record as well but still I ended up really enjoying what Anna had to offer on this record and it is hands down easily her best work to date I'm feeling a strong seven to a late eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

Callinan - Bravado ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone know that the enhanced ham here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Karen J Kalinin album bravado this is the latest full-length album from Australian musical eccentric and songwriter Karen J Kalinin four years after his breakout record for XL Recordings embraces him an album that I hadn't heard the year that it dropped in 2013 until I think a year later I did a speaking engagement tour in Australia and one of the kids who showed up to the show brought a CD copy of the album and handed to me and said boy yet can't listen to Karen jcalahan and I was like okay you Vegemite munching kangaroo Jackie I'll give this a listen and I was actually pretty floored by this thing this is a really cool album it's really all over the place but the songs are consistently great stylistically it sways between being and Emily catchy and impossibly dark grabbing the ugliest characteristics of humanity by the air and just throwing it up in the air a very weird dynamic to the tracklist yes but Karen's eccentric nature and is very expressive and strange vocals tied the entire album together into one very tight underappreciated package so of course I'm excited for whatever his next album is going to be even if it is four years later and my excitement for this thing was heightened by the fact that every lead track a teaser track that I heard up to the release of this thing was fantastic living each day sad a bravado down to hang but simultaneously I'm kind of confused by the massive featureless on this thing it's rare that artists making pop music or in the indie scene go to such great lengths to bring on so many collaborators onto a single project and slap all their names right there in the tracklist we have psych folks tour wise blood who dropped an album not too long ago that was somewhat well received the equally trippy and odd Conan moccasin is on this record Jorge el Bronx whose name I'm sorry I can't pronounce correctly he has Clyde in the past with Ariel pink he's a multi-instrumentalist - producer songwriter we have no way veteran James chance on this thing and equally eccentric indie songwriter Nicholas Savage is on this album as well and those are just the characters I was somewhat familiar with going into this project given the variety of extra personnel on this thing it should be no surprise that stylistically this album is kind of all over the place just like its predecessor but even though it's similarly unpredictable it's also kind of a departure which I know doesn't make sense but bravado in comparison with embraces 'im is nowhere near as dark or as primal this album by comparison is noticeably brighter smoother more synthetic sexier with a bit of pristine New Wave Sheen on some of these tracks but somehow Karen manages to bring over all the weirdness and all the oddity from the previous record and also kind of make it function on this new one - this album is so visceral it's so exciting to me it's so energetic it makes me want to parade around in my underwear strike and dance poses it makes you want to sing my heart out makes me want to shake my ass and you know maybe just like start start a coke addiction just start a good steady nice coke addiction we have the song song about drugs on this album which is like this freaky lush arena pop rock tune that I'm totally addicted to and orgasmic chorus that gets bigger and bigger and bigger with every time it's repeated on the track and a series of tension building verses that aren't so much verses as they are like these freaky sideshow detours of strange vocal effects and just kind of a weird singing detour some of my favorites being wrapped up in plastic thrown down the stairs feeling fantastic or this is a good one I love you this track is blissfully melodic it's hard-hitting its grand is triumphant it is the definition of flying your freak flag high I also have the smooth funky southern rock vibe of the song living each day select guitar licks on this thing uplifting chorus with some odd falsettos worked in there a very assuring mantra about living each day like it's your last but under the glitter and glam of the feel-good instrumental and in the message of the hook there are some dark points in the lyrics like using this will to live each day like it's your last to shrug off the urge to systematically kill there's also a weird line about a sandwich a sandwich the song bravado is the lead single to this album works perfectly in the context of the tracklist as the closer easily one of my favorite singles of the year I've had months to listen to this thing and I'm still just kind of speechless about it honestly I have the lyrics memorized by heart but yet I'm still kind of yet to fully and completely decipher exactly what the the statement or the point of the song is or rather what the point of inspiration may have been for the sentiment of the song the track features these glassy epics synth chords an irresistible groovy beat and easily one of Karen's most passionate vocal performances on the entire album the build-up to the chorus is great the instrumental passages are amazing it's rare that I use the phrase perfectly crafted pop song and this is maybe an instance where I'm tempted to do so the opposite of the pop spectrum on this album though has to be the song down to hang a very tense noisy and freakish rock track that features James chance so of course it's going to have a little bit of a post-punk noise rock no wavy kind of vibe to it this is the one track on the album that I think would have fit kind of snugly on the last album with the exception of moments on this track where you're getting kind of all these funky bass lines and slick guitar licks that are kind of playful and bright still though this track is definitely Karin embracing his darker side on this album and I love the lyrical theme of the track talking about meeting a girl on the Internet and she's down to hang with you and then beyond that the song is a series of comparisons of things she is down to hang like she's down to hang like Jesus Christ like a Picasso painting like a carcass in the butcher's freezer it's a really freaky song and I love the intensity of it too that's kind of a sound kind of a vibe I expected to hear going into this album the unexpected though comes in the shape of tracks like my moment or big enough for this whole town all three of which at some feature these huge glistening something euro dance beats which kind of take me back to to high school or junior high I can't quite remember whenever earlier in my lifetime when this shit was popular on the radio I found myself kind of getting a bit of a touch of nostalgia for the sounds I was listening to it kind of replayed on this album revived on this album but actually think hearing repurposed it in a really creative way kind of using this sound as a vehicle to release a very tense build-up for the first portion of a track because in that context the beats and everything that ends up happening once this explosion once this crescendo has occurred is actually pretty gratifying this whole town and big enough are equally beautiful visceral grand demand that the listener lose control but they each have their slightly different approaches I mean the former has a kind of sensual and subtle introduction ballad before the kick drums really rock it off the latter has more of a duet quality to it thanks to some singing from star and while we're talking about duets on the track friend of Lindsay Morrison that is where we get the vocals from wise blood a track that I think is kind of a funny meditation on Karin's own relevance in the music industry either they're just kind of throwing that out there just a funny aside and decided to sort of name the track after it I liked the instrumental to track a lot I liked the first half of the song quite a bit but I do think some of the vocal chemistry between him and wise blood does get kind of awkward at the tail end of the song and as long as I'm complaining the track family home is the album's sole slow burner and nothing wrong with a slow burner I like where it's placed in the tracklist I like the build-up to the chorus which is really gratifying but the ending kind of fizzles out not only that but as captivating as some of the lyrics and interesting and some of the lyrics on this track are the story just feels kind of unfinished and really esoteric at least too esoteric for what it seems like Karen is singing about which has an incredible amount of gravity to it I don't know if it has something to do with young love or infidelity it seems kind of like a situation that Karen doesn't fully paint a vivid picture of because he has maybe some sort of regret over it or this is like a really traumatic or embarrassing time for some of the people who he's singing about that are involved in the song despite those complaints though still thought this is a really impressive record on par with embraces 'm if not slightly better i do have those couple of tracks i didn't care for that much the flow of the album is really strange and like embraces 'm a little all over the place kind of feels like compilation in a sense the only kind of you know there are some sonic themes there are some production themes throughout the record that I think tie a lot of the album together instrumentals are great vocal performances are great a bulk of the songwriting is really good Karen continues to be a really captivating vocalist and thankfully the risk that he took not only stylistically with this record but also by bringing on all of this extra personnel bringing on all of these fellow creators these fellow musicians paid off big time I'd say I'm feeling a decent a strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what

ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new xxx 10th Ozzy own project question question mark it's question mark this is the latest album from viral controversial polarizing musical figure xxx 10th asean who initially a handful of years ago blew up off of these overblown hyper aggressive super bombastic soundcloud singles last time i talked about his music at length was in 2017 with the review of his big commercial debut record 17 which was essentially this really half-baked self-absorbed album that I named my least favorite record of the year now was I too hard on the album was I being too hard on him personally I don't think so because 17 was essentially just messy lo-fi emo folk standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these really forgettable rap tracks much of the material on this thing was like the length of an iTunes preview it didn't really leave much of an impact on me much of it just felt like I was listening to some fake deep tortured soul thing also let's not forget to mention that this album was essentially a huge turn away from the sound that kind of brought ex to prominence in the first place granted in his early singles and loose odds-and-ends tracks he covers a lot of stylistic bases but honestly I don't really think anybody saw what he was about to do on 17 coming and on top of thinking his first foray into commercially released music was really underwhelming and super mediocre I think I liked any other reasonable person out there have a right to be concerned about the various allegations and controversies surrounding him so I guess the question remains that since ex still has a lot of fans a lot of validity in the music industry and he still continues to receive cosign after cosign after cosign after cosign what does he have to offer on another full-length album while this record does certainly deliver more than 17 did I would say it's even more of a mixed bag ex covers more stylistic bases across the length of this record for better for worse and while there are some moments on here where he sounds better than ever there are also some tracks where he comes off more ridiculous than ever of course like with 17 this album is kicked off with instructions because what ex is doing is so impossible deep that it needs to be explained now granted some things are so unorthodox that they might need some explaining like I don't know a conceptual rap album about a man who's travelling through space on an intergalactic slave ship trying to escape his captors however this record isn't really doing much to legitimately explore or experiment or push the envelope it merely just explores what x dubs at the start of the album as more alternative sounds which I guess maybe a younger more rap centric audience wouldn't necessarily be familiar with that being said though the sound of this album is far better than that of 17 the downside though is that much of the material on this thing is just as half-baked and weakly structured as a lot of the material from 17 was pretty much every song on this thing delivers a pretty quick instant vibe it's a sampling a very moody rap and folk and rock typically blended together but sometimes separate the song alone part 3 that kicks the record off features X singing pretty prominently a lot of a very whimper e nasally lead vocals he's just crying out over these acoustic guitar peji OHS it features a very eerie atmosphere and hits a kind of cool emotional peak at one point but the thing really fails to leave an impression at 1 minute and 49 seconds I mean it's it's like a sad folk song with a big gargantuan beat behind it it's it's not a banger meanwhile the lyrics on this track are about as melodramatic as as like an Evanescence song I'm tired of hate I'm tired of love I dug my nails into my arms she turned and left all my scars what is my worth my worth I mean the song changes almost sounds like the intro to in Evanescence song with its dreary pianos and faint strings though I do commend X's singing voice on the track now alone part 3 does transition nicely into the next track moonlight which is almost as under written but still X's singing on this track is pretty sweet the beat also features these really weird intriguing swirling keyboard arpeggios that are constantly pitch shifting in a kind of glitchy way it's odd but pretty as well sad while being incredibly short is one of the catchy ER and hooker songs on the entire record features a boomy beat rattling high hats kind of watery cavernous keyboards this refrain that I just cannot get out of my head I'm sad I know yeah I'm sad I know yeah but I find the weirdly manipulative lyrics on the track kind of disturbing like hey I'm gonna hurt myself if you leave me typically I kinda like hearing very dark emotions play out in song but to me this just felt like unhealthy behavior with a pop even ear the song remedy for a broken heart just kind of sounds like speedy rapping over some very sad slow acoustic guitar samples and what sounds like a drunk Bon Iver moaning out in in in like a closet I mean it's listenable but but is it blowing my mind is it making me sad not not really floor 555 takes it into a totally different direction with ex spitting very quickly very aggressively over this Bhoomi cloud rap instrumental it's very distorted very bassy suddenly he goes into this screams delivery where he sounds kind of like an angry constipated Eminem but I guess it sounds like he's really exercising some anger here the song numb might be a mere extension of an instrumental and kind of a chorus a single chord progression but it's actually one of the more solid cuts on here just kind of progressively layering on more vocals and more guitar leads as the song goes on sounds more and more epic and luscious though the song again does sound kind of out of place because it feels like an extended interlude among all of these songs that don't really feel all that fleshed out now the track infinity is like an East Coast hardcore hip-hop track kind of boom bap II kind of jazz rappy featuring Joey badass I can't really deny their artistic chemistry on this track it's probably the only saving grace of the song though I can't really understand Joey's attraction to collaborating so frequently with acts outside of I don't know one artist kind of bringing relevancy and in viral popularity while the other has more artistic legitimacy the song is passable it sounds decent but there is a head scratching intro on this song like any hardcore hip-hop throwback from the 90s that kind of starts off with the MCS on the track just talking shit sounding hard but they're literally talking about catching chlamydia and gonorrhoea and about how that's like gee shit and how Joey's going to catch all the diseases in the world so the world doesn't have anymore diseases it's not it's not really how diseases work I think Joey understands that but I'm just not seeing the metaphor I know I'm taking it more seriously than maybe I should but this intro is quite possibly the worst thing on this entire album it made me cringe so fucking hard I time-traveled back to the dark ages for people who didn't bathe regularly and didn't have plumbing knew that catching chlamydia was not good for you the song go and am kind of bangs pretty hard it's got a decent hard-hitting beat but x's ridiculous lyrics and silly baby voice all over the song make it kind of hard to take seriously and there's literally a line on here talking about how he's the shit so he needs a diaper and then honestly the album kind of goes further downhill from here the triple dollar-sign track featuring matt ox is an airheaded auto-tune ballad with a lot of vocal riffing it's just really generic maybe the second most generic track on the entire record to smash featuring PNB rock which again is just more auto-tuned uninspired vocal riffing X can't really consistently land the finish of a song so of course he's not really nailing the landing of the finish of this album in the second leg the song I didn't even speak Spanish lol is this really terrible I don't know maybe he's being serious with it maybe it's just a parody it's like a piece of Latin pop rap I just kind of feel insulted listening to it like I get Dumber with each replay and considering the rise in popularity of Latin pop music and Latin rap music as of late I wouldn't be surprised if some people are no kind of pissed off about how much of a mockery the song sounds there's kind of a quick turnaround with the song hope we're ex references the parkland shooting right at the start of the song dedicating the song to the kids who lost their lives or were affected in the shooting however it just kind of seems like a like an offhanded reference to that tragedy as the rest of the song doesn't really seem to dive deeply into that topic or anything related to it I mean at the end of the day I guess it's a nice thought but this song sounds just as rushed as nearly every other track on this record the songs gets ofrenda though is actually one of my favorites here one of the better conceptual tracks on the record and a pretty hard-hitting punk rock instrumental on it I love the various phases of the song and I like how the track is essentially all about fighting off the the difficulties and the challenges of living with mental illness it's a pretty commendable point on the album but the only other track that kind of goes into this direction stylistically is maybe that song with Travis Barker which is kind of like a really angry indignant badly mixed emo definitely not a high point on the album for me and when I say Travis Barker I mean yes that Travis Barker of blink-182 playing drums on the track so yeah you have elements of trap on here cloud rap punk rock emo Foulke again I can't really knock ex's versatility and the mix on this thing is definitely better than what he's done in the past the singing is definitely better than what he's done in the past seems like maybe he's trying a little bit more lyrically but that doesn't really change the fact this album is pretty much a mixed bag with way more misses than hits and those are pretty much my thoughts on this album and on this album only now as far as X as a person I don't know the guy personally everything I've read about him up until this point is still a concern for me even though I've seen as of late he's been making some attempts at softening his image doing charity work etc etc I have no issue acknowledging when somebody who's problematic or somebody who is controversial has made a compelling piece of art there are a few tracks on this thing that I actually think are pretty good pretty decent but most of this album is just a crapshoot which is why I feel a strong three to life for on it transition have you given this X album a listen did

new king cruel album six feet beneath the moon quickly before I get into this review I want to mention something in my last review I feel like I need to respond there was just a bit of back-and-forth with me and just a few other people and essentially I was wearing a really good shirt in that video it's it's right over there display it put display the shirt despite us oh yeah it's it's yellow black kind of flannel pattern I really I really love it it's it's really becoming one of my new favorite shirts and I thank those who commented on it kink rule is a singer-songwriter based out of the UK this is his first album first full-length album under this name of his he changed his name and about and a 2010 beginning a 2011 when he signed a true panther sounds before then he was known as zoo kid had some band camp music up that was grabbing a lot of buzz eventually he put out an EP on true panther sounds that I reviewed enjoyed quite a bit I felt like some of the songs on this thing were a little half-baked I also wish it were longer above all things that were presented on this EP I really dug kink rules aesthetic with the bare bones instrumentation the really sharp reverb guitar and his voice uh his voice this dude is a low tone crooner and I love singers like that but more than most people that sing in this register he makes music that just is sharp it's bright it's stark King cruel instrumentally tends to run a little minimal and even when he does have some more backing instrumentation he usually leaves it so spacious that there's just a lot of room around everything ah but it feels like king cruel tries to take this very little amount of instrumentation and make it as loud and as expressive as possible with these guitar strumming patterns that emphasize these just really tiny sharp up strokes he's just really fluid with these strumming patterns and his vocals which are just really emotive eccentric loud and raw yelling a lot of the time I wouldn't say screaming but he does just have some force to the way that he sings to the point where he loses control of his pitch and really his composure part of what makes this album so good and so entertaining is that few artists are this early in their career and have such a defined sound and on top of that it helps that kink rule has sharpened his songwriting chops up a little bit he was able to effectively build up excitement for this album with some really good singles to drop before this thing the song rock bottom which unfortunately does not make it on to this LPS tracklist it's a shame very good song would have added to this thing in my opinion but the song easy easy which kicks this album off from the moment the guitar strumming pattern comes in and and King cruel sings the same ooh boo boo somos boo I'm just hooked that thick accent that voice the vivid lyricism that's coming through with the storytelling and even when he just loses control of his voice in the chorus and just wails on these guitar chords it's such an explosive point in the song and still with just those vocals and those guitars it feels incredibly powerful it's like I'm listening to some sort of intimate performance and he's just plugged an electric guitar into a small amp and is playing in a chapel or in a stone underpass underneath a downtown London Bridge it's a great track to me though I don't think it's necessarily going to be for everybody because of kink rules voice it's a bit of an acquired taste however if this track does not turn you off I would say just continue on if you are into this track though there are still some questions that are worth asking will King cruel stay so minimal and so simple that the entire album will sound essentially the same will he be able to come through with a diverse LP for the 50 minutes that this thing lasts and I don't really feel like he runs into those problems per se kink rule does change things up instrumentally from track to track carrying his vocals with either guitar synthesizers some loop drumbeats some background vocals from himself or even a little bit of piano and there's kind of a fresh approach in how he brings these vintage pop and rock aesthetics together with some subtle trip-hop and hip hop beats there are moments where it kind of feels like he's doing a little spoken-word slash rapping and I love the fact that he's able to incorporate some of these older sounds but not have this album feeling like a throwback or some kind of pointless tribute to an essentially dead musical movement however what I think is going to grab people even more than the genre labels for this album are the emotions of this album this thing is such a drag however the sad and kind of wild demeanor can only go so far if the songs aren't great all the way through because there were tracks on this thing that had me wondering whether or not they needed to be here if the cell P really needed to be 50 minutes long there are a handful of tracks on this thing that don't do too much for me like the track 4 & 2 which for all of its instrumentation loop drum beats and the watery synthesizers some sound effects and these really noodley guitar lines that play throughout the track there's not really a solid tune coming out of any of it and I like kink rules voice over the track but it just kind of feels like vocally he is just wandering this track to me feels like really half of a track stretched out to three minutes long and I feel pretty much the same way about the track sealing and baby blue meanwhile the crocodile and Neptune estate two tracks on here that aren't terrible but they don't really feel like they need to be five minutes long again we kind of have a case of kink rule stretching out ideas that don't really stay interesting for the duration of the song and the only change is the only significant changes he's bringing throughout the track is that he's just going wild on his vocals though I will say the instrumental to Neptune estate is one of my favorite instrumentals off of this LP with it's awesome swelling soulful horns I got to say my initial listens to this LP were pretty exciting I was actually really thrilled to get through this album the first few times certainly because of all the talent that's clearly on display with King cruise just very unique voice his Wetty sysm his sound and his production his blend of influences all positives for him but his vocals really started to wear thin for me on the more musically vague tracks still there are some fantastic songs on this LP like borderline the second track off of this thing I love the way that Qing cruel uses these meandering vocal lines on the verses and contrast them with a beautifully melodic hook that just like takes my breath away every time I listen to it the way it just kind of floats up with these just ethereal tones in the background on top of his skipping guitar rhythms and the song a lizard state may be my favorite track on here I love the fact that Qing crew lands on top of a really fiery horn riff and a great horn solo too on this track put some tight intense drumming I think in the future might be fantastic to hear him write more concise songs like this and do it over a full band the last couple songs on this LP are beautiful ballads in my opinion really kind of bring that dreary edge home for this thing overall I really dug on this LP I'm feeling a light a decent 7 on it but if you've given this King cruel album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is about it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional I want to give a shout out to you Jonah Anthony Fantana King cruel six feet beneath the moon forever "},{"id":"2WnDjpoMxjE","title":"Prurient - Rainbow Mirror ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well excuse the ambient drone in the background there's a little ambien drone figured it would be appropriate for this review it's time for a review of the new current album rainbow mirror this is the latest full-length album from West Coast moyson ik dominic Fernau AKA current this thing is out now via profound lore records and it is not just an album but also in a way a bit of a celebration of the inception of korean as a musical project 20 years ago so given that this is a special occasion we have three discs of material on this thing a bonus disc and to make these recordings dominic brought on two collaborators jim bras and matt Folden and together they conjure a series of live explorative pieces that were carefully mixed in the studio after they performed them in in a session and believe me when I tell you these tracks are really freeform I mean this has to be one of Dominic's most indulgent releases yet rivaling even some of his most obscure and shortest run tapes and splits over the years but what makes rainbow mirror different than a lot of those earlier projects is its size and I don't just mean the length of this thing I also mean the sounds the sounds on this record are massive they're huge the sounds on this thing are really full really evocative texturally this record is kind of to die for and there is a huge element of how how is he doing this the jagged brittle burning distortions on this record the splashy vast reverb all the warped tones subterranean bass sputtering noises and and that's really just the tip of the iceberg for sound descriptors on this thing this record is kind of beyond accurate description at some points I could talk about the industrial drones and the weird tapping sounds and the distant crashing sounds and the high-pitched ringing which make up the first leg of the song April Fool's Day aspect sinister and then in the second leg of the track you have a total sound palate shift of tweeting synth notes these metallic sounds kind of diddling away and what sounds like these singular twanging notes kind of ringing out in a very eerie way and all of those descriptors are just barely scratching the surface of what exactly makes this piece this very lengthy glacial piece tick just know that going into this record you're gonna get elements of industrial of dark ambient of drone of noise sometimes all at once sometimes separately aesthetically and emotionally the sounds presented on this record are not too unlike Koreans last major project on profound lower records frozen Niagara Falls but what made me love that record and what made that record kind of a game-changer for prayer ian is a lot of the compositions on there we're pretty direct also this record seemed to take a lot of the sounds the past ideas from previous prayer and releases give him a higher fidelity a higher gloss finish not to mention the prominent placement of these very icy synthesizers that sounded like they were coming out of a an 80s sci-fi or horror movie soundtrack a lot of these same sounds turn up on rainbow mirror but in a much more deconstructed fashion most likely as a result of these songs being slightly if not completely improvised each song has a pretty discernable sound palette though I wouldn't be surprised if dominic and company went into a certain track knowing what sounds they were gonna use and knowing maybe what intensity points they were going to reach but how and when they would exactly get there it's a little up in the air each song has a pretty discernable pack of sounds you could really think of each track on this thing as being its own individual color palette so while each track on this record doesn't sound the same there is a sense of say meanness to each song here the repetition the stillness the formlessness of these pieces so for a lot of people structurally this record is probably going to leave a lot to be desired it's too long it's too directionless it doesn't go anywhere which sure it's a somewhat fair point for this record but if that's your only issue with this album it's a bit reductionist this album is best moments for me we're not so much songs I was listening to but pieces of sound art I was immersed in or surrounded by if I could just sidebar here for a second music has this really unique dependency on that other artistic mediums don't a piece of music is happening and occurring for a certain amount of minutes and seconds meanwhile a painting or a sculpture is always there it's always on once it's made its it's just their existing 24/7 whether somebody's looking at it or not except for maybe ice sculptures that shit melts of course music can be listening to over and over and over but each composition has a beginning and a middle and a finishing point and it seems like on this record with some pieces Dominic is trying to break that sense of time that sense of position and a piece by making certain songs or making certain pieces on this thing really redundant really repetitive really easy to sort of just whoa where am i what did I just hear am I remembering what I just heard where am I going I'm lost I'm totally lost I had at least a few moments listening to this thing when I was just kind of zoning out and meditating to where it felt like these pieces could really just go on forever all that being said though could Dominic have rendered some of these pieces down have some of them made them a little bit more direct in their progression in their structure and maybe given them a bit more impact in the process I mean sure absolutely there are at least several pieces on this thing where I'm not so much upset with the length of the piece but that I began to grow uninterested in exploring the soundscape before the piece is actually over and while these songs do have a sense of place truth be told some places are more interesting than others some places are cool and vibrant and interesting and fun to be in meanwhile others are a little some tracks delivering a series of sounds that are maybe slightly bland or uninteresting or just don't really evoke any kind of emotion or mental stimulation out of me or just features some odd progressions that kind of make it difficult for me to immerse myself in the track like the song cruel worlds which does deliver some of the most interesting sounds on the entire record especially in the last leg of the song but the track features a few different pieces and points that don't really segue all that seamlessly in fact you kind of get sounds and progressions just completely stopping and going silent and then things kind of kick back up again the song barefoot god which features these very low-frequency drones distant crashing sounds like cymbals and what is possibly like 808 claps I mean it's okay it's just not really quite as significant as much of the material here although I guess maybe Dominic wanted to ease listeners into this thing with a five-minute piece and while the revving tones and the muffled vocals on nature come are kind of interesting would I call them inspired it's one of several tracks that I found to be kind of stimulating on first listen to this record but as I return to it more and more and more the sounds kind of lost their luster for me I also love the high-pitched intense and noisy walls of distortion on the last moments of the song chaos sex it takes a while to get to that point the first leg of the song leaves me kind of feeling like I'm sitting in an orthodontist office in hell waiting for my name to be called so I could be tortured with a dentist drill which I guess is certainly a feet on the album it's certainly more pleasurable than being slowly annoyed to death by the cycling whirring synthesizers aimlessly navel-gazing over a buzzing drone on the song blue kimono over corpse the song path is short is one of this album's most incredible and genuinely frightening moments on the entire record like if I was locked in a room with this piece being played repeatedly at high volume I would probably go insane especially if the room were pitch black it was a pitch-black room I would go insane I would go crazy to mention April Fool's Day aspect sinister again love this track love the weird woozy tones on the song the odds sampling or pacing or whatever it is about this track that makes it feel like I'm constantly speeding up and slowing down it's speeding up and slowing down it's really kind of a mind-bending surreal moment on the record I also like the track Okinawan burial vaults even with it's constantly disappearing and reappearing subtle industrial grooves that guide the listener through this ever morphing textured drone I wish it did have a steadier pace to it but it is a unique moment on the record and then we have the two part Buddha strangled in vines which combined is a thirty minute piece on the record the first part of this two-part piece is actually one of the most engaging moments on the album it's probably the closest this record comes to delivering a true and a very clear composition a majority of which is executed through these hypnotic twinkling synth leads and shots of distortion and rumbling bass now many of these sounds actually carry over on to the second part of these two pieces but in a much more uneventful fashion which leads me into a bit of confusion like I feel almost like the first ten minutes of Buddha part two could have just been part one I truly do feel like I'm listening to a more drawn-out less eventful version of part one for maybe like the first 13 minutes of the track unfortunately this record was not really the gargantuan and mind-blowing dark ambient and drone and noise experience that I was looking for not really a game changer despite just how massive and ambitious and scope this record seemed to be I'm glad it exists though it was certainly one of the most unique listening experiences I've had this year given that I'm sure there are some people going absolutely apeshit over this thing and while length was certainly an issue here and there I do think there are some pieces that certainly were there welcomed out after a while primarily my interest in this record came down to whether or not the sound palettes were actually intriguing many of which were on my first listen but after repeated visits to this thing that there were a lot of moments that kind of lost their magic for me I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love

"},{"id":"uNAm2pFDgBA","title":"Arctic Monkeys - Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Arctic Monkeys album tranquility base Hotel and Casino this is the sixth full-length album from Sheffield rockers the Arctic Monkeys who originally broke out in the mid-2000s off of the incredibly smart and spunky album whatever people say I am that's what I am NOT the band's next album was noticeably more mature but still a decent record but as the Arctic Monkeys have continued along their creative trajectory the band's music has only become more and more drab transitioning away from the dance-punk roots that they rode in on and more into like this warmed-over Britpop alt rock sound that just doesn't really have much oomph to it a change I could totally see myself being fine with if this energy was being swapped out for better songwriting or something but in the case of sukkot and sea and the band's last album that most certainly is not the case the band's previous album a.m. is easily one of the most boring lifeless and uninteresting rock records of this decade it's pretty much been a five-year studio album break since the release of that record and God did I need it because I still talked to my therapist to this day about the fear the lingering fear of around the corner' at any moment an Arctic Monkeys album could pop out and bore me to death it's gonna be okay and me don't get upset it's gonna be okay little baby boy so now the band is back with a brand new record and a brand new sound to it a sound that a lot of fans were hitting me up saying hey hey you might like this one sounds nothing like their previous stuff or hey this is the worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life get ready I wouldn't say either of those points are really valid or invalid personally I fall somewhere in the middle I mean certainly the band's sound on this record is different it's much more showy and glamorous and piano-based with lots of themes of ego and fame and XS explored in the lyrics and the Monkees play out this style pretty thoroughly across the entirety of this record I mean really beat these themes and sounds into the audience right from the get-go with the song star treatment which is a really ritzy dreamy piece of piano pop with Alex Turner singing about doing two shows a day four days a week just wanting to be one of the strokes the track kind of sounds like a lounge nightmare or like a bad Adam Green song without much in the way of a tune or a sense of humor or irony even though the music on this record is clearly coming from an ironic place right from the start with this record my impression is that I don't hate the angle I don't hate the sound I don't hate the style I don't dislike what the band is going for I just feel like I've heard it done before much better whether that be an ironically by the artists who pioneered a lot of these lounge sounds or by other songwriters later who would use this same kind of instrumentation to deliver a bit of satire or commentary you could even say father John misty is pure comedy does a better job of saying something interesting over really luxurious instrumentation things do seem to smooth out a bit more on the next track one-point perspective the instrumentation does a much better job of hitting that nostalgic g-spot and from a satirical standpoint Alex Turner's vocals have a much better balance of legitimate passion and enjoyable camp the tune on this track shines much brighter too it doesn't just get bogged down in Alex's I don't know dramatic performances the song American sports instrumentally conceptually is a fantastic transition sounds like a really dramatic piece of piano backed William Shatner esque spoken word with like a dash of timbre tambour influence yes the Canadian band timber Tambor I actually do think that's a legitimate comparison at this point on this record because I feel like this record and much of that band's discography has a similarly surreal and Anwar take on a lot of these vintage lounge and vocal pop styles which is especially the case here as Alex's lyrics get a bit more narrative and there are some more psychedelic effects and delays popping up in the mix I would say the one major hitch on the song is just the sudden ending the title track is a really odd bird in the track listing here it has these oddly intimate vocals super close almost claustrophobic there some intricate bass and guitar works some really crisp drums a nice harpsichord ish type of arpeggio kind of playing in the background the track instrumentally feels almost progressive especially as this kind of jammy growling synth lead pops up in the last leg however the pacing and the structure of the track is just really odd unnecessarily complicated and the hook is just unforgivably clunky tranquility base hotel and casino the track has a vibe but even at 3 minutes it doesn't feel like much of a song which might have something to do with every passage of it feeling like it's in a constant state of introduction like it never really truly resolves into anything it feels less like a track on an album of really any sort and and more like the theme song to a historical period drama with a mystery angle on the BBC and if that were the case I mean it would be a hell of a theme song but not much of an album cut the song golden trunks features some fantastic vocal harmonies which really steal the show some of the best on the entire album they're tight they're angelic they're trippy they're little beetles esque but it's yet another moment on the album where the songwriting and the execution just leaves a lot to be desired the structure of the track is not really that muscular when certain parts begin and end feels a little blurry the loud and buzzing guitar leads mesh with the vocals in a really messy way kind of drowning out a lot of the backing instrumentation and just overall the song feels blobby the song 4 out of 5 is not only a sturdier song but again a funnier moment on the album I'll remind you that continually throughout the tracklist Alex Turner's lyrics are always referencing Fame and popularity and basically the the downs of the limelight with the title four out of five I think you could probably guess that this song is very much about reception and perception there's definitely a really glam luxurious Elton John vibe to it especially is the band's vocal harmonies pile higher and higher and higher I especially love the funky dark guitar passages that kind of transition the track from one section to the next now at the midpoint of this record I'm kind of hoping for Arctic Monkeys to just find more ways to fill this sty allow and just completely explore it so this album is a bit more enjoyable a bit more consistent and feels less one-dimensional but as much as I may enjoy a lot of the tracks on the back end of this thing instrumentally the song the world's first ever monster truck front flip has this total psychedelic Beach Boys esque Sunshine pop sound to it the song science fiction is a painfully dramatic spot on this album that sounds like a moment of sad clarity in the middle of an exploitation film with like a horror angle maybe something where somebody is hunting down sexy ghosts in the 1970s and she looks fun might be one of the weirder and most quirky spots I love the weird in unison chanting sure sounds like fun vocals that are repeated throughout the song the track also features these heavy thunderous massive piano and guitar leads that just crush down on the mix every time they hit it's oddly groove - and features some really weird sudden instrumental transitions that kind of lighten up the vibe a little bit with all of these weird changes in just the brazen oddity of the track it reminds me of something that even could have been on the new Jack White Album boardinghouse reach seems like there are a lot of to thousands rock artists out there who are just completely going off the fucking creative deep end and I mean even if every result from it isn't amazing I'm glad it's happening but as I was saying before even though I enjoy a lot of these tracks instrumentally I feel like Alex Turner often takes away from these songs more than he actually adds his singing isn't always great I mean clearly he is aware of his vocal limitations and is mostly kind of playing into this style as an act he's clearly trying to overcompensate with just absurd theatrics on every single one of the songs here and either they just aren't enough to make his vocal performance passable or he's just leaning on it so hard it just gets old not to mention that these same theatrics kind of take away from Alex's focus on a sensible melody on a lot of these tracks - the lyrics also add to this because it feels like Alex doesn't have much in the term of rhythm or meter to his singing a lot of the time he's just trying to pack ten pounds of words into a five-pound word sometimes it just feels like the music on this record the only purpose it truly serves is to just be a platform for Alex Turner to be striking Elvis poses on top of it while doing air guitar windmills with hands full of like Liberace sized glitzy rings hotel-casino overall I wouldn't say this record is a rough ride I wouldn't say I hated it it was certainly more entertaining and more interesting than the band's past few records I love that they're trying to something different and I guess I love the target they were aiming at but is it a flawed album yes is every track great absolutely no I'm pretty indifferent on the whole thing at the end of the day honestly now after this record I'm really not sure what to expect I mean I don't think that this record is going to be the Arctic monkey sound and style from here on out this was clearly a deviation and a big one at that I guess I just hope the band continues to experiment and wherever they lay an ex tit it sounds less thrown together I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe hit the bell as well and over here next to my head is another video that you can check out Anthony Fantana Arctic Monkeys forever "},{"id":"QPH3sIULI30","title":"Wilco - Star Wars ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"totally dumb Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Wilco record Star Wars this is a new free album from famed band Wilco and I simply say band because Wilco has covered so many musical bases over the years from raw to Vulcan singer/songwriter music country and Americana and a little bit of alt rock and art rock as well and their latest records have been especially turbulent and versatile like their self-titled album or their very peppy scrappy and kind of rough around the edges the whole love and I think Star Wars kind of takes off where the whole love left off a little bit it is similarly rough and rowdy though only relatively so it's just kind of rowdy for a Wilco record it's just wild within reason even if this album's introductory track is like legitimately a piece of noise rock which I wish went a little harder and heavier but it would actually be cool to hear Wilco go in this direction on some other tracks and another thing I like about this record are the really sort of thin brittle crunchy guitars and the the the in the moment groovy drumming and sometimes Tweety's somewhat disheveled vocals Jeff Tweedy that is the the band's frontman there are so many performances on this record that just feel really live and in the moment especially on the tail end of the song you satellite which sort of develops into this Jam of sorts that increasingly gets more distorted and more noisy it kind of washes over me sort of like this wall of shoegaze egit ours as it plods along and the end of the song more dot dot dot is similarly distorted and heavy I would say overall this album really kind of reads not as much like a clean concise studio album more like just a really good home recording which is flawed in just all the right ways and really intimate there are tunes on this record that I enjoy especially on the more quirky first half like the introductory track like more and the song random name generator which I thought was not only noisy but very playful too but I think the very obvious downside to this record is that Jeff Tweety's vocals don't have anywhere near as much character as the guitars and the melodies and just generally the production on this album does and it's not that the songs aren't good I actually think there's some really good songs in the tracklist here but Tweety singing especially on these more upbeat these nuttier tracks just really isn't there I mean it just kind of seems like emotionally he's a little out to lunch or just a little too relaxed although he does give some emotional performances on some of the sadder tracks here like on the song taste the ceiling one of my favorite tracks on here a heartbreaking song and the song magnetized too especially at the start of this track which is the outro and even though it does get peppier as it moves along in the second half the the introduction to this track is a little bit of a tearjerker but then again there are more upbeat there are rougher and weirder tracks like pickled ginger like the joke explained where there definitely some Dylan isms coming through on the vocals here the song called slope the song king of you where I wish Jeff Tweety's vocals were a little more expressive and a little less standoffish and just trying so hard to play it cool also star wars is a pretty short albums just about 30 minutes or so and it was a free record so going into it I guess I didn't really feel that invested in it you know it just kind of felt like this record coming out of the blue they gave it away for free maybe to just kind of remind us that they're here and they're doing something and just the general aesthetic of this album felt kind of rough at home recorded to the point where I mean they've made better quality records than this and but still III guess it was kind of interesting and fun to hear Wilco drum up the sounds that they did on this album this record sounded fun to listen to in that as I was listening to it was like man this this thing must have been really fun to record and just kind of you know hang around with your friends and and just kind of conjure up these sounds and and sort of search for the guitar tones and the keyboards and just the the drumbeats that they created on this noble noble noble just kind of collaborating and writing and creating and recording as you're going along this album felt so in the moment you know and and and I feel like that has its positives and its negatives dogs barking the positives is that it definitely gives this album character and it gives this album texture and it makes a pretty sound rich but the negative is that some of the performances are okay some of the vocals are just okay and some of the songs are just okay obviously I don't I don't think Wilco went into this album with a whole lot of intentions or sort of clear ideas it kind of felt like they went into this record sort of just relying on the jams that they were doing together to sort of tease out any ideas or tease out any any really cool song concepts and I think for the most part it works but it's not 100% accurate as far as a method goes at least in the way it's applied on on this record I'm feeling a light a decent six on this thing transition have you given the tracker to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think eyes are of an axe and that's it you have to be Fantana wilco star wars forever "},{"id":"iEO6FWFByFY","title":"Moonsorrow - Jumalten Aika ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"oh boy love these tweets keep on sending them buddy never get tired of seeing these boo hi everyone laugh in a jet tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new moon sorrow record age oh gods these guys are a finish metal band who's been at it for over 20 years now with very minimal lineup changes across their seven studio albums this is their latest full-length LP it came out in April so I'm getting to it a little late usually because this isn't usually my style of metal I've never been that into moon sorrow before it's high production semi symphonic black metal with northern European folk mixed into it I've seen some people categorize this as Viking metal as well and a lot of the stuff that is in this style it's to me it's just like progressive metal if you brought it to a Middle Ages festival but I decided to give this record a shot the fans seem to be enjoying it a lot and it's been a while since I've listened to an album in this style much less moon sorrow so and I ended up being pleasantly surprised even though this record in a lot of ways is just business as usual for moon sorrow you have the bass black metal instrumentation which is elevated by all this epic arranged instrumentation the horns the keyboards which usually have these very area theory Allah that fill up the space around the brittle black metal guitars and the blast be drumming and the retched vocals of course when transitioning out of these heavier black metal moments we have these folk instrumental breakdowns with some flute or some strings or a very bony jaw harp which pops up again and again and again throughout this record it's an instrument I know Moonstar has worked with before not typically the the kind of instrument that you would catch a freaking metal record much less a black metal record maybe because it's an instrument that doesn't really sound that menacing or but the band certainly plays it off as if the jaw harp is just metal as fuck you also have these ice-cold choir harmonies that pop up throughout this record that sound like the ghosts of Viking warriors coming back from the past to sing and back up the band triumphantly it kind of gives the modern black metal sound that the band has a very ancient edge in edge as sharp as an ancient sold and all these massive layers of instrumentation build up into these 1215 16 minute long songs that come together into an album that's over an hour long it's a little overwrought but the playing isn't so flashy that the band kind of just Bob's itself down in technical ability or anything like that I actually think these songs are quite coherent and fluid the various phases of each song segue into one another really nicely with some really good crescendos and tension builds and quiet instrumental breakdowns and there's not really an element to moon sorrow sound here that kind of sounds like it's the the weakest link or like it's not doing as well as the other parts I mean the heavy black metal passages are throttling and they're exciting sometimes they're triumphant they're usually pretty melodic but harsh enough to be menacing the folky instrumental breakdowns are usually very majestic and beautiful pretty and all of these elements come together again into a very fluid set of compositions this album isn't really a clutter at all some artists when kind of extending past six-minute mark their songs can become kind of a mess and I guess I'm not surprised that moon sorrow was able to kind of avoid this I mean they've been writing songs in the style for so long you know they're kind of one of these bands that kind of slowly over time just fine Tunes their style and it's as a result of this fine tuning that these very long compositions have a strong sense of direction to them each point feels like it has a purpose like it's guiding us to the next section of the song very nicely nothing draws out for too long now the production it is a little sanitary but I guess I can kind of understand the band wanting to avoid noisy instrumentation or just kind of a bit of clutter or grime in the mix here because there are so many layers of instrumentation here you know you're talking about the base metal instrumentation with some possibly horns and keys and choir vocals there's just a lot of sound going on in these tracks it would be kind of hard to make a very raw black metal recording with so many pieces of instrumentation being worked in and even though the production it is kind of clean for black metal and for my personal taste it doesn't take away from the performances on the record which usually feel very live and aggressive I think the album is very balanced for what it is the band is able to make these metal passages sound visceral sound dark like a good metal passage should be but these tracks are also nuanced and beautiful too thanks to all of the folk influences that run throughout the record and no one song and the track listing here sounded all that bad or unnecessary to me or redundant either although I guess maybe you could argue that this album isn't anything too new in comparison with much of Moon Sorrows past discography I guess you would just want to listen to this record if you want to hear the band do what they usually do a little bit bigger a little more grand a little more ambitious but of course there going to be some listeners who don't find enough surprises in this and as a result they don't care for it and there are going to be some listeners who find the inclusion of full instrumentation into these black metal compositions of kind of corny and cheesy and believe me I understand there some groups in this style that I just cannot get into at all like for example of a incorpor clan or a group that I know has ties to moon sorrow and I expected to be pretty indifferent to this record going into it but I was pretty surprised at how much I liked it and how much of these songs were actually sticking with me you know it's kind of hard to call any single track on here catchy since they're all very long compositions but there are many parts throughout the record that I thought were pretty awe-inspiring I guess I'm just really impressed with the developments like the song meme ears well if I'm pronouncing that correctly which kicks off with these very heroic and almost dreary melodies then goes into these triumphant just galloping huge black metal passages which eventually gives way to these cool little folky instrumentals also the very dark deep spoken word moment on the song play Grove which I thought was kind of menacing and the very hypnotic group chanting that follows after that which I don't know just made me think of my Viking ancestors that I'm sorry I have no biking ancestors all I'm saying is that there are highlights on the handful of tracks the handful of long tracks on this record and obviously if you're into this style of metal try this album out right away but even if you're not and you're just morbidly curious and you're just looking to you know give yourself some exposure to something that you wouldn't necessarily listen to give this thing a try too because there's a lot of things that are accessible about this record you know the metal passages they're not too harsh they're not too heavy they're not too aggressive although I wouldn't call them generic either you know even though the vocals are kind of standard at points they occasionally break out of the usual black metal wretch to deliver some cracked vocals or sound like I don't know some kind of weird forest troll if you want to hear some metal it really goes on a musical Odyssey and throws in all this great arranged and just extra instrumentation without losing the rawness of the performances then give this album a shot I'm liking it I'm recommending it I'm feeling a strong step into a light eight on this thing transmission have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that white if you liked please subscribe please don't die Anthony Fantana moon sorrow forever "},{"id":"0Z9n4DNNsy8","title":"Judas Priest - Firepower ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"oh boy oh boy oh boy tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Judas Priest album how is this possible how is it how is this happening right now what what the hell is this Judas Priest one of the longest-running bands in the history of metal eighteen albums almost 50 years as a band they've literally just dropped one of the best heavy metal albums of the decade one of the better records of their career I mean I guess it's not too improbable given that the band is pretty much consistently released music since their inception it really is a testament to the idea of keep on keeping on and I guess it's not that uncommon for some of the original acts in heavy metal to have a late era album or two that is fantastic I mean priests themselves did it after 20 years as a band with painkiller in 1990 Maiden did in 2000 with brave new world great album easily one of their best and Motorhead as well had a good run in the 2000s with motorized ER and inferno and kiss of death also the band except in 2010 with blood of Nations and there's also newer acts out there such as ghost that in a lot of ways have kind of brought back a somewhat old-school heavy metal songwriting style an old-school heavy metal vibe sound energy not to mention there have been a handful of groups like Satan and Hell who were originally writing music years ago but have reformed to a newer younger audience that have been enjoying the old-school heavy metal sound who enjoy hearing songwriting and melody and devilish camp comeback to the forefront in the Middle's onra and priests bring all of that back and more with this record that just sounds like a full throttle revitalization of that heavy metal aesthetic even the cover art on this thing calls back to that sleek metallic murderous aesthetic that was on the front of so many Priest albums back in the day also the guitarist of the previously mentioned band hell has a hand in some of the production this record Andy Sneap and also on production with this record is tom alum a longtime producer who the last time he was producing with priests was what I believe that the late 80s I mean you're kind of talking about a guy here who helped the band craft their classic sound the throttling guitar riffs the Dueling solos the epic theatrical vocal performances all the anthemic and soaring vocal and guitar melodies I mean firepower is pretty much Judas Priest as they have been known and loved but maybe just a little bit heavier more vibrant chunkier this time around I mean if there's one thing that makes this album stick out to me amongst the rest of Priest discography it's that there are these really interesting vocal passages on your vocal layers that sound really cartoonish and demonic really sinister I mean sometimes it sounds like I'm listening to a chorus of vocally trained demons all singing in unison or just like cackling or providing just like some weird evil color and the background of these songs it's pretty menacing and adds a lot to this very explosive heavy metal music I mean we're almost talking merciful fate levels of theatrics here I mean the sound the production on this album the performances as well they're excellent they're near flawless I mean maybe what's here isn't quite as flashy and intense as some of priests records in the past that have been more on the speed metal side of the spectrum but the vibe of this album for me is just near flawless it sounds and feels great however for me the real draw of the album it really keeps me coming back to it is just the quality songwriting I mean not only are priests sounding better than ever but they are delivering some of their best material today there's so many tracks on this thing that have multiple phases to them versus pre choruses choruses bridges solo passages I mean the songs on this thing are really well built they have great progressions great flow and each one of them is packed with these glorious triumphant dark guitar riffs and leads that have some real bite to them sometimes the guitar work on this album can be really exciting sometimes really foreboding but the most stunning thing maybe on this entire album are rob Halfords vocals which are just excellent the dude sounds better than ever I mean nearly every singer in the heavy metal genre that was one of his contemporaries have obviously changed vocally over the years maybe not quite what they were but honestly I cannot say that about Rob Halford at all on this record I cannot there's like literally nothing vocally on this album that I have a problem with there's nothing literally vocally on this record I feel as out of place I feel like is not quite what it used to be if anything over the years his voice has has shown more character because some of his singing on this thing is just is downright diabolical on the title track as he's singing about the futility of fighting for peace and the demise of man and war he sounds so commanding and authoritative on evil never dies he's singing about the Eternity of evil itself about how the devil still lives down in Georgia I love that song reference there and he just sounds evil himself on this track he sounds like the administrator of my eternal punishment in hell necromancer is one of the most brutal sounding tracks on the album just by guitars alone but the track is literally Rob Halford singing about somebody bringing the dead back to life some of the cartoony weird background vocals get even stranger on this track as it sounds like a chorus of mutated zombies are singing along with the hook song flamethrower features this kind of sassy somewhat bluesy intro riff but then goes right into this high-octane heavy metal guitar work lyrically the track reads like it's literally about being incinerated by a flamethrower and God the hook the pre-chorus on this track is even better like great build ups on this song great ways to introduce the numerous passages of these tracks again just like every song in here built out so well also on the track lightning strike is Halford to singing about peeling the skin off the demon's face now to balance some of these harder fast or more aggressive tracks out there's a good deal of very powerful larger-than-life more nuanced ballads like heroes for a Bruins the song No Surrender the track sea of red that has a pretty extended little acoustic bit of instrumentation at the start of the track of course that song being the softest of all of them here is the closer then there's the supremely eerie Specter in the tracklist of this thing if there's any real downside to this album it's just that it sounds very predictable if you've heard much of Judas Priest's late 70s early 80s output you know what's going on with this record and then there were some tracks in the track listing here that to me didn't feel like they were exploring the band's original sound enough not adding that much to it nor were they showcasing as many interesting instrumental or vocal passages hard hooks tracks like traders gay and children of the Sun and lone wolf still though even those tracks are pretty listenable I wouldn't really skip any of them immediately and overall this is just a really exciting heavy metal album so much so it just makes me want to throw my freaking horns up ah are you trying to say this album made you horny no no no no no no no dition have you building this album oh listen did you

new Baroness album purple Savannah Georgia metal band Baroness on their fourth full-length album here with this release and one of the most respected grandest and most progressive sludge metal acts out there today and their last full-length LP green and yellow was a pretty huge undertaking given that it was a double album but a double album that saw mixed reviews from some hardcore fans because the band kind of changed pace change sound a little bit the tracks on this LP placed a larger emphasis on hooks and just a generally more psychedelic sound kind of reminded me what Mastodon was doing with the Hunter but maybe a little bit better I like the LP overall but undeniably it was kind of bloated if only we could get a Baroness album that brought forward this increase in melody more hooks but was hard-hitting like their earlier releases and sort of boiled the record down to its best elements rather than giving us so many tracks to pick through if that would happen we'd just be set and that's kinda what happens on purple some fans have even been observant enough to observe that purple being a combination of red and blue might mean that the band is fusing those two records together for a sound that sort of is the best of both worlds with their two earliest albums and personally I don't know about that I don't think this album quite sounds like that but I will say that I think quite a bit of the material here can certainly go toe-to-toe with a lot of Baroness's earlier work it's not quite as explosive or as aggressive as the red or the blue album but Baroness I think improved greatly upon a lot of the ideas they were experimenting with on green and yellow this LP flows incredibly well from the start to the finish as it just transitions from one anthemic sludge metal smash to the next the opening track on this thing Morningstar is a great kick off to the album the devil tight riffs on the intro really exhilarating and make me feel like I am just speeding through the clouds in the middle of a thunderstorm the track becomes really warm and melodic and harmonious during the solo passage it's awesomely melodic I think really easy to listen to for people who aren't really into more extreme forms of metal but it's also visceral and really overwhelming in the way that a great metal album should be this track is followed by one of my favorite cuts on the album shuck man I love the driving drums on this track what sounds like tremolo picked ours but you know really chunky down-tuned beefy stuff and it's really tense it just really keeps me on the edge of my seat with this track and John Bay's Lee's vocals his lyrics on this song in a better you Monday about yo shoot I I son that a little fast there and my voice did not really do it justice but the vocals the lyrics on this thing a lot of the time are very righteous and powerful poetic and vivid in their descriptions their moments on this LP where John is really channeling his inner James Hetfield and as long as I'm making comparisons here I think there's a touch of King Crimson influence on this thing as well as a little bit of Foo Fighters too to continue on this shock me track I love the grand harmonious ascending and descending chords that power their way up to the chorus which just kind of bursts with this shot bang vocal refrain and the incredibly righteous and triumphant tunes continue deeper into the album tracks that balance bombastic riffs and drums with some really melodic and beautiful guitar passages as well especially on kerosene which has an incredibly climactic ending though I will say one issue with these tracks and a few other tracks here is that Baroness and this is an issue I've had with their music in the past they tend to be really maximal when it comes to their instrumental layers which at times leads to some really weird mixing and instrument placement where the vocals the drums the acoustic guitars and the electric guitars kind of feel like in a standing position that they wouldn't normally be in in other mixes maybe the drums and acoustic guitar super literally loud while the vocals and electric guitars are kind of or in the mix the record trips into the very somber fugue which is like a little bit of an intermission in the middle of the album which was a pretty nice change of pace and the song chlorine and wine which is not only one of the heaviest and most powerful and harmonious songs on here but the tune at the core of this track I could see being stripped back to like an acoustic version and it would still sound great it has a bit of an old english medieval folk tune vibe to some of the melodies laced into it and there's a huge finish to this track too that I love now the last several tracks on here the album's final moments I think could have done with a bit more variety or another musical change of pace especially given that this record isn't really that long of an album we've got kind of nine full-length tracks running out at about forty three minutes the song iron bail I thought was a decent track but the very tense guitars and drumming on here it's really throttling it's visceral but it doesn't bring anything to the table that the previous tracks didn't already although I will say the song if I have to wake up is an awesomely powerful finisher which just has this powerful sadness to it that I don't often hear in a lot of newer metal music often the songs are kind of oriented around just insane levels of anger whereas this kind of pulls that veil back a little bit to reveal some serious emotional torture going on overall I think this is a great record and I'm really glad I got to review before the year was out I was kind of skeptical as to why Baroness would be releasing an album so late into the year but they definitely threw a 3-point shot as the clock was running out and really just pulled together a great metal record certainly better than green and yellow and again I think on par with what they put out in the past even if some metal fans don't realize it sure it is a bit of a change of pace and a change of sound it's still really hooky like green and yellow was but you can't deny that they're doing it better here and with bands like ghosts having a pretty fantastic album release this year it would seem that the core melodic fundamentals of songwriting are taking hold once again and some pretty prominent metal records in 2015 I love the tunes on this thing the performances are great the production a lot of the time like I said that instrumental placement could be wonky occasionally but it's more on point that it is off a lot of the guitar solos are great in really refreshing which is usually the case for Baroness no nothing new there and yeah I don't know if there's much else I can say about this album if you're looking for a progressive metal record that is also really catchy direct enthralling and engaging then give this album a listen I'm feeling a strong 880 on this thing transition have you given the sound will listen 2015 album reviews are done they're over list week classics week coming up album views will resume once again in 2016 you're the best Anthony Fantana music wow "},{"id":"7jZ7aMkv59U","title":"The Uncluded - Hokey Fright ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"whoa hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review of the new unclouded album hokey fright the included is the collaborative musical artistic duo of singer-songwriter Kimya Dawson and MC / producer wordsmith man Aesop Rock Kimia is most known for her singing and songwriting on the Juno soundtrack in the Moldy Peaches and her numerous solo LPS and ASAP rock over the years has had quite the successful solo career himself really a giant in underground hip hop is incredibly well known for his very dense dense verbose rap verses that are heavy with wordplay his flow is pretty fast as well he's really one of the most awe-inspiring lyricists in hip-hop today now Kimia and ASA are both fantastic artists and they're bright they're both people whose music I have admired over the years that I have known about them but there are two people who in my mind I would never really have a dream collaboration sort of brewing up here but maybe these two have more in common than it would actually seem to be just by looking at the genres that people typically throw them in for one they're obviously friends - over the years both of them have shown that they have incredibly potent dark sides although Kimmy as does tend to get a little more personal three both of them in their songs can be incredibly playful when it comes to writing lyrics both of them are incredibly worthy and verbose it's not is this enough to forge some kind of significant artistic relationship they seem to think so this thing has 16 tracks worth of artistic relationship on it and it's not like this thing is their first real collaboration either as I mentioned in a previous video ASAP Rock showed up on a number of tracks from Kimya Dawson last full-length LP thunder-thighs and Kim you did make a one track appearance on Aesop's new album skeleton like thunder thighs on this new LP there are moments where it seems like Kimia is playing her guitar and singing into a recorder making a somewhat lo-fi recording while Aesop spits over her tarz when she doesn't seem to be singing however that's not the only angle that the uncoated takes on this LP at times this lo-fi recording is backed up with drum machines or it would seem that nearly everything that kemiya and Aesop pulled together on a track is drummed up in a professional studio through and through this album really seems to explore every possible way that this collaboration could have worked expanding a little further into kimiya style sometimes a little further an esop sometimes and as it could be assumed there are some parts on this LP that sort of crash and burn a little bit or where Kimia and Aesop really get maybe sort of too indulgent like on the song why do you hang up on me which is this weird beat collage with interruptions from either Kimia or a softer saying why do you hang up on me which is sort of funny though and I will leave it to you to decide whether or not 38 seconds of Aesop and Kim naming different kinds of sandwiches is a fulfilling part of the album and there are some tracks on here that to me are sort of ruined by a bit of a technical issue tracks like delicate cycle or Scissorhands or earthquake were the vocals with Kimia singing and Aesop rapping right over her singing it sounds like a complete mess the vocals clash in a really ugly way as if they were mixed at the same volume and they're competing to be heard it's like you have to foreground vocals instead of a foreground vocal and a background vocal sometimes the vocals on these tracks don't even seem to sync up completely which makes it even more difficult to decipher them I see Aesop sort of conforming to Kimia style a little bit on these tracks but this could have been done better it just seems like a weird issue not to take head-on especially since not every single song on this album suffers from this problem like the song zombie cafe which sounds completely clean and fine as well as the track the aquarium actually a lot of songs on this album go over well really well to the point where I think this is some of Kimia and Aesop's best stuff if there's one thing that makes this album aw inspiring at its best it's that Kimia and ASAP really love to go into songs with concepts and it seems that coming together only enhances that side of their artistic psyches like this on TV on 10 which essentially feels like Kimia collaborating on an ASAP song where he throws out these riveting verses about this plane crash and losing someone in a plane crash and hearing about it on TV and hoping that the plane you're hearing about doesn't have the person you love on it the song has really murky moody beat and the more I listen to it just the more chilling it is in the song organs which sort of continues the morbid theme of this album feels like Aesop sort of rapping over a Kimia song and this track is like a hilarious PSA for donating your organs after you've passed on the song captures the philosophy of the sentiment perfectly it's really the best musical PSA of 2013 hands down Aesop's really wordy verses on this track are fantastic and I love the verse when Kimmy comes through talking about animals passing different parts onto other animals they may thrive like when the whale gives its tail to the cat or the bird gives its wings to the bat it's ridiculous and the song bats which is the longest track on this entire LP Kimia and ASAP come together and mourn the death of Minnesota rapper idea they do it with some really really awesome just inspiring wordplay with Kimya talking about him saying he's the Minnesota Dalai Lama Kimmy and Aesop go on to sort of mourn his passing by watching bats fly and with the low-five sounds the warm bass the guitars the choppy beat on this thing is fantastic meld of both of these artist styles and the song alligator is a really dark and strange look at sex lust and specifically pornography with a really heavy verse from Aesop talking about how when one gets into porn or is first exposed to porn there is sort of a changing point there there's a certain experience there that changes your mind makes you look at things completely differently I love how Aesop can really get down to cameos level and do something incredibly tender on a song like teleprompter and there are moments where they come together for tracks where it totally feels like they're goofing off on some abstract ideas like eyeball soup or the last track on this thing tits up which does get a little just overly long and kind bull but Kimia does manage to rap all over this track in a pretty entertaining way overall in my opinion it's a pretty good LP if you can get past the clash of hip-hop and singer-songwriter the clash of these labels you will see that maybe they have more in common than we think and I actually feel that ASAP and Kimia expose sort of hidden potential for albums like this because an incredible amount of tracks on this LP are our earnest their intimate their personal they are hilarious thought-provoking and lyrically slash conceptually impressive I'm actually happy to see their personalities come together so well on this project I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana Kimya Dawson forever [Music] in Aesop Rock "},{"id":"SCJ57ntrIQQ","title":"Blood Orange - Freetown Sound ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone new thin utano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the latest record from blood-orange freetown sound this is the latest full-length LP from producer multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter Devante Heinz who has been at it for a long time now I remember listening to one of his earliest groups test icicles back in my college days which was a pretty interesting dance Punk synth punk group then he would move on to do some indie rock and pop under the lightspeed champion name and now in his latest incarnation blood orange not only has he been making music that is very different from indie rock and pop but he's also been expanding his talents as a songwriter and a producer lending his talents to make other people sound better working with artists like fka twigs and Florence on the Machine and my favorite recently uh Carly Rae Jepsen on her latest full-length LP but when he's putting out music for himself he's dropping these dreamy reincarnation of pop R&B and synth funk from the 80s and thus far he's been doing it pretty successfully with two very popular albums under his belt and now a new one now his last record Cupid deluxe personally did not care for this album at all I thought this thing was instrumentally Hollow it was emotionally bland everything was just a little too washed out and reverb effects he seemed to have a strong grasp of the nostalgia that was fueling his desire to make this music but there wasn't a lot in terms of compelling songwriting but it's been a while since that album dropped and as far as I can tell Devante has been progressing quite a bit as a songwriter working with other artists so maybe this new record over here will be more detailed and mature and interesting and we do get a pretty different blood-orange this time around this new project over here is a longer project standing at 59 minutes with 17 tracks and overall this project is more instrumentally adventurous than anything blood orange has dropped in the past I love the hand percussion and the very groovy bass guitar on the song juicy 1 2 4 also the gorgeous vocal harmonies and jazz horn embellishments that kick the record off I think are fantastic even if the second half of the song is dominated by a feminist slam poetry I also love the weird melty horrifying string sections on song EVP they pair weirdly but also nicely with the very awesome bass and drum grooves and there's a great drum solo on the track too I also like the funky horn sections against the very chill synthetic instrumentation on song love eeeh and also there are loads of notable vocal guest appearances on this thing people like Debbie Harry and Zuri Marley Nelly Furtado and Carly Rae Jepsen and a lot of these guest appearances develop into these very steamy dreamy nocturnal sensual duets that are pretty nice and there's also a variety of sound clips littered throughout this record - that transition one song to another song or sort of interrupts in the middle of a track that I think insert some kind of political message into some of these tracks it doesn't always work but I admire the fact that again Devante is being way more sonically adventurous with this new project it's the 80s pastiche that this project has been known for up until this point but with much more bulk to it now the vocals are still a little more washed out than I would like them to be especially on tracks like Augustine and I do think the overuse of reverb does tend to suck some of the characteristics out of the vocals especially when it comes to the vocal guests on this record I think with the heavy use of reverb on these vocals a lot of them tend to melt together and if I didn't read into who was who I would have a hard time telling which guests were what but the unorthodox use of effects and some of the odd mixing practices on this record as well as do vantes vocals do give this album kind of an amateurish charm you know if you like people who who make lo-fi weird throwback pop music like Arial pink or guys like named funk I think you're going to hear some interesting stuff on this project now despite me thinking that blood orange is great we improved from the last record I still think this album has its lackluster moments or just spots where the songwriting is a little subpar namely on cuts like Desiree which is mostly padded out with these vocals snippets that don't necessarily add that much to the tune or like the painfully corny lyrics on the song love you a song that to me in terms of momentum never really gets going it seems kind of like an endless intro of sorts or the song squash squash which is kind of like a single refrain extended out to three minutes and 30 seconds with a few groovy instrumental breaks and the song hands up a track that I like in terms of melody and it's grew and its structure but as I died deeper into the song it seems like this really awkward marriage of an attempt at making a political statement about police brutality and racism and like a love song and then we have the song but you which features these incredibly nasally lead vocals where Devante is just trying to do his best a Michael Jackson impersonation which in a way reminds me of back in the day when Eddie Murphy would drop tracks that would clearly be pulling from the King of Pop or Corey Feldman it just seems like a track that if it had come out in the 80s and people we're talking about it today it would be sort of funny because we would look back on it as like oh look another guy trying to be MJ but instead it's coming out in 2016 it's new not to mention of the incredibly corny hook on this track you have special in your own way you know there's some cuts on here they have some solid songwriting and muscular grooves and these are my favorite moments EVP the song juicy with it's sharp slap bass line and the song Hadron Collider is a pretty good valid to the beautiful pianos on the song I know are pretty nice I enjoy carly Rae Jepsen's appearance on the album too there are a lot of good ideas on this record but they're not always backed up with good songs some of the production leaves a little to be desired especially when despite the fact that it's like there's so much more instrumental detail in this project the sound is still a little hollow due to that reverb also the vocal snippets and clips that don't really add that much to the music or the kind of sexy funky vibe that this music conveys I can't ignore that blood-orange has has displayed improvements on this record and I overall like the mood of the album and I like that the mood is pretty consistent from track to track and there are a handful of songs on this record that I like unlike the previous efforts from blood-orange but I still think there's a little bit to go before this project really Wow's me still it's decent and I certainly see the hype behind this record and if you are looking for something with a synth funk with an 80s pop with an old-school R&B vibe to it I could see you getting down to this especially since Devante channels those influences really well into a finely crafted aesthetic just don't be surprised if you don't find his songwriting to be as sharp and as groundbreaking and as memorable as the Great's such as Prince who clearly influenced him I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this project transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd how's everybody doing it's time for an album review as you guys know I just broke 15,000 subscribers on the channel thanks to you for spreading the word being supportive / awesome and agreeing to disagree when we don't see eye to eye I'm still having a busy week today just like yesterday's video so don't mind me if I stick to the straight and narrow on this new gorillaz album you know sorry Cal oh it's alright I'm not that funny anyway we know well coming off the release of what seems to be one of my favorite albums of 2010 Plastic Beach gorillas have released an album of what seems to be after thoughts you can stream it on their wiki and I guess it's also a free download if you're a part of their super special secret fan club and what seems to be the biggest selling point of this album or just what everybody seems to be bringing up all the time is that it was recorded and mixed on Damon Albarn's iPad over the course of their American tour this past year and I'd really like to avoid discussing this at length simply because I'm more interested in whether or not the music on the album is good as opposed to what it was recorded on plus I've never made music with an iPad so I have no clue what the the thing's capabilities and limitations really are so I'm just going to stick to what I observed between the tracks here now first off I would be lying to you if I did not say that I felt there was at least a little bit of filler action going on with this album guys you're not getting so much songs here as you are a lot of soundscapes short little instrumentals sampled voices and uh Nev all the concepts about a third of the album is built out of these brief quirky electronic piece some of them really explorative and sprawling like the speakit mountains and others more beat heavy straightforward and bumpin like the song detroit but even when i come to like a melody or a beat here and this goes for pretty much all the tracks not just these instrumentals none of the sounds or the textures really grabbed me as having much personality unlike Plastic Beach here nothing is really post produced or floured up to sound all that inviting or sexy if you've ever wanted to hear a very raw side of gorillas here you go but me I kind of feel like I'm eating a freshly grilled steak which is fine it's a freshly grilled steak but there are no side dishes no garnish no salt no pepper no marinade no spices I would even argue you didn't even get a plate or a fork or a knife to eat the thing with it's just a cooked steak so the instrumental side of this album really is not doing it for me just simply based on that reason alone however on the song year side of this album that is a word there are some really awesome moments that I would love to see fleshed out re-recorded revisited Albarn has a great vocal delivery on the song shy town and I just love the cold sensual funk feel of that track really sticks out in my head but I think my favorite song on the album is actually Bobby in Phoenix which surprised me with a lot of acoustic guitar and even as a little b-side Bobby's voice is fan mm tastic the issue for me is that moments like that are pretty few and far between and I find myself skipping over a lot of tracks just to get to them when I'm listening to this album over and over plus there are a lot of tracks here I just cannot stand like the Joplin hillbilly man the opener of this album to all have really obnoxious electronics or effects a lot like some of my least favorite songs on Plastic Beach actually like sweepstakes or glitter fries but the thing is if those tracks on Plastic Beach to me they're still worth listen because they are post produced really well they do have a lot of additional instrumentation and them they do have a lot of subtleties these tracks lack all of that extra production so they don't sound nearly as pretty or as entertaining or as inviting or as detailed or just basically as anything on the fall these synthesizers just sound really rough and unfinished and just not something I would want to listen to when I have an album like demon days at my fingertips so believe me when I say there are diamonds here but they're really really really in the rough for sure so honestly I have very very very mixed feelings on this album and I know a lot of y'all are going to say Anthony it's not that bad it's not that bad man and I have to agree it's not that bad if you're a gorilla's fan and you deeply loved their three albums and you really want to explore into the mind of Damon Albarn a little bit further because this is definitely an opportunity to do that and yeah it's also not a bad album if you just downloaded it or streamed it for free would you pay for this album that's another question because it is supposed to get a physical release in 2011 but who cares what I say you can listen to the album for free go listen to it on gorillas website form your own opinion and after you do that come back here and tell me what you thought of it did you love this album did you hate it and why does it matter that this was recorded on an iPad should it have been recorded on something else or is it perfect the way it is Anthony Fantana guerrillas the fall forever you you "},{"id":"WG7xw2UiKwc","title":"Earl Sweatshirt - I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"he'd without James giving a ted-like just a droid swimming oh my god Denise Danno oh my god that would be horrible it's time for a review of the new Earl album I don't like shit I don't go outside Earl Sweatshirt is a California rapper best known as the once missing lyricist extraordinaire of West Coast hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all who exploded onto the internet with an immeasurable wave of hype and now that most of the dust has settled I don't feel like the experience was completely pointless but it hasn't exactly panned out into many great albums but there have been flashes in the odd future pan Frank ocean's channel orange bastard wolf was pretty decent Earl's beloved debut oral sweatshirt mixtape and Doris was pretty decent even though this album was kind of underwhelming to me I was able to appreciate the fact that Earl seemed really know bullshit about his music and even though I liked the very dark and moody direction that his music went in the very cold and subdued vocal delivery Earl had going and the murky instrumentals got just a little redundant after a while and I guess I was hoping for on his next project that he would come through with a bit more energy and aggression it would really pick things up and bring some more diversity and maybe some more excitement to an Earl sweatshirt project maybe even help him push past the very obvious doom influence that's been running through all of his projects thus far but rather than turning up on this new album over here Earl has essentially hunchback limped further into the darkness with a very rusty oil lantern even though it was a standoffish album Doris at least felt like it was trying to be commercially successful at least a little I don't like shit is way more uncompromising it is not looking to please anybody it's despondent it's depressing and as if this is a surprise given the title its anti-social the slightly claustrophobic and low five production and the kind of loud mixing of the vocals definitely give the feeling that Earl is like holed up somewhere in like a very small smoky very dimly lit room recording and writing this music the production on this album is filled with these kind of warp slow motion jazz chord loops and even though the beats on this record are very dusty they're simple they're skeletal they're moving at the pace of molasses I actually like a lot of them they do have a very strong emotional tone to them some very sad melodies and just interesting sounds the beat for the track am featuring wiki of Rat King actually has these kind of silly children stock sound samples thrown throughout them oh one of my favorite beats on this entire project is actually for the song grief which kind of has this very droney instrumental I could only liken it to something a sort of atmospheric and very thick and dense like cloud wrap but the drone is just so lo-fi it's so kind of just grimy it feels like it could have come off like a grouper album or something like that and grief is actually something this record is very heavy with to the point where I think it actually affects the album's inner workings there isn't much on this album in the way of hooks and the hooks that are here are very subdued and not really some or anything like that they're usually just you know wrapped the tracks on this album are very brief and the album overall is just barely 30 minutes the track listing of I don't like shit doesn't really have that strong of a flow to it it just kind of feels like this one desolate sad flat experience and Earl's very sad funk on this album doesn't just affect how the record and the music moves on this project of course it also effects the lyrics there are a lot of themes on this album in Earl's verses about not being able to trust or maybe even love people whether that be his friends or women or his family this feeling that he doesn't have a home not in sort of you know he's homeless but like he doesn't have a place he can call home and kind of be a figurative emotional sense there people going into this album who were probably hoping for something more explosive like I was however I don't feel completely disappointed by that but I think there will be people going into this album who find this record to be just as boring as Doris and maybe to an extent feel like Earl just isn't even trying but to my ears it feels like Earl still has flow on this album and he's putting effort into his rhymes even if a lot of the verses on this album read like a kind of unfocused and disheveled update on Earl's life over the past few years the lyrical content of this album is about as eventful as you would expect from a project named idle like shit I don't go outside we have appearances and mentions of familiar faces like Christian Clancy odd future manager or Vince staples on the very last track of this LP Earl raps about his interactions with fans and how he feels like he owes pictures to them because they've got him to where he is and he also you know pays his mother's rent tries to help her out he also details the drama surrounding a pretty nasty romantic breakup at one point point if you're not interested in the finer details in the day-to-day of Earl's life depression and music career this album just might not translate to you you might find it kind of tedious at least that's how it feels to me sometimes especially on a track like inside where what Earl brings lyrically and topically while you know his rhyme schemes and his flow are definitely together on this track and I don't mind the beat what he's saying just isn't compelling to me but even though this album can feel like getting dragged through an emotional sewer pipe there are highlights like the very dreamy and kind of jazzy instrumentation on the song Huey or Earl's very aggressive vocal delivery on the song mantra or the very melancholy melody on the song faucet and the kind of emotionally powerful lyrics on this track which are very withdrawn it's a very misanthropic track and so is the song grief it's just kind of this one-two punch combo of intense sadness on this track to aural kind of wraps it out being at the precinct getting booked there's also a bar on the song off top that I love where Earl is rapping about being trouble since he tumbled out the stroller another line where he says he's been this way since the a roller raiser and the song grown-ups which features and incredibly dark instrumental and a feature from - of ASAP mob and who's also Dame Dash's nephew his feature isn't so much a standalone verse as much as a lot of the time he's kind of rapping in tandem with Earl and they sort of switch back and forth line from line or sometimes that are saying lines at the same time it has this kind of weird double the over dub quality to it that actually I hadn't really heard in that many hip-hop songs at least not from the beginning to the end of the song and it has a guess an interesting sound to it however the other features on this album just aren't nearly as I guess experimental or even enjoyable Wiki of Rat King it doesn't seem like he really did much on his feature except to spit a few bars and his verse just kind of fizzled out toward the end and he was just really filling up space and then Earl came in and just came really hard with a kind of relentless flow one of the more relentless flows on the entire album I don't know it's it was it was just kind of a weird moment I mean I'm sure that was kind of a an artistic choice for just how lethargic and uneventful wikiz verse was just like kind of a lot of this album is very lethargic and not really trying too hard and the verse knock he'll dropped on the song DNA while it did have energy to it he just sounded really young and amateurish to my ears this album though still is a pretty interesting hip-hop record if you are a hip-hop fan in any way shape or form I think this album is worth trying out because even though there were only a couple tracks that I came away from saying wow this is a good song or wow that was a great verse the entire record as a whole kind of works together pretty well in that it all reinforces these really dark incredibly depressing feelings even the title and the cover art here there's something just kind of nihilistic about it this album embodies that whole just fuck it fuck everything attitude to the highest degree so in that sense is a unique album but I don't think it necessarily saves it from a lot of the weaker tracks on here and that when I was done listening to it I just kind of felt you know really empty and and hollow inside not like it really got that much from the album I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP transition if you've given this Earl Sweatshirt project listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it like a new fan kono Earl Sweatshirt I don't like shit forever "},{"id":"42RML92tDyQ","title":"Nas- Life Is Good ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"come on man you can do this hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review nas life is good nas is a New York rapper and few rappers have had the impact on hip hop that he has and what's kind of funny is that his impact on the genre can really kind of be boiled down almost to one album Illmatic fantastic LP for most of you I don't think I need to tell you why and if you don't know why just go listen to it now in terms of what happened after Illmatic nas was still seeing commercial success definitely selling tons of records he had chart-topping singles as well but he did kind of change his style up embracing themes of excess and drugs and violence in his lyrics which did kind of turnoff some fans and critics which in a way is slightly hypocritical because throughout this time period when nas was changing himself more toward this style there were plenty of gangsta rap and mafioso rap albums that were pretty popular but a part of the reason why a lot of people disliked this change in nas and I have to say personally I agree for the most part is it was kind of perceived as being a bit reactionary nas shifting nas doing something different in order to kind of stay relevant in the rap wine white now throughout the 10 albums that nas has released he's had his moments where he's fallen off and he's come back but for me after illmatic any failures or improvements that nas ended up making and he comebacks whatever it's all relative because to me over time his instrumentals and his hooks and his song topics just continue to get worse you know and it wasn't even that Naz had changed or embraced the mainstream or anything like that it's that he was never really even that good at it he never really had the ear for beats and for hooks that jay-z did as nas and jay-z were kind of evolving into the late 90s and the 2000s time and time again nas would water down his lyrical content he would simplify a track really kind of make it catchy make it hooky and it never really was at least not in a long-term kind of way because when I listened back to older singles that I remember being pretty popular at the time like got yourself ax or hate me now they sound really kind of faded and dated today now on the albums that dropped after nas is first two full-length LPS he would have his his personal or his conscious moments for sure but they were never really as groundbreaking or as I guess fiery or is passionate as his early stuff now does this new album kind of show nas turning a new leaf I mean I would hope so it's kind of coming off the coattails of two albums that were not really that stellar to begin with and I mean think about it nas really could experiment and do anything that that he wants at this point I mean he's been making albums for almost 20 years and through all the highs and lows he's still been relatively popular people have pretty much always been interested in what he's putting out next why not do something different why not change everything up his place in hip-hop is pretty solidified but nope that don't happen pretty much what you get on this LP is a slightly more modernized version of the same old same old from nas weak beat choices bad hooks song concepts that don't really fully connect and a bunch of features that feel more political than they do logical or musical like Rick Ross and Swizz Beatz and Amy Winehouse they're pretty much two kinds of tracks on this album there are potholes and there are weaklings the straight-up rapping on the track locomotive sounds pretty good but I'm not totally in love with the beat on the song the beat on the track the dawn I actually think is the best instrumental on this entire album but I'm not really in love with every single lyric nas drops on that track the track clean story would be a pretty decent song because it's got a nice storyline to it but it just has this instrumental that sounds like it's coming straight out of Disney's Fantasia the track accident murderer's is another interesting song concept but it doesn't really come together all that well there's kind of a nice background to it talking about urban violence and its casualties and kind of second-guessing the people who are the murderers to have done it intentionally to really be kind of man enough to do that kind of thing but it's not exactly like Rick Ross stays on topic he's rapping a little faster than he usually does but it's pretty much oh car oh bitch and then he turns the last line of his verse into a plug for his new album the track daughters on here is another interesting song concept but I don't really feel like nas brings it home or anything like you do get this sense of yeah it's difficult being a father raising a daughter in today's day and age and he's talking about you know scantily clad pictures on Twitter posting things that you really shouldn't be posting on Instagram but it all just kind of comes off as being a little bit like comedic aggravation that you would see in a sitcom I don't really get the sense of oh man this is a call to arms this is a serious problem album and the tracks summer on smash what a meaningless trashy just forgettable pop rap tune that nobody is gonna care about in three years who is going to care about this song Swizz Beatz is probably going to take the instrumental from it and just use it somewhere else if it's lucky it'll get on a little way mixtape next year and they're a couple really just corny tasteless throw backs on here like the song reach out with mary j blige or the song you wouldn't understand it's just a ha sickeningly bad nostalgia he can't get over just how like buttery smooth those tracks are sour I kind of feel that way about the last track on here to buy baby which I feel like is even less of a song because compared to all the other tracks on here the audio quality is almost kind of like an unfinished demo I feel like the only thing that's eligible about this album aside from a couple instrumentals is that you do kind of get some personal details from nas or some personal feelings from him in regards to just his family life his recent divorce I do kind of feel for him and really kind of relate to him when those moments come up because I do get shots of kind of passionate details and emotion but when I hear tracks like cherry wine with Amy Winehouse that kind of scene Oz just longing for love from this kind of ideal partner it's just coming off kind of lazy and unimaginative what do you want what you want me to say at this point I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to like this you know I love listening to music and I love talking to you guys about music I do but I'm not gonna not gonna lie about whether or not I like something I'm really kind of feeling a strong three to a light four on this LP I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana nas forever [Music] [Music] "},{"id":"2JVBUPfxD44","title":"Modest Mouse - Strangers To Ourselves ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone ring theny ding tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new modest mouse album strangers to ourselves modest mouse is in Oregon via Washington indie rock band fronted by singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist isaac brock who through modest mouse lent his very unique vocal style to some of my favorite rock records of the 90s and the 2000s like this is a long drive and the lonesome crowded West the moon and and arctica as well as good news for people who love bad news that LP came out 2004 and it was really Modest Mouse's break out album and and really a breakout album for indie rock and indie pop in the 2000s as well in the mid-2000s you had a lot of once underground acts slowly grabbing the attention of wider audiences with just newer approaches and newer sounds and fantastic songs and that was true of modest mouse as well with great singles like float on the world at large and the good times are killing me really fantastically written catchy bittersweet pop rock tunes and the deep cuts on good news for people who love bad news were twangy folky really emotionally intense maybe not as raw as Modest Mouse's older stuff but modest mouse I think did a great job with this album over here of ascending from their raw beginnings to something a little bit more neatly put together something more mature and refined case in point the song Bukowski as well as the track the devil's work day a track where I think a little bit of a Tom Waits influence pours through and Modest Mouse's music so modest Mouse taking on more influences better sound poppier tracks more accessibility went over really well for them on this LP but in 2007 when they followed this record up with with with with we were dead before the ship even sank trending in that direction in my opinion led to just an overall milder album just really an all-around forgettable LP for me unfortunately with this record over here and you know I'm not really entirely sure as to what we can say is the definitive reason that it's taken so long for my mouse to follow this record up it's been about eight years since the release of this album I heard in an NPR interview that Isaac felt that you know he just needed to wait for this album and he didn't want to put out anything that he considered to be crap I guess he didn't want to rush this project and I felt like that might have been the right decision to make when I started hearing some of the teaser tracks from this album a couple of which have been a little polarizing but for the most part I enjoyed them the song lampshades on fire has a danceable Rock groove Isaac's trademark manic vocal style and a really sticky vocal melody that I want to sing along with before I even know what the lyrics of the song are there's some kind of zany group vocals on the bridge of this song there are some twang guitars in this track to some keyboards it's a detailed fun energetic well-written rock song and in my opinion it sort of takes modest mouse back to the glory days of good news for people who love bad news and if they could return with a new record here with that same energy and the same quality songwriting and the same eccentricity then why not I would enjoy it but once this album kicks off and I'm into the first track of I get the feeling very quickly that I'm in for a very different album the opening track of this record is the title track and typically Modest Mouse is not the kind of band to waste in intro song in the past they've either started off an LP very boldly with a bright loud sound really grab your attention on records like good news as well as the lonesome crowded West or they kicked off tracks on the moon in Antarctica as well as this is a long drive with songs that are just overpoweringly sad really just pulling you in from the opposite side of the emotional spectrum this opening cut here on this latest record really does neither it's this lethargic string back ballad with Isaac Brock's vocals about as audible as a whisper this track just feels like a too tired to make any kind of memorable moves and unfortunately the deeper cuts beyond the initial singles and beyond this introductory track don't really offer much in the way of relief there are some cuts on this record just like with Modest Mouse's previous that are a very mild but maybe even more so than that last album case in point the song shit in your cut I never guess that I would have heard modest mouse rides such a generic Rock instrumental on this new album over here and that is even taken further on the song wicked campaign we're just instrumentally the guitar tone to the just very Ealdor zack i downstroke chords on this track modest amounts are really sounding like indie rock rookies trying to make like a really meaningful piece of music more than they are vets who have come out with the fantastic albums they have and then there are songs where we're getting really bad production and instrumental choices tracks like pistol where Isaac Brock's vocals are pitched down for the entirety of the song and it sounds like really goofy and kind of obnoxious not only that the lyrics on this track or somewhat asinine a lot of the time and on the song sugar boats rigging instrumentation that sounds like it could have come out of a big top circus or something we're getting some huge bass on this track some drunken plinky piano I feel like on this song we're getting more Tom Waits influence pouring through but it's not manifesting itself in a very pretty way especially with Isaac Brock with his vocals on top of this track it feels like he's barely putting much of anything into it on previous tracks such as The Devil's workday he's just going absolutely insane he's really playing up this song and because his performance is so middle-of-the-road on this track the instrumentation just sounds kind of out of place and just really overly can't be I guess I don't really get why Isaac would have chosen this instrumental backdrop if he wasn't going to give it the vocal energy to match there are some cuts here that are decent but maybe a little save by Modest Mouse standards like ansel lyrically here we're getting a tale of a family trip and if you are a modest mouse fan you know that in the past isaac has addressed his family quite a bit is upbringing his surroundings as a kid i mean these things have been really big inspirations for him in his music so I was kind of expecting maybe something a little I guess emotionally potent on this track over here and this song seems to feature a pretty heart-wrenching story there's a point in the song where Isaac says that this is the last time he sees his brother at least at this point I don't know if it's been for the rest of his life but you know again pretty sad but still there are lyrical moments on this track like do you even know you can't know you can't ever really know how the hell would you know throwing these redundant questions together one after another just doesn't make for very interesting lyricism and there's one track here I'm getting like a little bit too much deja vu and it's on one of the lead singles from here the ground walks with time in a box and maybe for most people getting into this track you might think well where has modest mouse sounded like this song because it is in all guns blazing dance track with a sweet bass and drum groove kind of disco inspired with some plucked acoustics and some wailing guitar peppered on top but Isaac brings this familiar vocal melody and and flow that to me feels like I'm just listening to some kind of dance remix of paper-thin walls from the moon and Antarctica and despite its best efforts with a 3/4 time signature and layered instrumentation really this post rock s wall of sound the song coyotes just doesn't have the intoxicating sadness of older modest mouse tracks above a similar vibe the album finishes off of the track that features all this slow heavy dramatic playing but after all these lackluster songs just it's so hard to get into it this track is for me the instrumental equivalent of going why [Music] the track has really droopy crescendo to it gets louder but there's not really a lot of intense emotion behind it and there's an incredibly weak song beneath the surface of this track to some very weird off-putting kind of nasal background vocals it's very unflattering guitar feedback too that's actually a little too ear piercing you know I I didn't ever think I'd be saying this about a Modest Mouse record but modest Mouse who really came out with an album here where the best tracks are the singles and I guess I could say this is Modest Mouse's most diverse album most sonic variety on this album I think but it's also their least enjoyable some lackluster songs here bland instrumentals and and Isaac usually the the star of the show here nowhere near as compelling as he's been on past albums unfortunately I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this LP transition if you gave this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think Anthony should review next Anthony Fanta no strangers to ourselves forever "},{"id":"OmUdajuMIns","title":"Veronica Falls- Self-Titled ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review but first two things one I just hit 40k thank you and two we mustn't get complacent we're still in the middle of YouTube's on the rise contest and I know originally I was 5,000 votes behind and that I caught up and I was in the lead and I I'm still in the lead but our competition is no slouch they're catching up and it's going to be a close one if you haven't voted for the needle drop yet look for a link right below this video in the d box and it will bring you to a page where in the upper right hand corner pick tnd and then you can pat yourself on the back because you've done your good deed for the day alright so Veronica Falls English band some members from Glasgow Scotland - I believe been listening to this thing pretty hardcore for the past few days and coucher chest has been overhearing it as well cow what did you think of the Veronica Falls is she okay no that's that's the band's name what did you think of the band what being Veronica Falls oh all right is she okay I hate cow church esta ah to be honest Veronica Falls doesn't really reinvent the style of music that they're playing but they do play this stuff really well they managed to add a lot of detail to this indie rock sound while simultaneously making a sound so light simple and like effortless they sound pretty similar to a lot of groups from the UK who got labeled as as either being truly or cat6 and the 80s like pastels or shop assistants it's a sound that a lot of groups on the same record label that these guys Ron are trying to recapture and relive groups like the pains of Being Pure at heart procedure club brilliant colors and these groups all kind of have their own take on this style the muddy bass guitar the kind of jangly guitars made gargantuan by reverb and effects very simple straightforward driving drums and these vocals these boy/girl vocals that sound so breezy they sound like basically anybody could sing them like now Veronica Falls has their own kind of spin on this stuff this thing is definitely a perfect fall record I mean this thing sounds like the leaves changing on some trees in a graveyard on a very gray windy day and outside of the style that these guys clearly put themselves in I'm catching some whiffs of some Velvet Underground of some Pixies or the breeders and I'm hearing a lot of influences coming from like English folk tunes too with how these guys arrange their vocals on a few of these tracks and the vocals really are kind of the biggest treat for me on this album they're kind of what makes this thing both sweet and sad at the same time if this thing is a fall album the vocals really are kind of the the chilly wind blowing through the trees making the leaves fall off the melodies here they're just either so sweet and catchy and just stick in my head instantly like on the song found love in a graveyard which is kind of literally about falling in love with a ghost and on the other side of the coin you have songs where the melodies the vocals are kind of eerily beautiful like the fountain the only thing I love more than the vocals on this LP is how these guys structure their songs the parts themselves are pretty simple and skeletal but you've got a lot of different parts in each song moments where these guys are speeding up and slowing down and playing double time or coming up a little segue or a little fill into the next section you've got plenty of bridges and solos and moments where the vocal melodies altered slightly from from line to line so that they don't repeat entirely these guys really do keep the longer tracks on this album from stagnating which is great now even though the music here is very sweet it's very approachable it does have a post-punk influence you know it's got some speed it's got some momentum there is a bit of aggression there a bit of an edge and that you know really keeps me interested plus this sounds like the recording of a band playing together not a bunch of people performing on click tracks so there's definitely that momentum I guess in terms of negatives I wish this album had a little more meat on it lyrically there are moments on songs like found love in a graveyard and come on over where I kind of wish I wasn't hearing the same lyric or the same hook repeated over and over and over and some of the songs here are a little too kind of breezy for their own good to the point where I I don't even remember them all that much like all eyes on you I'm feeling a light 8 on this loved it loved a lot of songs on here but what do you think of this LP do you like it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino Veronica Falls friends "},{"id":"h9r1kIjo2aA","title":"Fever Ray - Plunge ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone Stu the new spooked anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new fever ray album plunge what are you even supposed to be oh I don't know confused Karen dreary Anderson aka fever ray this is her second full-length album under the fever ray name she is formerly of the electro and art pop duo known as the knife now the last time we heard from Karen under the fever ray name was back in 2009 with an incredible self-titled album which I actually named my album of the year because of its great songwriting because of its vivid and colorful analog synthesizers fantastic percussion the production and sound of this thing all around was amazing the vibe of the record was uniquely dark and primal and witchy it was just so solid track 4 track 4 track 4 track and also it was one of those moments for an artist breaks off from a group or a project that they're known for to create some solo material it feels kind of unique from the music that you typically know them for so here we are now just short of a decade later new record and it's it's definitely a head-scratcher not that I think Karen is doing anything artistically that is beyond the comprehension of a fever a fan or a knife fan or even a fan of kindred spirit planning to rock I'm just confused because very little of what made the self-titled record great carries over onto this new album here and I'm not saying here that I expected Karen to come out with the same record twice though I do love the brooding smooth and ominous sounds of when I grow up and seven and if I had a heart it's again been almost a decade since the release of that album it would be unreasonable to expect Karen to come through with nearly the exact same sound and also given the debut single of this record to the moon and back I actually went into this thing expecting music that was really bold and freakish and uncompromising so my expectations for this record we're much more than just aesthetic but what I'm kind of complaining about here is just the overall lack of quality songwriting well-developed instrumentals and even the sense of adventure that I typically get when I listen to some of Karen's music no matter what capacity she's recording in the record starts off boldly enough with the song wanna sip which features this really tense punchy percussion these weird metallic rattles howling synthesizers Karen's shouty and one-of-a-kind vocal delivery is as attention-grabbing as ever the lyrics also display this strong sense of lust and sexuality and desire almost like she has an addiction to a particular person in mind it's easily one of my favorite cuts here though it does fizzle out toward the very end which is not that good of a sign when you're starting a record and another favorite of mine in the track listing is the following mustn't hurry which features this very low-key primal instrumental I see keyboard chords some deeply pitched woodwind leads it eventually reaches a very easygoing groove that would have slipped in nicely on Karen's self-titled Fever Ray album and I kind of like the very revealing and personal lyrics on this track too that talked about needing a song or needing a person but not wanting to hurry that process to really truly get what you want however the record takes a very fast nosedive after this the song a part of us melodically it does not go toe to toe with the two previous tracks at all and they're very annoying and alienating robot chorus effects on the vocals are a very big turn-off I would say ruins any potential of this track being enjoyable and doesn't really complement the incredibly unique tambour of Karen's voice and the beat itself is one of the least interesting on the entire album it just feels like a redundant series of mechanical loops that get very stale very fast especially since the beat shows so little in the way of progression or change across the runtime of the track the song falling is another moment where I enjoy the lyrics quite a bit Karen singing about the the kind of hurt and pain and disgust with oneself that you can feel just based off of the emotions of another person and all of this anguish pours through so boldly in vocal performance on this track but this is easily one of the worst instrumentals here the swelling synthesizers all over this things sound like they come off of a Halloween sound effects tape the weird mechanical bleeps and bloops they do very little for the chord progression of the track for the melody of Karen's voice it sounds like I'm just listening to like a weird quirky synth beat that's left over from a bad sci-fi movie soundtrack all hope of the record pulling itself together stylistically kind of goes out the window with the song I don't know about you whose funky polyrhythmic very organic sounding drums kind of sound like a bit of a left over from the last knife record shaking the habitual in fact with the kind of loudly mixed vocals on the track they're sort of clipping and distorted obviously that's intentional but the skeletal nature of the track itself kind of makes it feel like I'm listening to a b-side or a demo leftover from that album meanwhile the track momma's hand the closer while it is a decent cut it's yet another moment on the album that reminds me of the knife which to me there there was kind of a bold separator between what was a Fever Ray song and what was a knife song this track for example sounds like it could have been on silent shout and the song this country as far as annoying tracks on this album go is maybe the hardest to stomach not only because of its cartoony chorus effects on Karen's vocals that makes me feel like I'm listening to I don't know like a cartoon fly like they're also these weird metallic blinky melodies the way that the groove and the beat on this thing lumbers and this really hideous digital distorted like faux industrial ways is is so it's not even abrasive in like an appealing way and the weird impromptu like sloganeering in the middle of the track is absolutely ridiculous and once the track hits its mantra of I'm just the title track on here is an instrumental cut surprisingly enough which isn't bad it's definitely more palatable than the most objectionable material on this album but it's not amazing and the song red trails is probably the best track in the second half of this whole thing a very slow brooding ballad one of the most expressive vocal performances on the entire record and also some wonderful fluttering string layers that kind of add a nice natural organic quality to the whole thing and then yet again we get another track an itch which just shows as far as the sound and the mixing of this record goes how out of whack it all is because the vocals just seem so overbearing in comparison with the instrumental which is so muddy and sort of I don't know chaotic to the point where it's it's difficult to kind of parse anything interesting out of it the this record man I took a little while listening to it to really kind of come to terms with just how lukewarm I am on it honestly and it's it's really disappointing to have come to that feeling because I love the last Fever Ray album and generally the knife's music so much I mean this wouldn't be the first time that Karen came out with music that I didn't care for but still but considering this album features a song like mustn't hurry which directly has a line in it about not rushing a song or a piece of music this whole album just feels in so many ways just thrown together structurally melodically conceptually there's so many drab or hideous instrumentals on this thing occasionally the rhyme schemes are kind of basic and underwhelming too it's it's just in my opinion just not some of Karen's best work and which is why I'm essentially feeling a light 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it they'll like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment if you're feeling thoughtful and you have a strong opinion that differs from mine

Bon Iver ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"Bon Iver hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Bone Iver or Justin Vernon is a Wisconsin singer-songwriter who after many collaborations in ep some feature spots and side projects has just dropped his highly anticipated sophomore LP and whether you like the guy or not the amount of musical connections he's made the amount of attention he's received is extremely surprising considering how little music he's actually released because the only other full-length we really have to refer back to his bony bear's debut for Emma Forever Ago an LP you could label as a singer-songwriter album an indie folk album or something like that but the level of desolation and pain on this LP is unmatched by most guys who try to pick up an acoustic guitar and sing a sad song but anyway the vocals and a lot of the emotions that made for Emma such a powerful release remain intact on this new LP but the most noticeable shift between the first LP and this one even blood-bank in this one is that there is a lot more instrumentation to account for on this which is something that Bon Iver might not have been able to pull off if a sophomore album came just a year after for Emma French horn trumpet different saxophones clarinet flute string arrangements piano synthesizers drums various effects - it's definitely a step up from the sparse percussion and the guitar and vocal layering that was happening on the first LP but the thing is for me these new sounds these new instruments these new textures are executed throughout this album with just kind of mixed results take two of my feet tracks on here Holocene and towers to guitar-driven tracks and not just strong and very memorable songs very emotive songs but the arrangements on these tracks surround them in a way where it complements the song it empowers the song you don't lose sight of the direction of the song because that is top priority on Holocene a shaker and some handclaps just push the song along as these tones just swell underneath the song and later these marching snares and and horns just start boiling underneath the track and get louder and louder and by the end of it it is this it is this emotional unstoppable powerhouse that to me is what Bon Iver is all about the picture has just gotten bigger because of these extra instruments and I think the instrumentation arranged around the track wash Washington is done really well to the piano the very somber piano on that one sounds like an old stone house meanwhile the strings and the vocals just kind of wrapping around our like decades or maybe even centuries of ivy growing on it just sounds so pretty it's like a place I want to live if every song here was is focused or is well arranged as those three tracks I would be in heaven but for me that's not really the case there are a lot of tracks here that feel like they've been produced or arranged messily songs where it just kind of feels like instruments come in and start making noise just to to make noise or even spots where I question whether or not the guitar the percussion or even the vocals have been eq'd like the second track Minnesota Wisconsin I love the first half of that song such warm voices such a such a beautiful and memorable melody but as soon as the falsetto vocals and the banjo finger-picking come in the instrumentation kind of loses track of itself the finger picking just continues on as the music changes these muddy drums just start pounding there are these distorted bass farts it's like three things that have nothing do with each other Misha Kant is a track where I enjoyed the song I enjoy the vocals the horns were a nice touch but I wonder if a single percussive sound on that whole track was eacute or even mixed in um Texas is another weird track for me it doesn't really feel like a song it just kind of feels like a spot of filler that exists merely to prove that there are sounds on this album that were not on the last album I've already reviewed the song Calgary in a previous video and I don't really feel any different on that song now than I did then and I don't really have any burning desire to return to it even after we're visiting it here I'm still left wondering why do the manipulated guitars squawking over this track feel so aimless like they're just there to be there why does the explosion toward the end of the track feel so flattened one-dimensional the last section of this LP has led to a bit of controversy mostly because of the instruments inside of it there's a pedal steel two different kinds of synthesizers I think some saxophone Dueling auto-tune vocals some Casio drum hits it's basically kind of like a corny instrument parade and I'm not going to get down on this album for trying to evoke a different musical time period if I came in here and said ooh this sounds a tease why I mean I would be a complete hypocrite because I did love that destroy your album earlier this year it's cool that Justin Vernon can just go BAM and do something that people don't expect of him but my issue with that track is that it feels just as claustrophobic as a lot of the other songs here to try to pour a lot of instrumentation into the mix not only that but the guitars and saxophones just kind of pop into the song whenever they feel like they're not getting enough attention when it comes to bringing a broad spectrum of instruments into a loaf i recording style which I think has been done here I've heard things that come off more creative to me over this I would rather listen to any number of Mount Erie or microphones albums I'm not saying you have to like one or the but here the sounds are so tinny they're so muddy the instruments a lot of the time distract from the song more than they add to the song or sometimes there's just not a song at all the track kind of exists to just show off the new digs so yeah I was kind of underwhelmed by this record admittedly I'm feeling a light too decent six on this shocker but what do you think of this album are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana Bon Iver Bon Iver bunny bear [Music] "},{"id":"XdiGRpg1Row","title":"Mac Miller - Watching Movies With the Sound Off ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"Mac Miller hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a hot review because it's hot in here of the new Mac Miller album watching movies with the sound off Mac Miller aka Easy Mac with the cheesy raps is a Pittsburgh rapper this is his latest full-length album I believe his second commercial release and Mac Miller has become one of hip-hop's most polarizing figures over the past few years now Mac caught a lot of hype off of his earlier mixtape singles and videos a lot of which I liked not because they were deep and conscious and and pushing the envelope or anything like that but because they were just like a light hearted then sometimes a little introspective and Matt continued to gain popularity but he was dropping more and more projects that I didn't really care for and putting himself in these lanes in hip hop that I felt where maybe I don't know a little uninspired either being just a very boring weed rapper or a bubblegum pop rapper his flows were becoming more underwhelming and and it was getting harder and harder to take him seriously when he would go into this more deep and introspective side of his personality this was at its worst on albums like blue slide park and the incredibly nauseating jazz EP that he put out under a completely different name and I am happy to say that watching movies with the sound off while it's not going to be one of my favorite hip hop albums of this year it is improvements on pretty much all fronts for Mac Miller with flow with lyrics production and features with the feature list on this thing with schoolboy q action bronson absol a really awesome verse from loaded Lux sort of talking about the change in Mac Miller's personality over the course of his career an event of course Earl Sweatshirt shirt shirt and don't forget M cjp like tracks with the features on here he's really keeping his ear to the underground and just really keeping it kind of gritty and picking those artists who have their own dark styles and Mac Miller pretty much does that with the production on this thing too blue slide park was definitely an album where you could hear them getting a little bit more groomed and cleaner but watching movies with the sound off is is a step in the more underground direction bringing more beats from clams Casino on here one of which is on the track bird callin is not in his usual cloud rap style it's actually a banger and Chuck Inglish is on this LP as well bringing some beats Flying Lotus is on here The Alchemist Earl as well Pharrell and there are a handful of songs on here that Mac Miller actually produces himself under the name Larry fisherman tracks like Starr room which is a beat from Earl Sweatshirt actually one of the best instrumentals on this album I did not know Earl had this kind of talent in him to produce a beat this interesting the murky bass the reversed warped guitars on here - it's all psychedelic trippy feeling kind of smoky blunted it's very colorful and the instrumentals continue to be colorful on this thing with tracks like avian which has these really interesting plinky piano samples playing over and over and over and when the hook comes through these champagne room strings start soaring over the instrumental of course the beat hits hard on this track as well as the song somebody do something which a lot of people freaked out about initially when it got put out as a single because FlyLo handled the production on this hearing Mac Miller and Flying Lotus on the same track kind of a surprise but I gotta say I gotta say I got to say my only real disappointment with this song is that it's it's not one of flying lotuses better beats it's really just Flying Lotus by the numbers if anything I think the name Flying Lotus carries way more weight on this instrumental than the instrumental itself tracks like watching movies has a really strong trap flavor to it there's a handful of songs toward the back end of the cell P that go more for that cloud wrap vibe and the song matches is maybe the most bubblegum poppy song on here with this really sweet psychedelic sinfully that was sampled straight from a black moth super rainbow track what I really admire about watching movies with the sound off the most is how consistent and then Mack is in picking beats whether they're trap cloud rap whatever it's all really just textured colorful kind of psychedelic and even Mac Miller's beats hold their own against some of the other instrumentals on this LP as far as instrumentals go I really can't complain about not a single song on here now as far as flows go on some of his more recent projects Mac has really been putting me to sleep with how understated and basic some of his verses can be and unfortunately that is still the issue for me on this album at times but Mac does make some serious efforts and some serious improvements the song I am Who I am which has really slow Spacey beat a really fantastic R&B style vocal hook Mac Miller is all over this song spittin some of the fastest flows I've heard him do in a while and changing up his flows to chopping it up into fourths into 8/16 in triplets speeding up and slowing down a lot of interesting ways and the song bird call is is another track on here where Mac does that kind of monotone understated thing but because the beat is so just over the top and because Mac Miller some of his lyrics are so funny it does work for him if there was anything that really kind of left me hanging in terms of flows its songs like Aquarian where the tempo really slows down and it forces Mac to slow down as well and as he is rapping so much slower on this track he slips a little bit in that of tempo and it's like going this pace forces him to concentrate more on what he's doing and he doesn't really come off as charismatic or as passionate and of course there are a number of songs on here where Mac Miller is singing not just on the hook but for a majority of the track songs like objects in mirror or euphoria the last track on this LP and while Mac Miller doesn't really throw out a lot of sour notes and he does save my ears from some really badly applied auto-tune all I can really say is that Mac Miller is just a passable singer on on these songs now the lyrics on this album I I do think they're the weakest link in the chain but it's another improvement for Mac Miller if you're going to compare to his last few mixtapes and in blue slide park and I do realize that Mac Miller he can be a little bit much at times because of all the sort of goofy and and cartoony imagery and freeform verses that he seems to throw out there lines that reference blind people trying to find the bathroom it's for Mac Miller's and showering clever lines we asked whether or not Jesus made a million dollars off of selling lacrosse or if you get a clue what does the clue get punching fans if they get the words wrong or even being in kindergarten putting condoms in your cubby across this album Mac Miller is is pretty silly but not as obnoxious as he has been in the past for sure the one downside is that Mac Miller's thoughts they don't really cover a wide array of topics really you got girls you got success you got drugs and there are a lot of hip-hop songs out there on those topics which isn't necessarily a bad thing it's just that when Mac Miller raps about them they're rarely assembled into a cohesive theme story or song idea but there are spots on here that are pretty thematic like matches where him and ab-soul really seem to be kind of getting a little nostalgic about their past star room where Mac Miller really sort of catches the plight of his current spot in his music career and then there is remember which is actually a somewhat touching tribute to a friend of his a personal friend who had passed away even though Mac Miller is pretty messy when it comes to his song ideas and song themes and just lyrics and verses at times still if you take all these little puzzle pieces and and you assemble them and you put them together you do get a pretty vivid image of who Mac Miller is now this picture isn't engaging throughout this entire LP you're handed a lot of the same puzzle pieces over and over and over again I think you really got to love Mac Miller as a person to really get into this album considering how personal it can be at times I like this album but I didn't love it I mean there are tracks on here that I really enjoyed but some of his raps do get old for me and get a little stale and hearing him sing while it's not terrible it just really does nothing for me plus you have a handful of tracks on here where Mac Miller sort of pitch shifting his voice for what reason I don't really know why there are a few spots where he does it to bring it to a lower pitch and sort of create this adult light figure in the way that Tyler the Creator would I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to low the she brew slammer Dan mutant radio and Baz I love you only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Mac Miller forever you "},{"id":"rTrT9V6MJeQ","title":"Bj√∂rk - Vulnicura ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Heil today so here dude that is my and I know you did not just try to steal my kept short elbow here Bjork is an Icelandic singer songwriter producer one of the most unique voices in modern music instantly recognizable a one-of-a-kind talent thanks to her incredibly strong and confident vocals and her sort of unorthodox approach to pop music with very experimental progressive instrumentals also the fact that she's given fans a new direction with each record from the vocally dense medulla to the whimsical and enchanting Vespertine my personal favorite the electronically tinged trip hop music and house music influenced homogenic her very intimate and stripped-back debut record and the album she left us off with Biophilia which was a record and an iPad app together in one capacity or another Bjork has been in the music industry a long time she came out with her first record around the age of 12 and later on in the 80s went on to play a significant role in Icelandic post-punk and noise rock bands like poco and Tapie two chorus and then went on to the sugar cubes in the late 80s in the 90s doing a lot of post-punk alt rock and drink pop with them then after that she went on to make the records we all know her for today consistently throughout her career she has always jumped at the chance to do something different do something new do something ambitious and in the case of biophilia to sort of bring in an app that would kind of complement the music seem to be that new thing that next step she was taking there but I also think this record kind of marked a change of pace musically for Bjork to a lot of the songs on this record unfold like stories and even though there was a good chunk of this record I was kind of underwhelmed by when I did like it Bjork's lyrics and the really lush background instrumentation created a sense of wonder especially with all these themes of nature and the world and space and mythology coming up lyrics and for me this new record right here volnek cure actually takes off from where Biophilia left in a lot of ways to me a lot of the songs on this record read like stories read like theatrical pieces follow a kind of linear structure at least the music feels like it bends to the whims of Bjork's narrative rather than Bjork sort of forming her lyrics into a more predictable verse chorus verse deal but the lyrical focus on this record is so much more personal not really the same intrigue toward nature on this record though Bjork does like to bring up such for the sake of metaphor or kind of creating a mood narrative wise this album really kind of reads like the build-up towards and the aftermath of a really significant breakup and Bjork is actually as bold as to any lyric sheet of this record put the months either three months before five months before nine months before sort of putting you in the timeframe of the mind state that went into this song as well as two months after six months after eleven months after giving you an idea of feeling the dread of just kind of seeing that oncoming storm or just not really being able to stop what you know is coming and then sort of healing after the trauma of having this thing torn away from you that you felt really strongly about this breakup record to me is a little different than others and that it doesn't really focus on the breakup itself but a lot of the things sort of surrounding it another thing pointed out in the liner notes of this record are the co-stars and co-producers two of which led to a lot of excitement toward the release of this album dark ambient producer the hacks and cloak as well as new up-and-coming superstar producer ARCA who had a pretty big hand in the latest two releases from arc pops starlet fka twigs her latest full-length LP LP one was with my favorites of 2014 I sort of catch Bjork's collaborators and whiffs on this LP like on history of touches where the I see skipping just stuttering since all over this track just feel like something that could have landed on LP 1 and on the song family just the deep dark heavy bass II drum kicks on that track feel like something that could have landed on hacks and cloaks last full-length LP to outside of that and just the really in-depth personal breakup narratives all over this record much of this album is a pretty familiar territory for Bjork I think there are a lot of similarities between this record and Biophilia and considering the very subtle ever-evolving beats on this record combined with the lush strings and just really theatrical vocals this album in a lot of ways feels kind of like Vespertine for Bjork to go back to that sound on right here I think is kind of fitting given the romantic and sometimes very sexual content that we see on that record which was likely inspired by the same romantic relationship that we see in its demise here so while this help he isn't really that the the new sound or direction I was hoping for given the collaborators and the fact Bjork always has something new up her sleeve I do think this album still stands strong as an elaboration of one of my favorite moments in Bjork's career the record kicks off with three tracks which are the settler more primordial songs which the album's more intense emotions grow from later on you have the song stone milker which is kind of foreshadowing toward the demise of this relationship thanks to a lot of shortcomings some emotional needs aren't being met there's a lack of mutual RESP ect there are feelings that must be synchronised I love how Bjork can take the emotional language of love and approach it in a way that is beautiful and poetic but also kind of scientific and calculated like a robot trying to make sense of emotions or something moving on to the next song Lyons song I love the very tight slightly manipulated into strange chilling vocal harmonies all over this track really makes it highlight and lyrically on this song we seem to have bj√∂rk alluding to a war or a fight of some sort and fretting really just worrying about whether or not this love she has going is going to survive this fight or this war and she kind of compares maintaining this love to taming a lion which I don't really think she has any patience for and then on the next song which features my favorite lyrics on the entire record a history of touches this track is all about the difficulty of just filing through all of those left over positive beautiful and endearing memories that you might have left over building up to and after the breakup point especially those memories of a more sexual nature while in one context at one point in the relationship they could be beautiful after words after the demise oh they could sort of be torture 'some is that even a word I don't know and the way she describes dealing with these memories sort of being overwhelmed by them and facing all of them at once it kind of reminds me of the that recent film interstellar the way Matthew McConaughey toward the end of the movie spoilers was seeing all of these various memories and sort of time hallways I guess she could say of his daughter's room it at various points it kind of seemed like Bjork was floating in this purgatory of just sort of seeing all of these different memories around her all at once and not really knowing how to deal with it then we get the 10-minute Black Lake instant mood change on this track just turn so gloomy so fast the track is profoundly sad and really theatrical about her vocals just constantly swell and shrink in volume there's some wonderful swelling strings on this track too and amazing beat shift in the second half and the way she describes this love being torn away from her at this point she feels naked she's missing something really essential to her being like a womb or a shield for protection and the song family kind of takes on the way this relationship breaking apart affects the people outside of it specifically children who might be you know sort of relying on the foundation of these two people and again this is another reason I really like the way this album approaches this theme while it's dealing with a cliche topic it concerns itself with sort of the minor outer lying things that aren't usually discussed in length the stuff that on the surface while it may seem less dramatic and sexy and intense Bjork still finds a very large amount of heartbreak in these moments and translates them onto the record musically and lyrically really nicely and while the final three songs on this record don't really feel like they are placed in any kind of specific timeline in the grander scheme of the tale that's told in the first six tracks they do concern themselves with a lot of the same themes we had Adam dance with Antony from Antony and the Johnsons and while I've never really been a big fan of that project and Antony's vocals have never really rubbed me the right way I think the way he accompanies Bjork on this track is is really wonderful I think that her and the way that Antony both just have a penchant for chamber pop and their their eccentric vocal styles really does make them kindred spirits and they just play together really well on this track and when Antony sort of takes the spotlight on this song the way that he's saying was just kind of sound like a weird warped glitched out voice he's got a really strong vibrato that just sounds over taken with emotion of course the strings continue on this track the song also features some of the busiest percussion on the record some strange glitchy electronics and Bjork's lyrics on this track are some of my favorite on the entire record one of the stranger metaphors on the entire LP - talking about - coral reefs that are I guess sort of thirsty in low tide and they're looking for this ocean of love - I guess kind of quenched them and bring them back to life the track mouths mantra while it's not a bad song I guess I was sort of expecting a maybe a bigger lead up to the finish of the album though the really dreary 3/4 strings are pretty nice and do feel sort of waltz ish even if the electronic percussion does kind of take that vibe away as the song progresses and the some quicksand I'm a little torn on it I wish the track wasn't so short I wish the ending wasn't so abrupt but looking at the song simply from a lyrical standpoint it does bring the album quite a bit of closure I think and I think maybe in a grander more abstract sense deals with a lot of the feelings addressed on the song family and despite its brevity the song does feature one of the denser more intricate instrumentals on the entire record a really great melody - and even though this album will be categorized as a breakup record it does leave that album off feeling a kind of hopeful in a sense I feel like the way that the mother figure and the child figure on this track are connected kind of staves off the sense of loneliness and a dread that's so tangible on many of the other tracks here above that I think we just have a collection of really well written well composed well produced and just really gorgeously performed art pop and chamber pop songs here I think they're really nimble and dynamic and detailed string arrangements pair very nicely with the quiet but incredibly detailed beats and even without reading too much in the lyrics or the overall narrative the album does have a very nice flow to it and feels like it works in three very distinct parts while it's not incredibly catchy or immediate or hard-hitting if you're looking for something that's a bit slower more emotional more melodic and soul touching I would say give this record listen I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana volna Keira forever "},{"id":"U78NIj16Ou0","title":"Guided by Voices- Let's Go Eat the Factory ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"guided by voices they're back hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review this is the latest LP from guided by voices a legendary Ohio indie rock group I mentioned them in my recent Neutral Milk Hotel review where I said they were experimenting and innovating along with some of the greatest underground and Lofa rock acts of the 90s and part of what made guided by voices so unique is just the amount of influences that their music showcase just psychedelic rock British Invasion blues garage punk and post-punk prog rock art rock power pop noise just avant-garde tracks that didn't really seem to have any kind of form or direction guided by voices albums are notorious for just not sticking to one thing which is what part of what keeps listening through guided by voices album so interesting because you never know where the next song is gonna go the only thing that brought many of these bands releases any consistency was their low fiber cording style Robert Pollard's vocals and just this general oddness now this is the first album guided by voices has released since a hiatus they imposed on themselves in 2004 and now they're back with an older older lineup that used to be around when guided by voices was considered to be putting out some of their best material and this album is kind of being promoted as a return to form or return to some of the Bands best LPS like be thousand and alien lanes and even though the hiatus guided by voices took wasn't really all that long this band getting back together has stirred up a lot of talk again and it doesn't look like these guys are going to jump in and jump out either because we've got this record and another record coming down the pipe spring this year titled class clown spots a UFO but for now we have this record the first installment says these guys have gotten back together let's go eat the factory on this LP we have almost two dozen songs of various lengths styles and audio qualities guided by voices really is up to its old tricks again because they have really turned their back on the cleaner sounds and the more developed songwriting or the more traditional songwriting rather that was on their later releases this LP is pretty much everything you would expect from a classic guided by voices album it really has everything maybe it's not as low Phi as it used to be but I think the only thing it's truly truly missing is the nineties you know like a time period when this stuff would have sounded fresh and groundbreaking not to say this album is terrible not to say it's bad but sometimes going backwards to reclaim past glory can be a little like setting yourself up for failure hardcore fans will be pleased and that's not necessarily a bad thing as far as the meat and potatoes of this album goes I just think it's a load of hits and misses but it's mostly hits right from the opening track the the very distorted and low fyg ATAR chords are back drums are buried in the mix and Robert Pollard's very aged vocalists just kind of lost in the chaos and the track still has that guided by voices calling card of of sounding like something I've heard somewhere before but kind of like a bizarro version of it the next moment on this LP where a song really hits me is definitely don't afore a snow man it's one of the weirdest and prettiest tunes on this album these really lazy flat vocals are delivering this this very strange and surreal imagery that I have no idea how to interpret and you know even though the vocals do feel a little off pitch they're kind of also very calming to me too because they don't seem very eerie forceful just really chill though the guitar chords just had this really kind of friendly character to them and the overall feel the song is just really and inviting the tune is sure but it ties everything up really nicely toward the end the track hang mr. kite is a nice change of pace on the album there is nothing in the way of Pollard's voice and he just has this kind of godly atmospheric reverb on his vocal he is singing about this kite there are these very sobering cellos in the background it just has this heavy heavy feeling of seriousness to it but I don't know what is so serious about it as far as length goes it's another short track but guided by voices really knows how to pack a lot of punch when they want to in a short amount of time another track where I feel like Pollard's voice kind of steals the spotlight is my Europa and that song is nothing more than just his vocal and a guitar with a with a watery sort of affect on it it's kind of noisy but the vocal melody in the hook is just really striking to me the song old bones which actually in a way kind of sounds like a very chilled out sense scape diversion of auld lang syne was so pretty that I almost I wanted to cry a little bit to it those are like my favorites you know but there are a lot of tracks on here that I feel like have nice qualities but they don't stick to me all that much the song waves has this really kind of fun droney quality to it Imperial race horsing has a really nice touch of horns on it and the big hat and Toy Show is like a blues jam going horribly horribly wrong but in a kind of a luring way a lot of tracks on here just don't have hooks that stick with me or they end so abruptly they don't leave an impact I just know some of the tracks here would have been more likable to me if they were more fleshed out and I know that's that's a weird request or expectation for a guided by voices record but that sometimes I just feel like this album is just a scramble of different song sketches I think some people would call it filler I wouldn't call it filler though because some of the song ideas on here pretty good overall I thought this helped he was pretty good not exactly breaking new ground something for the fans but still standing proudly as a righteous pillar of we yes but what does Cal think sky with their voices it's not like I'm a psychic now lalla gist we have fun here feelin a strong six yeah but a strong six on this but what do you think do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantino guided by voices forever "},{"id":"tTUBoFVi-HY","title":"Daft Punk - Random Access Memories ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"random access memories hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new Daft Punk album random access memories the kings of French house are back with a new full-length album that has been quite the buzz for a good chunk of this year thanks to an incredibly hot single that was dropped before the release of this album get lucky and what has also really turned heads about this new full-length is the very diverse set of collaborators that Daft Punk is brought on board to create this album guitarist Nile Rodgers panda bear from Animal Collective pianist composer Chilly Gonzales songwriter Paul Williams Pharrell and Julian Casablancas from The Strokes but what's even crazier about this LP is the direction that Thomas and guide man take the music in if you're my age or a little older you remember growing up and sort of coming of age with very hot singles like one more time harder better faster stronger and around the world of course the LP these songs came from discovery is solid from front to back on top of that the release of interstellar five five five five and prior to that homework it was almost as if Daft Punk was getting better and better and could do no wrong however the duo did hit a minor snag in the mid-2000s with the release of human after all the album overall was much less thematic than Discovery on top of that the very thin distorted production all over this album with the very repetitive grooves and slight rock influence certainly some good singles came out of this LP but there were some kind of shaky deep cuts because the effects and the aesthetic that Daft Punk were going for on this album really overshadowed and sort of choked off what quality the tunes had to offer still as Daft Punk moved on past human after all it was the timelessness of their previous singles that went on to define them not only that but they dropped a very stellar live album in 2007 and went on to produce what some people consider to be a pretty quality soundtrack with Tron and even though that was a huge project for Daft Punk and brought them a lot of exposure this new album of theirs might be a bit more ambitious especially since they're kind of throwing their trademark sound out the window on this album they're abandoning house music and instead embracing the sounds of 70s and 80s synth funk disco soft rock as well and this isn't like another human after all whether taking on rock music and doing it with electronics there's a ton of live instrumentation on this new album while some people may argue that this is Daft Punk drifting away from their roots I think that this is them getting to the roots of their roots and re envisioning it in a way that feels like it's authentically them it's kind of a risk for Daft Punk even if they do keep their handy vocoders very close at their sides now this new sound that Daft Punk is shooting for on this LP it spells out a much livelier and lighter sound on this album tracks like get lucky sound like a very nostalgic pastel fun-loving night out at Studio 54 not some kind of 2:00 a.m. rave session with banging bass and massive speakers in a gritty grimy downtown club Daft Punk is not the only major electronic music artist in recent years to trade in many of the electronics that they typically futz with for more live instrumentation and a somewhat vintage feel you can look at square pusher with a few of his most recent albums as well as what he was doing with Shova leader one or even Daft Punk worshipers justice with what they were doing on their last full length album audio-video disco an album where justice was fussing around with a lot of the same musical movements that Daft Punk is on random access memories now this new LP of Daft Punk's has a very clean shimmering rich production sound lots of drums very snappy tons of kick and hi-hat on this thing the guitars have a nice sharp metallic tone to them and bounce very playfully when Nile Rodgers brings his trademark strumming patterns this album doesn't really get hot and heavy with the horn sections this isn't a KC and the Sunshine Band kind of thing as shown on the opening track from the cell P a lot of the crescendos builds and extra instrumentation is executed with electronics vocoder vocals synthesizers of many shapes and size as many tracks on this LP field disco but it's executed with a somewhat more modern flair as if this disco music had occurred and had been recorded in the 80s and I do realize we've seen melds of these two ideas in the past through genres like euro disco electro disco Italo disco historically we can see that the music in the 70s and that the music in the 80s happened right next door to each other but Daft Punk makes a record here that brings these eras right on top of each other brings out their commonalities in a way that feels very natural light-hearted fun occasionally cheesy but also ambitious and kind of cinematic it points like I said they're very sharp punchy disco tracks on this thing like the opener give life back to music the song has a sweet infectious vocal melody that I love and I love the mantra of this track about man giving life back to music I'm feeling that and when this song goes for a rush of instrumentation the distorted guitars come in and it kind of feels like I'm listening to some kind of huge instrumental break from an 80s arena rock or prog rock song instrumentally tracks like this one don't just feel like loosely grooved out and perform dance songs they feel very methodical and kind of composed like the song lose yourself to dance come out come out come out come out moments like this are very carefully layered over the grooves and happen at precise points to make the music continue to be engaging from beginning to end this song and the track get lucky are both fronted vocally by Pharrell and these songs take a lot of disco sounds a lot of disco grooves but repeat them out with sort of a house electronic music mentality I will say the only shortcoming of these two tracks and it hurts the song lose yourself to dance even more is that Pharrell's falsetto on these songs isn't the best he's no Barry Gibb get lucky because he does work in more of his mid range does go over a lot better and has grown on me since I first heard it and believe me I've heard it dozens of times since it first dropped on the Internet the hook on this track is hella catchy and I love the way the beat shifts from when Pharrell is singing to when dat Punk comes in with the vocoder vocals it is a nice change in groove the track is so good it's making Cal want to get lucky yes baby even the song instant crush isn't bad which features Julian Casablancas on vocals the only thing I didn't really care for on this track was that the vocoders were just a little Miravalle for me on this song still tuned wise the track wasn't bad it had some downstroke guitars on it sort of felt like a stroke song but with a bit of an electronic edge to it on the song fragments of time which is one of the least electronic tracks on this LP Daft Punk brings on electronic music producer Todd Edwards to front this song vocally which is essentially a pretty sweet piece of soft rock though this track does sort of expose a flaw overall on random access memories yes Daft Punk is reaching back but there are some spots on the selkie where I wish things fell or just sounded a little bit more novel and I think some people are going to feel that way considering Daft Punk's pioneer electronic music status they've got their own sound they've got their own style why copy ideas from the Boston playbook still the song is done pretty well and the way I see it and enjoy is just by sort of taking it as one part in the larger picture of random access memories which to me is an expression of a group of different musical eras enacted animatronic Lee in this glorious Museum of the future disco smooth funk and soft rock are not the only things that are worshipped on this LP there's some very sensual and beautiful slow jams and ballads on this album as well songs like within beyond and the game of love now think what you want to think about these tracks they're soft they're not the most hard-hitting or anything like that but to me these songs are the closest Daft Punk come to doing something that is more alike to their older stuff if you take a song from Discovery like something about us where you've got very jagged bass lines a slow groove that's very disco influenced guitars and since adding a little bit of color here and there and of course vocoder vocals those robot vocals singing upfront a very strong melody a ballad and lot York's about love what daftpunk does on these slow Jamz off this album they've done before and they're doing it just as well here as they have in the past while some people have criticized the lyrical content of tracks like lose yourself to dance and get lucky certainly Daft Punk makes up for that on these tracks by proving that their lyrical prowess is still there the track game of love is incredibly heartbreaking with its portrayal of dying love in its lyrics the song within lyrically to me is very surreal and gives me the listener a sense of just smallness in this gigantic big difficult to understand world and lyrically the song beyond to me is like a very passionate journey of the soul somewhat sad and forlorn one too and on the beginning of this track Daft Punk bringing in a huge epic string section really flexing that instrumental muscle that they brought through on Tron it speaks of places never seen it is the birthplace of your dreams and as far as another slow jam on this LP doing it right with pandabear actually surprised me a lot and turned out to be incredibly good and enjoyable typically when I catch a panda bear feature on an album with another artist panda bears vocals come through and totally derail whatever vibe the album add going on however that didn't really seem to be the case on this LP I actually think pandas vocals not only were complemented really well at the very spacious music on this track but the way that he sung on the song lended itself well to the vibe that Daft Punk was going for on this album maybe it got a little eccentric as he was climbing up in range ah-ha-ha-ha-ha but still it did not become over bearing good job I love the subtle progression of this track instrumentally it was a nice song to tag on the end of this LP it felt like the slow motion montage soundtrack to an unforgettable night out with your friends now I really dig the disco tracks on this LP I love the slow jams on this LP but this album really dazzles when it comes to the longer more ambitious and more instrumentally fleshed out tracks like Giorgio by Moreau dare to have this dude on this album just shows how far that Thomas and guy man will go to get that authentic sound for this record to really pay homage to the musical eras that they are worshipping I love the students narration on this track his personal story that comes through he is just telling it how it happened and how he sees it and how his life went and what brought him to this point and the music is incredibly epic against his vocals the sequence synthesizers which really create a saga of sound the song sounds a little cheesy at first but there's an incredible energy to it as it progresses the song eventually turns into what I think is kind of a synth lead progressive rock jam it's incredibly ambitious especially as strings come in through on the latter half of the track and really fill the song out beautifully and the very dramatic song touch on this album which totally makes sense if you take a look at Paul Williams career writing songs for his singers writing songs for television writing songs for soundtracks I love the opening of this track Paul's voice sounds fantastic emotive as hell the song picks up steam eventually going into a string of very funky disco grooves that are incredibly again smooth and then on the latter portion of this thing it slows down and brings in a huge chorus again Daft Punk going for that epic musical accompaniment and some of the things that Paul is singing on this track about touching feeling being convinced that he's he's real almost it's like Daft Punk is bringing lyrics that sort of toy with the idea of being a human having feelings or being a robot and and what it means to kind of cross those planes to me the song is rock opera s maybe something meatloaf fans can really appreciate and there few other tracks on here which are very instrumentally impressive too like the track motherboard which to me isn't one of my favorite songs on this LP I think the composition the structure of this song could have been a little bit more interesting but the woodwind on this track the pace of it is very tense and it's again Daft Punk flexing that instrumental muscle and the closing track on this thing contact epic epic finish it gets so intense so distorted so heavy it really finishes this album off with a bang overall God's a incredibly impressed with this album not only did Daft Punk recapture all these old musical styles redo a lot of them with a new modern flair and kind of their own twist on it mix them all together onto this one LP where they all have a lot of different qualities to them stylistically because the duo covers a lot of different genres on this thing not just a handful and they have an incredible flow to them from beginning to end on this LP sure there are a few tracks on here that sort of paled in comparison to others but even though Daft Punk isn't pioneering into some kind of new electronic music territory what makes this album so amazing to me is that it is a tribute a tribute to music and it's a passionate well produced and well performed one at that I'm feeling 80 on the cell peak if you've given it a listen what did you think of it love it hate it why that's it this review was my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw want to give a shout-out to Dodie Bob Tammy Timothy and Big Joe only the strong subscribe and all mistakes were

Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sleep album and the sciences this is a surprise new album from one of stoner metals most important bands if not the most important band sleep sleep is of course a trio featuring al Sisneros on bass and vocals Matt Pike on guitar and now jason roeder of neurosis Fame on drums through the 90s and the 2000s sleeps musical track record might not have exactly been prolific but what little music they did release caused a heavy and druggie underground surge in the rock genre that we are still feeling to this day repeatedly on record after record the band's slow fuzzy riffs built up into these massive mountains of droney psychedelic goodness but the band's key members eventually split off into their own respective bands high on fire and owned and while in a way it sucked to not have new music from sleep every once in a while what few records they did release each seemed like its own pivotal addition to the stoner metal genre plus Madden owls output post sleep has been pretty great too I mean each one in their respective bands has come through with at least a couple of classic records so now we're at a point where it's been 15 years since the release of the last sleep album their biggest dope smoker and of course this new album came out on 4/20 & on Third Man Records of all places third man thank you Jacky boy Jack Thank You Jackman thanks Jackman Thank You Johnny Depp so sleep is back and this record sounds like they haven't even missed a beat while the material on this is similar to that of sleeps other output it's also different at the same time the mix is obviously nowhere near as rough as holy mountains which is pretty notorious for not being the best produced album ever the performances on this record aren't quite as aggressive or animalistic either the sciences is definitely on the more meditative side of the sleep spectrum and yet this record is not nearly as bass heavy or as slowly paced as dope smoker or Jerusalem the sciences hits this kind of successful middle ground between sounding Spacey but also very visceral one has to consider that Matt and Al have had years of artistic progression outside of the sleep bubble and they're kind of each bringing their own experience into this record because there's a really abrasive roar to the tone and Matt's guitars as well as some really aggressive and flashy soloing that wasn't quite as intense as it was on previous sleep records Al's bass work I think has only gotten more simplistic and meditative since his years in ohm and also he kind of brings that monotone deadpan chant like vocal delivery that he kind of honed in that band not the guttural bellowing vocals that one may be used to hearing on sleeps older material so on this record in a way fans can expect to hear elements of ohm high on fire and sleep all at once thankfully no matter whose creative input seems to be taking the reins on a given track it all comes together pretty harmoniously so pretty much every track on this thing save for the tension building intro is a long winding Jami and exciting rock rumination the song marijuana's theme features these righteous galloping riffs and drums that get louder and more intense the track plods along I just love the progressive intensity of the track also Matt Pike rips this amazing like layered guitar solo in the last leg of the song that just overloads my brain it's like great stoner metal it's great stoner rock it just feels like I'm on drugs it's noisy it's overwhelming the song sonic Titan right after is pure thunderous Sabbath worship especially as it transitions into this second track with a groovy ur riff and al pulls out this vocal melody that it's it's just so Ozzy I love the kind of slinky ascending descending riffs they're kind of creepy at this point in the track and we get yet another great guitar solo to finish things off we actually see the return of Al's classic growl on the track Antarctic Ken's thawed antarcticine 's Antarctic uns it's the longest track on this thing at 14 minutes easily one of the most epic the lyrics feature all of this grand imagery of seas and ice and glaciers as one of the more meditative points on the record all I really wish for here is just the the mix had more bass on it because while it's not terrible it's certainly listenable the performance is on this thing are great it just feels a little too hollow or maybe even slightly tinny for a stone or metal record sometimes we have even more Sabbath worship on this record on the track Giza Butler a tribute to the band star bassist opening up with a very pensive psychedelic guitar intro the vocals are somewhat stiff stiffer than they are on the rest of the record in my opinion which is something that has kind of turned me off about some ohm albums a while I think it goes over somewhat well on a majority of the tracks here and on this song not so much and given that it is a butler tribute track I guess I was expecting a little bit more bass work to kind of come to the forefront here I mean there is a solo a bass solo on the tail end of the song but I don't really care for the tone of the bass at all again felt a little hollow and even though I feel like this track might be a little bit of a low point on the album it's all relative I mean in the grander scheme of things it's still pretty enjoyable and then we have the botanist closing things up on this album which is a very kind of moody very dynamic track takes things in a direction with these sparkling spacious guitars that kind of remind me of some of the ballads on Metallica's black album I mean sleep ain't right in a ballad or anything like that but it's a pretty good tune and I think a thoughtful emotive way to end this album - and that's pretty much the record from front to back I mean it's it's really good easily one of the better and more consistent comeback albums to come out in a while a record that shows a band doing what they're known for doing what they've done and doing it incredibly well showing that they still have it it's not so different that it's reinventing the wheel or anything like that or doing anything truly groundbreaking for the genre but the band still did a really excellent job of writing new material staying true to their sound while also incorporating the various musical worlds that each person on this album has been living in for the past 10 to 15 years I'm feeling a strong a - a light 9 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new tobacco record ultimate ooh massage this is the third full-length solo effort from multi-instrumentalist and black moth super rainbow frontman tobacco aka Tom Beck now under the name tobacco Tom has consistently put out material that doesn't sound too unlike what he already does in black moths super rainbow a band whose music is pretty video syncretic and unique but personally I find the musical the compositional component of their songs to be a little shallow at times that can depend on which black moth super rainbow album you're listening to and if you're at all bothered by a really simple melodic approach but black Mouth super rainbow sounds still is is undeniably unique I know a black moth super rainbow song when I'm hearing it I know what I'm hearing they're very trademark specific brand of electronically tinged psychedelic pop fronted with all these whisper quiet vocoder vocals and basic drum machine rhythms that are fed through this really distorted low Phi fuzzy production style along with keyboards guitars some bass it's really dirty it's grimy it's trippy purposefully aged I think black moths super rainbow takes a lot of production cues away from musical projects like Boards of Canada but I think they take that influence and do something much more fun and playful with it now like I said a lot of these same qualities that are in black moths super rainbows music they carry over into tobacco but there are some pretty strong differences for one especially with the debut tobacco record there's an overtly strong instrumental hip-hop vibe on this record however that has been fading away since tobacco first came out with that debut record and here on this new album it seems like it's completely dissipated I think ultimate to massage is the most experimental abrasive noisiest hell thing that tobacco Tom feck even in black Mouth super rainbow has put out thus far but typically fuzzy production you find on Tom's projects is much more to struck on this record some of the instrumentation on this thing literally disintegrates into Distortion just vanishes four little tiny spare seconds of time some tracks on here like blow your heart come through these early bombastic beats and there are a handful of songs on here that are very chilly and apocalyptic and depressing in tone as well and some of the more upbeat tracks on this thing are sonically dense either because of all the effects laid into these sounds or because tom is just layering more synthesizer into these tracks whether it be chords just droning in the background or arpeggios or really bright melodic leads it's like every song here is a little tiny psychedelic pill which you take and each comes with its own trip some are nightmarish and horrifying and unsettling others are very fun and sweet or calming and blissful it's like I'm being transported to a different world where everything that I assumed and thought I understood sonically is just flipped on its head everything's melting everything's neon colored and sugar-coated not only does tobacco do a better job of bringing sonic diversity onto this LP but I think he digs for more interesting sounds as well I get that sensation right from the start of this LP with the song streaker which has these unsettling screams these broken cymbals this very Spacey sort of off-kilter beat that feels like it has a very loose grip of the tempo there are these sluggish since sequences playing throughout the song they're very woozy and then to top it all off this vocoder vocal that is just so guttural and low and deep and monstrous I feel like I'm listening to a satanic transformer try to sing me a song I've never heard tobacco this twisted he is just abusing sound on this record and it's beautiful it's just enjoyably warped and there are other songs on here that fit that description as well like with the song face breakout which has these very off beat drums these lead vocals that don't really feel like they're on the tempo either and are just whispering out out out out but these really loose verses are matched with a beautiful tight and just lush instrumental chorus that has all these synth layers in it they're so blissful they're so glassy so just I just want to lick them and then there's omen classic another incredibly warped track on this LP where the vocals just swallowed and what seems like maybe a low-pass filter but there's a lot of over modulated bass on this track as well so the song just feels really thick and just reverberating and then there's a song blow your heart which feels like this fuzzy just distorted aggressive robot Punk song like I'm listening to the world as it were if our robot overlords came down and destroyed the human race but somehow in the process got into our drug stash and became addicted to psychedelics and this is what they be doing all day just making music like this and these abrasive strange hard-hitting moments are not only great but they make the sweeter more serene spots on this record really stand out because they bring a good counterpoint to it like the song creaming for beginners which feels like a mind-altering lullaby then there's 13 pools City McKnight Road and father sister Berserker two of the more compositionally ambitious tracks on this LP I think these are the two most impressively put together tobacco songs not only in just the entire record here but into that goes entire discography blackbaud super rainbow including that to the song father sisters also matched with this grand sweeping melody that plays throughout some parts of the track that reminds me a little bit of Frank Zappa speeches and regalia now there are some downsides to this LP in my opinion for one it just feels like a mixed bag of tracks a lot of these songs are very short they're kind of brief like I said they're short colorful strange trips but it is still a very good collection of these very short strange trips there are some tracks on here that have a lyrical component like eruption which is completely asinine and then there is a song or two on here like the second track on here which do run a little redundant and mundane but still having said all that I still think this is one of the more creative records I've come across this year one of the more sonically engaging and interesting records I've heard this year just so overwhelmingly colorful and noisy and fun some fun beats some fun melodies on this thing I just loved Jers Bravo to tobacco I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is it my friends my needle drops Anthony Fantana tobacco's smacko forever "},{"id":"WY1cW0FZxm0","title":"Jeff Rosenstock - Post- ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"hi everyone wreaths Annie Greta no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jeff Rossen stock album post New York singer-songwriter Jeff Rosenstock wants the frontman for the band bomb the music industry contemporary punk band that had some decent records in the 2000s wasn't crazy about them myself but that is partially why when Jeff went solo I was not so intrigued not so sitting on the edge of my seat to hear that however I feel like you really kind of came through and wowed me in this solo capacity especially when he broke through with records like we cool that was in 2012 not only was there a punk-rock aesthetic on this record but also a power pop one too like Jeff's songwriting really shined through this punk rock sound with these really memorable kind of funny self effacing songs that were really catchy and thymic and and kind of revealing two toward Jeff's character getting down right to the Nitty Gritty of his emotional problems and anxiety and neuroses now I just follow up album worried the lyrics got a bit more political the production got a little bit rougher and the overall flow of the album was a bit more seamless almost like I was listening to a some kind of punk rock opus or concept record and Jeff is essentially striking while the iron is hot following that record up with this new album over here just over a year later he also recently hit fans up with that dramamine single back in 2017 but again here we now have post this is ten tracks forty minutes and it contains material that almost feels like a little bit of a reiteration of Jeff's last album worried which is not necessarily a bad thing in a lot of ways worried is his best record yet he is a very compelling singer and songwriter he displays a great amount of conviction in his songs but also he's very good at playing this dejected sad-sack angle that kind of reminds you of who the big boys are and who the pretenders are who don't really kind of have that emotionally cutting delivery or writing style and instead just trying to force an emotional reaction out of their audience Jeff's music and writing just has this power behind it in my opinion that that kind of makes the individual listening feel small and reminds them makes them conscious of the fact that they're kind of being ground up in modern societies gears and that is the case with this new record over here especially when Jeff is kind of building on a lot of what he did on worry with longer more massive more gargantuan and epic songs the song USA is a prime example of that at 7 minutes long and undergoes multiple shifts in these epic musical punk rock passages lyrically Jeff kind of flips through all of these pictures of I guess his emotional numbness toward American culture some cashier like a corner store or something giggling and a dad driving badly and in a crossover with his family all this builds up to this amazing huge powerful refrain of we're tired wet bar that really just kind of takes all the pent-up anger and the the aggravation of everything jeff has been singing about up until that point just out into full throttle the song let them win is similarly anthemic and fed up there is a huge power struggle theme going on in this track the song builds up into this massive whoa-ohh-ohh chorus and eventually kind of coasts out into this very beautiful serene ambient drone that pretty much sees the album out another songwriting highlight that stuck out for me had to be 9 out of 10 which didn't stick with me because it's as big and as epic as some of the other tracks on this record rather it's a very sad modest song with antisocial lyrics and a very sad tune and listening to this track I can't help but literally envision Jeff Rosenstock just stoned and bummed out on the subway the issue I have with a good deal of this record though is that its tunes and it's slightly sloppy performances aren't quite as exciting and as up to snuff as they were on worried and even when they are it just kind of feels like Jeff is going through the motions or this is just kind of like an average moment for him I would say the overall quality of this record is is almost on par with we cool it's kind of almost there but is there a track on this thing among the two to three-minute cuts that is as catchy and smart and novel as hey Alison or hall-of-fame or especially nausea mmm the closest I think Jeff comes to doing that on this record is the dreary alt rock ballad TV stars TV star don't care about who you are yeah I mean honestly they probably don't celebrities probably don't really care about you yet we are so infatuated with them like something to consider as we yet again float the idea of electing another celebrity president come on guys come on but honestly a lot of the faster harder punchy or cuts on here while they are decent they just kind of run as like a blur for me beating my head against a wall has to be one of Jeff's most insipid songs yet like not really his most inspired writing especially from a lyrical standpoint I feel like tracks like Melba powerlessness your throat also black a certain kind of stickiness and excitement for Jeff Jeff solo discography isn't even that vast right now and yet he somehow hit this peak of predictability with these several tracks I wouldn't say they're terrible songs though still listenable still somewhat enjoyable there's just not a whole lot about this record that's making me want to come back to the entire thing you know there are a couple tracks that felt really epic really ambitious some of Jeff's best material yet a couple songs that really pulled at my heartstrings but outside of that much of the album just came off average to me you know the record is likeable but it doesn't stand out outside of a few cuts I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing Trey mmm have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would

ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new no worries album yes loud no worries is a collaborative duo featuring singer-songwriter Anderson Pak and producer knowledge who had a pretty decent EP come out lately late last year like just on the border of 2016 which was a pretty cool blend of hip hop and soul although there weren't that many tracks on this thing and they felt kind of rough and loose in structure so that they didn't really add up too much for me other than just like a very sweet Pleasant vibe but now that the whole record is out I think the collaboration has proven itself to be pretty fruitful what about us Anthony is our collaboration fruity info first let me start by saying that Stones Throw Records perfect label for this album not only because of knowledge is very jazzy textured production I know he's dropped music on the label before but the thing is that sound it really was within the wheelhouse of this label you can tell that his music directly descends from artists like mad lib and J Dilla almost to a fault though because his last record in my opinion really Wirtz influences on its sleeve but teaming up with Anderson PAC on this thing they really create a vibe sound all their own now Anderson PAC I really liked his last album I wasn't crazy for it wasn't head over heels for it I thought it was a little overly long and and his versatility almost worked against him to the point where he was doing so many things on this record he just couldn't focus or concentrate on one single idea for too long yes allowed however comes off way more focused and cohesive and sexy God is it sexy and raunchy and melodic and hypnotic although a lot of the tracks on this thing they follow a pretty loose structure they almost feel like extended odds and ends in a way or just short musical moments that have been looped and stretched out to the point where they feel like full songs or maybe half songs which is why as an EP these tracks didn't really make too much sense to me but as an album even though a lot of the tracks on this thing don't really have strong endings or all that much structure to them they do still reinforce one another's vibe pretty well the sensuality adds up the charisma adds up the swagger adds up in a way this thing is like neo Souls answer to mad villainy there are loads of weird obscure vocal snippets throughout this thing which are used to set the tone of a track or enhance the narrative or even just be funny like on intro cut on this thing or on the closer fuck you which involves a weird long story which at one point features flammable piss for real flame flammable piss a lot of the beats on this thing are pretty simple it's a lot of repetitive jazzy soulful loops not a whole lot of change ups but I guess this does leave space very open space for Anderson PAC to deliver these incredible vocal performances whether it be some very funny or just entertaining spoken word some silky vocal harmonies and of course that fiery raspy passionate lead vocal that you probably already know by now given his past features given his past records and there are lots of highlights in the tracklist the song swayed and linked up even though these tracks precede the release of this album they fit snugly within the tracklist and they still sound great song wings is this low-key alluring ballad where Anderson hangs in his lower register quite a bit and while the music is sweet the lyrics are pretty salty pretty bitter one moment where he's like demanding that this girl get her shit together another moment on this record where he is singing about how this girl she's a nasty girl and if he didn't tell her someone else would have let's just say the lyrics on this thing feel like they come from an era of soul where a James Brown's it's a man's man's man's world was popular but way nastier and meaner and actually sexier too so much though that it almost doesn't feel right listening to this thing and just not having sex while it's on especially when songs like best one are on which is specifically about a relationship where these two are loving and they're fucking like what they have together is just going to completely dissolve into thin air tomorrow the smooth 80s R&B groove of the song scared money the hypnotic groove and hook on just lack this is a fantastic highlight to the intro on the song get bigger is amazing as well listen there are a lot of moments on this album that I think are really good but at the end of the day they're kinda just moments nothing really feels as developed as it could be as finely tuned as it could be these highlight tracks kind of stand shoulder to shoulder with filler cuts in the track lifting - they really don't feel that much different in terms of the way they're structured the only way I'm able to really decipher that they're filler cuts is that Andersson delivers a less interesting vocal performance on the record or the song is mostly dominated by a vocal snippet or a sample of some sort like on Cutlass or khadija or can't stop the writing on this thing is just kind of basic but I will say that doesn't necessarily ruin the entire album because knowledge and Andersen have so much raw talent together in this collaboration that they can fuel an album just on this idea of capturing lightning in a bottle even though in a lot of ways this album feels like a free-flowing collaboration with no limitations they came through with more highlights than lowlights I just wish the two of them had incorporated a bit more structure into these tracks and cut the tracklist down to the best songs instead of giving us just $19 aft s-- feeling a light - decent seven on this record transition what did you think of this no worries album did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best one should I review next hit

"},{"id":"1K6l7wIuOHg","title":"Wiley - Godfather II ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone nuclear deal here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Wiley album Godfather - Wiley is a UK grime legend guy who's been in the game for a while now I covered his last full length album Godfather last year he has a very long and storied career and the grime scene over there this decade has been a pretty fruitful one for Wiley he's been dropping a lot of records many of which have been independently released he's finally been getting a lot of recognition in the hip-hop scene over here in America he's had one relatively solid album after the next and he kind of topped it all off and away with godfather last year a record that was not only lengthy and epic by grime standards but a record that also celebrated Grimes culture and history as a genre as well as Wiley's role within it as one of its bigger artists there were tons of bangers on this record lots of interesting features and verses great production so given everything I liked about this record of course I was looking forward to hearing Godfather - what I assumed was essentially going to be a second helping may be an extension of the narrative as it were but after a handful listens to this thing I'm just having like a bit of a head-scratcher because I'm not really seeing how Godfather 2 is really the lyrical The Musical or even the spiritual successor to the original Godfather I mean it certainly starts that way with a handful of pretty mild bangers many of which sound like they could have slipped into Godfather's tracklist and sounded pretty snug they're pretty at home like the song been a while which features an instrumental that has a lot of big drums rattling high hats huge grand orchestral hits eerie synthesizers as well as Wiley's trademark staccato flows with tons of rhymes about bars and vibes his vet status and his experience in the grime scene the song I call the shots is a little bit more strange instrumentally but still very fulfilling still very visceral it's some cold-blooded boss  also makes a very smart lyrical reference to these genres of music that that are inspiring this style with Wiley talking about jungle and grime being fuse like a mixture of boxing and may again a pretty solid and enjoyable track even with lyrics on this thing like BBK is the squad without us things would be odd the song bar features an instrumental with lots of aggressive bass and whooshing synthesizers kind of sounds like it's touching down on some of the musical roots of dubstep in the UK I'm sure I'll get a lot of angry comments in the comments section if I'm somehow off with that lineage and the song remember me even though it's not the most fantastic lyrically it still has a pretty sharp sung hook but again outside of these tracks it's kind of hard to see this album's connections to the original Godfather project because it's just 36 minutes long features a fraction of the songs the rest of the tracks on here are nowhere near as gritty as the bulk of the material on godfather as a lot of the tracks here just kind of seem like a fusion of pop and grime pop rap with a lot of simple love songs to this record I don't really see as being a celebration of Grimes roots that its predecessor was either not to mention some of the lyrics on this thing are far worse than that of a lot of what was on godfather some like vodka or lemonade some like tonic and gin and of course that's repeated twice for some reason even though the structure doesn't really call for it my ringers been off for years because I don't want to hear it Rea if I hear my jam in a dance I put my hands in the air and sing and on this very same track while he drops a bar about doing things not to be on trend and he's not trying to be trendy and so on and so forth even though Godfather two easily has some of his trendiest tracks ever especially when Wiley drops that auto tune sung hook on the next track all the time you can't tell me that with this awfully sung hook he's not trying to be trendy there's even a bar on the track still standing where he's talking about oh I was chasing a check at one point in my career but now I'm chasing art even though this and a lot of other tracks on here are like some of his least artful what is happening on the song over it on this album it just sort of sounds like you're on this moody introspective Drake thing on a sad dance hall beat if that's not trendy I don't know what is there's some kind of awkward features on here too like Maurice more on the same song still standing his performance is noticeably less smooth than that of pretty much everyone else on this thing just generally the guest singers on things seem as generic as possible to appeal to as wide and as pop centric and audience as possible I mean I do appreciate the flow of the tracklist kind of getting a little bit more romantic and personal and introspective and moody as the album goes along which might make it a more digestible listen for people who are so much into grime or like a little bit more pop rap in their life or who live for the prevailing trends that Wiley works into this record but it just seems like going into this project there wasn't much of a question as to whether or not these songs are memorable are they well-written do they actually play to Wiley strengths mostly the answer to that is no a big fat no and as a result this album is really just a mixed bag I'm feeling a strong four to a late five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your tire of you next hit the like if you like

intro still what still oh-oh-oh-oh I'm getting real good at sweating my needle drops it's time for a review the Smashing Pumpkins Oceania this is the ninth studio LP from famed alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins a band who really made their mark on the 1990s with some of the most critically acclaimed albums to come out of that decade the very rough and psychedelic Gish the catchy ER and had more refined Siamese Dream the epic ambitious double album Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness as well as the not as hot but more goth tinged adore which brought a little bit more electronics into the fold too with the pumpkins music these guys had their lineup changes over the course of their career and they were on a serious streak up until about the 2000s they kind of opened up the millennium with what was supposed to be their last record machina a concept album that was kind of a decent return to their alt rock sound considering that adore definitely left them in a different spot when fans had last heard a studio album from them in the early 2000s death was definitely knocking on the Smashing Pumpkins doorstep and they just kind of called it quits and then after years of side projects solo efforts in 2007 the Smashing Pumpkins decided to get back together with a different lineup Billy Corrigan was there Jimmy Chamberlin was back on drums and the band kind of seemed to return where where they left off with a new album titled zeitgeist and when I say left off I mean we're mocking a left off which had its its pros and it's cons there were definitely some moments on this LP that felt especially heavy but the lyrics left a lot to be desired even though they were kind of taking a surprisingly political shift in in message the guitars are so loud but so just like muddy and and hearing guitars recorded like that is like drinking sour milk Jimmy Chamberlain's drums are just stashed all the way in the back could barely really make out a lot of the subtleties however Billy Corgan has not given up in refining the pumpkins sound in this phase of their career and recently he's been putting out material as the Smashing Pumpkins with a new lineup and sort of working on this project called tear garden by kaleidoscope where the pumpkins are kind of putting out songs one by one in small bits and then releasing them as EPS as time moves on but oceania has kind of interrupted the flow of that project in a way maybe I guess it's supposed to be a part of that series however it's really no secret that the Smashing Pumpkins were not getting all that much attention or success from this new one by one song release format so now we're back to an album format 13 songs in one big bunch and while the Smashing Pumpkins stylistically are not really at the forefront of much of anything anymore they just sound good on this LP they avoid a lot of the older guitar tones and some of the older riffs something I don't really feel like they tried to do all that much on zeitgeist which in addition to all the other issues made it sound dated though slightly I would say it's a loss of their trademark sound this is kind of how you want the Smashing Pumpkins to feel in 2012 now I'm sure there are fans on the internet that praising this record simply because the band has managed to put out a better album than zeitgeist and for sure that has happened but I would argue that you know this album does function beyond that that the songs on this thing bring a mix of both heavy and delicate moments it's multifaceted dimensional just like you would want to Smashing Pumpkins album to be but I do feel like one side of the cell peak goes over better than the other the Achilles heel for me on Oceania are the louder tracks like the opening track on this thing quasar it actually made me want to just turn the album off right from the start though I think it is the loudest riff on this LP it's incredibly tame and just proof that the Smashing Pumpkins are just nowhere near as ferocious as they used to be I feel the same way about the next track on this LP panopticon but I do feel like it goes down easier because it is a more melodic track and focuses on Billy Corian songwriting a bit more as opposed to just rock plus the track features all these very rich just beautiful harmonized guitar leads that that pop up on quite a few tracks on here which really bring a very bright quality to this album and then just Smashing Pumpkins sound and aesthetic on this LP in general though there are still those moody spots that you would expect from a Pumpkins album this thing is definitely feeling like a bright blue sky totally cloud lifts sun is shining air is warm there's a light breeze kind of like that it's like a brand-new day those harmonized guitar leads get really hyped up and played at a faster tempo on the track chimera toward the end of this album and they get played so fast in just such a lively way that it feels like the Smashing Pumpkins are kind of playing pop punk like I said just a lot of louder spots on here feel either just weak or a little too where I think this LP gets great are the quieter moments that's where Billy Corgan songwriting really stands out and you start getting those beautiful just breathtaking symphonic rock tracks that call back to some of the best moments on melancholy songs like the celestials violet rays my love is winter one diamond one heart those songs are all next to each other and they're really quite the streak on this LP lots of moody hooks that just burst with heavy guitars and synthesizers lots of melody Billy's voice sounds great the acoustic break on my love is winter freakin rules and sadly after that I kind of feel like this LP falls apart on the title track oceania Billy Corgan songwriting is is great there's a lot of changes in instrumentation but then they try to drag it out to nine minutes and kind of fall short in the process there's a nice acoustic breakdown but then it morphs into this synth rock part that doesn't really go anywhere just kind of vows out fades out before anything interesting really happens it's really a letdown it's kind of like being kicked out of a party after the title track on here I have a hard time describing a lot of the songs on this LP because I feel like they are so nondescript their songs on here that definitely kind of feel like revamped versions of songs that have already been on smash pumpkins albums but are kind of performed with this brighter richer sound that the Smashing Pumpkins are working with right now songs like pale horse and an inkless for sure the final track on this LP is very pretty song it's it's a decent closer and overall I just kind of come away from this album feeling like I said I just heard a brighter more modernized version of the Smashing Pumpkins that I'm used to there are points at this LP that do feel a bit complacent like Billy Corrigan is is a little too intent on kind of serving up the same old Smashing Pumpkins sound but just altered ever so slightly and while that has made this album enjoyable for me it really hasn't turned into love I guess all the way through because there are spots on here that do kind of feel like a formulaic bore I'm kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this album which I know you know doesn't seem like that amazing but I'm actually pretty happy about it considering I thought I was going to go into this album hating it so it was pretty nice for to just kind of turn around on me actually surprise me with some very enjoyable songs that make me look forward to the next Smashing Pumpkins release so what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next and what do you think of the Smashing Pumpkins at this point in their career and Billy carrying on the name and and all that jazz hmm let me know Anthony Fantana the Smashing Pumpkins "},{"id":"SipouoqLyxM","title":"Charli XCX - Pop 2 MIXTAPE REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hey everyone blow that in the nose no here the Internet's busiest music nerd well really the Internet's stuffiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new Charli XCX mixtape pop - Charli XCX futuristic pop diva hailing from the UK whose work I have warmed up to quite a bit lately since she made the very essential shift from run-of-the-mill pop run off to freaky electro pop in left field bubblegum base she dropped two mixtapes in this vein in 2017 the first of which was number one angel and pop 2 is the second and once again Charli XCX is teaming up with a lot of producers from the PC music camp the likes of easy fun Sophie Agee cook so the sound of this thing is almost guaranteed to take the shape of pop to come and it's kind of easier than ever to make that leap given just how accessible and an almost present day a lot of the material on this new tape is it's like we're seeing the slightly experimental and not so distant future as opposed to the the the weird wild and freaky my head hurts I have a headache the weird wild and freaky tone of pop that we might be hearing like a generation down the road so while this tape isn't quite as out there as number one angel nor is it as bordering on avant-garde as her vroom-vroom EP was EP of the year EP in a freaking year Charlie just continues on this trend of dishing out very inventive contemporary pop music with just wall-to-wall features the only moments when the album falters in my opinion are twofold one when a featured guest kind of just causes a lull and a track because they're not that interesting sort of like Tommy cash on the song delicious just not really seeing the appeal of his performance here the vocals are kind of generic and the sudden stop and transition into something entirely different in the midst of this feature leads me to believe that that may be there you know there wasn't really that much to it and while we're on the topic of underwhelming features jay Park is maybe one of the most generic pop rap performances that I've heard this year and number two I guess there are some moments on here where I feel like the production falters a little bit as well like on the song backseat featuring Carly Rae Jepsen I do love Carly's performance on this track her and Charlie match each other very well and it was really appropriate putting her on this song because there's a bit of a slow-mo glistening glamorous 80's aesthetic to it however the very molasses-like pacing of the track and the roaring bass and the kind of very jagged synthesizers that close the track out are really noisy unnecessarily messy you just feel kind of like cluttered not really the payoff I would have wanted given how slow and how patient much of the track is these song tears is similarly cluttered to my ears as much as I do love the inclusion of what sounds like these very odd squeaky screams throughout the track that that were really unexpected but exhilarating all the same while the song out of my head does kind of sound like a very standard dance or electro pop track definitely one of the more commercial cuts that I've heard Charlie put out in a while not really anything too experimental about it the hook is just too sticky to deny also some of the very lewd and somewhat gritty and self-effacing lyrics that Charlie brings to the table definitely bring a tone different than that of your average pop song and even tuflow one of the most average performers and singers and contemporary pop couldn't even ruin this track now there are some bangers in the tracklist here that I loved quite a bit and they take things down a slightly weirder territory like I got it featuring Brooke candy and cupcake I love the quiet aggression of this track I like the really odd sputtering very spastic groove I love how Brooke candies feature is so much quieter and has this very subtle tension to it meanwhile when cupcake is introduced on the track the volume just pumps up so much attitude and this track just kind of takes me back to the hardest and the craziest and the most off-the-wall moments of the vroom-vroom EP and the song FEM ba is one of many moments on here but maybe the most prominent one where Charlie seems to fuse this idea of the digital world and the romance world being human but also kind of being a digital representation of yourself or like a cybernetic being talking about this infatuation or love that she has for this other person making her short-circuit again and one of many cuts lately where you have singers pop singers addressing love in the internet and the information age and the technology age and this you know just throw it on the pile of the many songs in this vein that I enjoy but really for me the selling point of this track is the punchy beats the very nimble and kind of jumpy and manipulated vocal lines from Charli XCX and the fantastic miki blanco feature which is absolutely gnarly their cuts that take a slower more ballad like tone like lucky or the first leg of the song track 10 both of which allow me both of which are incredibly sensual especially Lucky's lead vocal as it ascends into these like distorted kind of weird manipulated falsettos another moment on this record where I feel like Charlie is almost kind of morphing into a moment where she's part human also part computer like she's just a digital embodiment of a woman who was just crying out into the night overall this is a very enjoyable mixtape for me at the end of the day there were some tracks that I don't think quite hit the mark mark mark mark II but I'm still enjoying hearing Charlie work with the PC music camp I'm still enjoying what she's doing with her sound on these records but I can't help but feel like we haven't quite heard Charlie XCX with this sound fully realized yet like we have something bigger and better and more ambitious and more gargantuan coming down the pipe so while I am crossing my fingers for that I am still enjoying pop - as is I'm feeling a like two decent seven on this thing Tran I transition so I hope you heard this tape I hope you enjoyed it let me know what you thought of it down in the comments over here next to my head is a another Charlie XCX review that you can check out and that's uh that's it guys I'll see you in the next video

nerd and it's time for review of the new drench album undertow drench is a UK rock duo this is their second full-length LP I caught wind of them earlier this year off of a few hot singles namely the song we can do what we want easily one of the better rock tunes of the year it's wild it's fun it's sweaty it's wordy it's got a punk vibe to a bit of a rockabilly vibe coming from the lead guitar that intros the song songs wall vocals on the tracker a little obscured by some low mixing and some reverb but they still sound pretty good the guitars and drums come together on this track and create a very visceral performance and there is just a million-dollar hook on this track as well we can do there is a very dark tense bridge on this track too with an awesome build-up to a final climax for the song it's very well put together track but unfortunately this is one of those albums where the deeper cuts just don't measure up to the lead single I found a lot of the tracks on this album to be just far less fulfilling we can do what we want is to me such a direct bold memorable in-your-face song so it's kind of weird to hear the rest of this album suffer from like a musical identity crisis the other cuts on this LP just kind of feel like these basic rehashes of various underground rock styles with kind of nondescript songs fueling them like the song the snake which is just 100% pure Nirvana worship from beginning to end or the song side by side which oddly enough feels like I'm listening to Michael Stipe sing with some echo drenched vocals on top of a kind of watered-down Jesus and Mary Chain instrumental with a very foreign mystical sinister lead melody and the title track here it's a bit of instrumental filler maybe kind of heavy and it may have some nice tremolo guitars laced in to the instrumental but there's not really much to it in terms of excitement or I guess I guess structure it just feels kind of um I don't know it's a little uneventful and just like it's kind of killing time there are two other tracks in the track listing here that caught my ear though for a good reason the song the woods and standing in the cold both of which are kind of slow dreary deep-voiced post-punk with kind of a gothic flair to them very heavy on the eyeliner with these tracks and these songs are actually one of the better directions that the album goes in not just because I think that drenched ooh the style well but also the tunes underneath these songs are actually two of the better written songs on the album especially the woods which actually feature some incredibly dark imagery in the lyrics of being nailed to a tree to a degree there are two somewhat newer underground bands that already kind of remind me of what dredge is doing maybe a bit of grave babies or crystal stilts groups that pull from a lot of the same stylistic influences garage rock post-punk shoegaze some goth rock similarly they are amalgams of all these different underground styles but in the case of Krystal stilts or grave babies they actually come through with a definitive sound that is instantly recognizable I know when I'm listening to those groups or when I have stumbled across a song from one of those groups I can't say the same for drench rather than forging a distinct sound that they can kind of carry out from the beginning to the end of an LP listening to this album is kind of like watching dreads just sit very uncomfortably in a chair they're just constantly switching position just very fidgety kind of unfocused and focus is something that for me is hard to come by on this album especially as drange on a lot of these tracks exposed themselves as being reverb addicted like many young underground bands out there right now who are essentially using the effect to either I don't know mask a lack of ideas or just make a song feel or sound bigger when what's really opening is these song is getting washed out and the bite of your performance is just being pulled away I wouldn't say there's anything particularly god-awful about this album there are certainly at least a handful of highlights here but much of this album there's not really anything all that memorable about it in my opinion there's nothing about this record that really goes above and beyond in terms of songwriting vocal delivery the playing and the performances the technical ability as well as just the the energy and the intensity they're just too many mild tracks on this record for it to be stand out for me drench has certainly proven with this album that they can make a bigger sound bigger and more I guess intricate and layered than their last album and they certainly have shown that they have the basics of a rock album down but can they move beyond that I'm feeling a strong 5 to light 6 on this album transition if you giving this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what did you think I should rub you nuts and that's it Anthony Fantino drench undertow forever "},{"id":"Zr4YJIqx31c","title":"Future Islands - Singles ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new future islands record singles Maryland via North Carolina's synth pop outfit future Islands has come out with their fourth full-length record whoo I have been a follower of their exploits for a while now ever since I heard some of the more popular cuts off of their 2010 album in the evening air songs like tin man and welcome through that duel and on this record and the band's next record as well I found some really simple straightforward sort of bare-bones drum machine backed synth-pop that made up for its simplicity with some very solid good song writing strong melodies and the incredible vocals of frontman Samuel T herring which have kind of been a selling point for the band lately ever since they did a surprise Letterman performance a few weeks ago what was jaw-dropping about this late-night performance was the level of intensity that the band especially Samuel performed with there were plenty of tight dance grooves in the performance rushes of synthesizers as well as Samuel singing over these tracks with his trademark very soulful rasp that went through a range of pitches but the real high notes of this performance are when he sort of pulls into these guttural death growls that really are something different for the genre Sam really does have a set of pipes that could possibly rival that of some of my favorite death metal singers which is a move I suggest the band go into if this whole future islands thing does not pan out either that or dancing anyway with this electrifying performance of the band's lead single from this new record it seemed that a lot of people were kind of finding out about this band for the first time and my faith in them as a band was rekindled a little bit because with each record of theirs that I have been following so far they've always dropped to three or four songs on to it that I loved but then the rest of the record I can kind of take or leave so I was kind of hoping that singles would just push me over the edge into full-on loving a future Islands record from front to back especially with such a lead track off of this thing and an album title that kind of insinuates that maybe every song is going to be as catchy as the next however singles does not really deliver on the level of intensity that people might be expecting from future islands given that they may have seen that letterman performance or have caught a bunch of live dates that the band has performed at recently I mean truth be told their live sets have kind of been notorious for being just a bit more energetic than what they do on record because here with a lot of the tracks I feel like they play it kind of safe instrumentally and vocally while a lot of tracks here are catchy there are really only a few spots where future islands come off as fierce on top of that I feel this record does exemplify an Achilles heel that I think has been following future islands through nearly every record of theirs and that's the production to me a lot of the songs here feature a pretty flat mix of synthesizers drum machines and bass with Sam's vocals sitting atop all of it pretty comfortably nothing sounds too bright I think overall the instrumentation on this thing is a little sapped of color the beats on this record constantly sit on the back burner not even on the back burner but on the back of the back burner I wish they were louder or even just had a crisper tone I wish they were propelling the instrumentation more aggressively especially as these songs explode in two choruses where it seems like it's really only the synthesizers or maybe even some distorted bass that gets louder and I'm not that crazy about some of the synth texture is used on these tracks to like the really squeaky high-pitched tones wailing away in the background of Sun in the morning or some of the watery reverb tones on the song spirit which very messily color the background and I feel like on synth lines like this and others on here too there's a lot to be desired in terms of placement I feel like there's not a whole ton of precision to the way these synths are played and the bass tone leaves a lot to be desired as well it's either this very flat hollow sound or kind of this bland distortion that brings a bit of heaviness when the band's trying to thicken up a chorus occasionally I feel like the instrumentation here shoots for something sort of quaint light a little more spacious reminding me quite a bit of like a beach house record there we are this is especially true of the track like the moon however even though the beach house comparison even though that beach house sound is very apparent it stirs up nowhere near as much emotion for me here as it does here once again on this new record future Islands essentially deliver a record that has a really solid unbreakable chassis and a souped-up engine of great songwriting and really fantastic vocal performances but the body sitting on top of these things is like that of an economy car I actually didn't even start enjoying this LP fully until I listened to it strictly on headphones numerous times because the mix of this album the instrumentation is just not very full it's not very warm and and I felt like the only way to really even give the record a bit of punch or make it seem like it has a bit of punch is to just bring it into a very close intimate setting then I was able to appreciate how good some of the songs on this thing really are even though like I said some of the performances are reserved but that doesn't stop songs like seasons from just being really good no seasons change wonderful track sweetly ringing with synth melodies a very live snare drum with some tambourine mixed in there too and a killer refrain and vocal melody way to know you Sun in the morning as well I mean just really solid song she gives me a daily so and the vocals even though the instrumentation is not that fantastic they continue to be powerful moving very dramatic theatrical doves another great song I love the collective whoo-hoo on the chorus really nice rush of sound with the hook there if there's any way that singles really does live up to its title it is that the record tracklist overall is pretty no BS there are no songs on here that kill the momentum of the record we have one concise succinct verse chorus verse track after another even the slow burners on this LP the ballads don't lose sight of a really straightforward pop appeal one of my favorite slow burners on here song for our grandfathers is not only a sweet song in terms of melody but I think it is the sweetest song on this entire LP in terms of sentiment it's a pretty touching song speaking directly about our elders the influence that they continue to have on us their guidance their guardianship that they have on us possibly beyond the grave again song for song I really dig what future Islands is dishing out and again I mean this band features one of the most interesting vocals in underground or independent whatever you want to call it pop music today it's just that I'm still not very enamored with the sound of their instrumentation and the production they use to present their songs and while I do think this record is an improvement and is much more focused than future Islands last album I'm still not in love with this one I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition what did you think of this thing did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana future Islands forever "},{"id":"p0-ZLyefddQ","title":"Iceage - You're Nothing ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ice age LP yo nothing me no that that wasn't directed at you ice age is a Danish punk rock outfit this is their sophomore LP but not only are they a punk band but in their music they are brought together in this new LP and their debut LP elements of hardcore punk post-punk noise rock and tons of compression on the overall mix of these tracks giving the songs a very kind of heavy Bhoomi quality the band can be pretty Brutus but there are no strangers to detail when you kind of dig deeper beyond the fact that everything is so echoey so distorted so noisy because even though these guys are very loud in a sense they're kind of carrying a depressive torch for groups like Joy Division and other Danish post-punk acts as well like the sods and it's no surprise that these guys are fans as well of groups like death in June of black metal artists as well through these influences these guys take their hopelessness they take their anguish emotions and they get really aggressive with them the band is just as abrasive as they've always been but on this album you're getting a few dance beats there are some group vocals here and there singing low low low low the instrumentation and the production overall is a bit cleaner a little less lo-fi there are some new ideas but what originally has made the Bands music so appealing to some but I would say unappealing to most is still there to the point where there are some tracks on here where I really do kind of feel like there's nothing new to report like the song burning hand or the other track rasas haha to me these tracks are a little maybe middle of the road for Ice Age they're not particularly aggressive or fast or depressive or noisy or anything like that they are passable and they're fine and they feel like they fit within vans typical style but it's not like they do anything new to define it or experiment with it overall they kind of blend into the ferocity of this 28 minute blast that sneaks in just to tick longer than the debut LP aside from those two tracks for me personally there's not any really major downsides for me on this album outside of a very eerie well textured and well put together but kind of ill placed interlude right at the third track on the album which unfortunately kind of cuts off the momentum that the LP has going up to that point thanks to the first two tracks the opener of this album is the song ecstasy and when this song hits if you don't like it I would say just get the hell out and turn back because this song kind of highlights what turns a lot of people off when it comes to Ice Age they're playing can be really really loose and that seems to be the case as the band kind of breaks into this disco dance beat with these sixteenth notes on the high hat with this alternating bass drum in this snare and over this are these tremolo guitars and bass which are just being strung really quickly but not necessarily in tandem with the beat and you know perfect syncopation and it creates this really dense thick wall of guitar noise over this dance beat which I mean to me is wildly catchy and just sort of weird but you know could be kind of I guess needlessly noisy to other people after this the band kind of reveals this looseness to be kind of an act kind of a facade as they quickly shift away from these tremolo guitars to this very fast-paced you know sets Arista and Denon and they totally switch gears go much faster and when the hook breaks in they switch gears yet again and not only change the speed but kind of change the emotion too because it goes from this aggression and it goes from this passion to this you know dark sadness that you know it seems like the singer of the group can't even awake himself from brush up oh god no after this the pummeling and surprisingly clear track coalition comes in a track that I loved earlier this year talked about in a quickie video earlier this year and I was actually surprised to just hear how composed the band felt on this track but just as biting the song in Hayes has these treble e guitars kind of causing a ruckus and the right channel against this relentless punk groove that is enhanced by the band's very boomy sound I love the jumpy kind of erratic melody on the hook and the vocals on this track to me personally are fantastic yeah they're not amazing vocals in the traditional sense but they're so freakin angry their fiery yet apathetic it's like a pissed-off swan song for defeatism for me the biggest surprise on this entire LP is the song morals which actually to me kind of feels like a post-punk prom song and a bit of a piano ballad led by the band's lead singer the drums behind this track kind of hammer away on the snare militaristically and overall the track kind of seems to bring the band into this sort of downtrodden singer/songwriter like state where all I can kind of you know see is like this post-punk prom going on where everybody's sad and breaking up and the punches spike tell the girls mascaras smudged and there's a sense that I get from this song specifically from the lyrics of just kind of personal weakness which is a feeling I get throughout most of the Bands music this band is is far from projecting any kind of emotions or personalities that feel confident or even strong instead it's kind of self-loathing self-deceptive and gain some kind of catharsis and power and strength from that the strength to make the head bashing music that they create kind of like another lyric on this LP where I believe the singer says wounded hearts can fight but it all comes down the same which is I mean an extremely pessimistic state of mind after this track the extremely catchy song awake comes through which has a great guitar melody very lively vocals I would say it's really the most high-spirited song on the entire album and the closing track on this LP is is fantastic as well and has this mantra of you're nothing over the hook kind of you know reminding the listener of the Bands ethos as the album comes to a finish overall I love this LP I feel like it's pretty on par with everything that made the debut album fantastic with a little bit more diversity as a result maybe there were some missteps here and there especially with that interlude but still I thought it was a fantastic album and is definitely going to be on my favorites list toward the end this year I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this LP if you're in the market for some noisy punk music that nihilistic Elise Mears itself in distortion compression just sonic filth then get into this LP if you've given this LP a listen what do you think of it do you love it hated why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana Ice Age forever you [Music] you

going to review that today but instead on track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good we're going to take a look at the new track from Weezer that's the album cover Hugo from lost yeah and Weezer is going into you this time around they are releasing this thing on epitaph records this September not even a year after they put out what R attitude and what I love about Weezer at this point in their career is what it makes them so interesting to me one of the most interesting bands out there they just do not give it about anything they don't give a they'll just do whatever they want do this do that if it's funny do it just spur the moment impulsive who cares just do it I figure that Weezer is going to need some more album cover materials so I please do ask I do ask next time you're putting out an LP or you know next time you're scrambling for something to put on the front of one of these things please use Cal Church esta Cal do you want to be on the front of a Weezer album well if you got a problem with wheezing you should probably get an inhaler a picture of me is not going to do any good I hate culture Chester let's give a listen to this new Weezer single memories well this was a young vibrant rocker it opened up with these string sections I really was not had no clue what was going to happen was very mmm let's just say I was anticipating something that maybe wasn't going to please me all that much because Weezer's newer stuff their more recent stuff has been a little more polished a little too polished in fact for my taste to really wow me to really get me going but this track as soon as the guitars hit as soon as the base hit as soon as the drums hit it had a much more aggressive much more distorted sound than anything that was on ratah to which had some good singles had some decent tracks on it but still had those moments like the collaboration with little Wayne for example that kind of just felt really out of place and just sort of seemed like the band kind of experimenting with their audience experimenting with what they can do on the album as opposed to Weezer making a song to the best of Weezer's abilities and that's what this song kind of acknowledges it kind of feels the same way a lot of old-school Weezer fans do I wish I could go back there to that time I wish I could go back there to all those memories back when all these things were still fresh and not just something that I missed Ouiser brings up things like I miss when Rage Against the Machine used to be actually raging as the machine an audio slave I miss when we would be on tour there all these live show recollections with journalists rivers brings up just the unwanted transition that everybody has to make to being an adult I think a lot of people are saying this kind of sounds like Andrew W K this could be an Andrew W K track but I mostly think that's because of just how relentless the song is in terms of heavy percussion just being ban-ban if you can appreciate a hook if you can appreciate some pop magic then damn this track give a listen to it of course it's not going to blow your mind it's not going to change the way you listen to music but it is a good and enjoyable song man if you're just looking for something light and sweet to put into the T this is it I'm feeling a strong seven on this and this track actually has me looking forward to see what Weezer is going to do on this album I mean come on let's not get too excited let's not freak out Weezer is not going to write another Blue Album they're not going to write another Pinkerton but this thing with the changeover to epitaph with all of the nostalgic desires that are inside of this track we could be in for something that is maybe a little less commercial a little more vulnerable who knows Anthony Fantan oh the needle drop Weezer early forever "},{"id":"Gc0Jpf_25a4","title":"Tim Hecker- Ravedeath, 1972 ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's most ambient drone nerd time for an album review Tim hackers rave death 1972 oh I'm finally getting to this review now because this help you took me a while to digest don't rush me on these things guys Tim Hecker is a Canadian musician whose albums really take long uninterrupted listens to fully appreciate it's not exactly something you listen to on the go not something you put on shuffle in the iPod rave death is an interesting follow-up to this guy's most recent work for me and a return to more of the distorted and dissonant sounds on an LP like mirages because to me and this is just my opinion maybe his stuff on an imaginary country for example was just way too heavenly pleasant-sounding though I'm sure some people seek that out I'm of the opposite so rave death imagine a post-apocalyptic city the buildings are crumbling the landscape is gray everything looks fuzzy and blurred because there's all sorts of dust and just dirtiness hanging in the air there's only one person left on the planet and if you were that person this album would be the deafening silence you would hear for the rest of your life the whole thing front to back is like a barren wasteland of echoes leftover from a society that used to be there there are signs that life was in this spot whether it be the pianos or the organs or the guitar but the lack of structure proves that there's nothing alive to be found it's like the neglect that these sounds endured over the years caused them to sprawl just grow over each other creating this droney soundscape I hear things when I hear this album but I see a lot of things too I just see a lot of vivid vivid imagery it kind of reminds me of that Twilight Zone episode with burgess Meredith when he's trying to read but nobody will let him read and then the bomb drops while he's in a bank and then he finally has time to read and then he breaks his glasses and he can't this sound is what happens this is the sound track to everything that happens to him after the episode fades to black some moments here do feel like they could have gone on longer though to gain more vastness like the opener or analog paralysis 1978 but the three two to three part epochs on this LP make up for that entirely in the fog in the air hatred of music real highlights on this LP and loaded with textures and things that sound like other things that our moments were I'm pretty sure I'm hearing like string sections or voices though it doesn't make any note of that in the liner notes so I'm sure they're not to me the crowning achievement of this album is how Hecker has created something that has a real real appearance of formlessness and that's not easy to do some tracks on here do feel like they have more intent than others like hatred of music part one which escalates beautifully just like too beautiful for words for me but most of the time here you're just kind of staring at endless landscapes lost cities and that can be just as breathtaking as something that has a real real appearance of structure and planning now I'm not going to make the case that this is the most unique LP on the planet there's a lot of stuff out there like this especially if you do research on the label that this came off of cranky so why is Tim Hecker worth your time more than these other people well to me his music when I'm listening to it I don't feel like I'm observing a piece of art on the wall and standing here and just staring I feel like I'm in it I feel like I'm surrounded by it and to me that's kind of what makes the difference call it ambient call it drone call it whatever I'm calling it a light a the pieces on this thing remind me of everything from Eno to the really quiet interludes on let's say a god speed you black Emperor album and I'm sure all of you want to know what Cal thinks of Tim Hecker if you took care of your computer you wouldn't have to worry about hackers and I hate coucher chest up Anthony Fantana Tim Hecker rave death 1972 forever [Music] you "},{"id":"EEY6WYtxZFQ","title":"My Bloody Valentine - MBV ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"[Music] hi everyone Anthony fan Tiano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an extremely anticipated review of the new My Bloody Valentine LP mb v play the beat man play the beat play that beat man why would you play I can't do the review if you don't play them with a list of my favourite albums of 2013 great features fantastic lyricism and stellar production that I have to give detox a strong beefy tip white 2 you got you got a review what you got a duel what were you doing a review of it's like my buddy's Valentine or something oh yeah that old chestnut My Bloody Valentine is an Irish rock band and really one of the leading figures in the genre known as shoegaze which I talked about at great length in a recent classics week when I decided to review my bloody Valentines seminal sophomore album Lovelace Lovelace and My Bloody Valentine in general may not exactly sound like the acid soaked 60s but the sonic experimentation and just the layers of haze on this record can certainly be traced back to there in the same way that the band style on Lovelace can be traced back to my bloody Valentines early releases because My Bloody Valentine certainly did have humbler beginnings on their earlier EPS which were a lot more lo-fi may be simpler post-punk year so when it comes to the sound of Lovelace My Bloody Valentine really built up to this album I mean they sort of walked up a series of musical steps to get here to this LP that very often people kind of put up on this pedestal far away from not only every other group in this genre of music but my bloody Valentines discography in general and that kind of blind love and obsession with an album can be kind of a blessing and a curse I mean for one it has made music fans 20 years after the release of Lovelace still interested in the idea of a new My Bloody Valentine out it's as if this 20-year gap in studio material has not affected the band's popularity whatsoever however this extreme love of Lovelace and this huge gap in studio releases can of course lead to some irrational expectations as well from music fans like for one a radical change in my Bloody Valentine sound may be an epic musical release that's going to blow people's minds even further than Lovelace did and the assumption that this album has to be amazing because every waking moment of the past 20 years has been spent working on this thing and I don't know I think when you actually think about the music that my bloody valentine time makes those expectations become kind of silly because I mean when you think about it is Lovelace really an epic album is it an album that's really trying to go out there and blow people's minds and thrill people and just get that adrenaline pumping in my opinion no I mean historically it is an epic and significant album but stylistically it's a very kind of droney album it's a very kind of sleepy album it's a very slow seductive intoxicating album and as far as radical changes go that's never really been my bloody Valentines mo either I mean like I said earlier they really kind of built up to the sound that they had in Lovelace from a kind of Gothic rock psychobilly post-punk sound in their earliest releases so My Bloody Valentine has never really been anything but slow and gradual when it comes to presenting the next chapter in their sound the band may have been recording on and off since the 90s there may have been inner band tensions rumors of writer's block and over an albums worth of material getting either thrown away or just forgotten I think music fans tend to take the story of a band's music and throw all this behind-the-scenes stuff in there all too often when I mean I don't feel like we do that in any other instance I mean for sure when we sit down and watch movie we don't think of what the director said or what drama was going on behind the cameras as we're watching it instead we suspend belief and just kind of enjoy the story for what it is that's being presented to us on the screen so right now there's just like all this space junk orbiting around this LP which I'm sure Kevin Shields and company are well aware of as well however the band basically concentrates instead on just what's next for My Bloody Valentine and kind of taking things from where they left off to be completely straight and honest about it mbv sounds pretty much just like what my Bloody Valentine was going for back in their heyday in the early 90s and I suspect that's the case because some of what is here on this album was conceived and maybe recorded during the 90s but that's not the case for every single song on here and I think it's even more impressive that my Bloody Valentine was able to take all this material from different points in the band's career and kind of pull it together in this seamlessly surreal haze that kind of tingles the ears with its sound play this LP is full of just surreal washes of jeroni thick guitars maybe a little bit thicker because of modern recording technology but these heavy dreamy guitars are obscuring just whisper quiet vocals murky bass and drums on a lot of tracks here especially on the opener she found now starts this album off is just being very mind-altering and fuzzy there are all these bright shimmering guitar chords that are just being thrown shattering and breaking into a million pieces against these thick walls of guitar buzz which is just another testament to how odd this Bands approach to mixing is and just kind of placing instruments in certain places there's just no group out there like My Bloody Valentine making shoegaze music just like this and what's weird is that loveless came out in 1991 I mean every group out there pretty much had the opportunity to make an album either in this style or try to improve upon what My Bloody Valentine was doing back in the day yet nobody's attempted that has really succeeded in my opinion there have certainly been offshoots there have been groups that have taken extreme inspiration from what my Bloody Valentine has done over the years applied it to what they do and have come out with great fantastic seminal music in their own right but still My Bloody Valentine and I feel like this album proves it is still the band when it comes to having that simultaneous sense of noise and beauty a lot of the melodies a lot of the vocals on this LP they're sweet they're cute they're saccharine they're just like they're airy they're very pretty but they're just thrown into this blender of nastiness and war and though again that may not necessarily be a formula that appeals to a lot of people because essentially you're hearing the song behind all of these noisier elements all these effects I mean it's really these effects that kind of make the album appealing because it's so weird it just kind of buries itself in my head in the right way to the point where it kind of shakes things around stirs my mind changes my perception of sound and puts me in a trance now the next two tracks on this LP get a little bit heavier the album kind of eases the listener into the sense of intensity rather than kind of hitting them with the track like only shallow like the Bandit on level as years ago right from the get-go the album kind of reaches this peak in its first third or so with the song who sees you which has these dizzying hums of overblown fuzzy guitars as I listen to the song and it's just kind of got this sweet pop sensibility but it's monolithically just sort of trudging forward the way that it's it sort of puts me in this mind-numbing mental state where I feel like I'm just kind of ready to blissfully drool on myself however the band kind of breaks this fuzzy streak with the song and is this yes which is kind of an ambient stop along the way it's this very still little keyboard piece that is one of the longer songs on here reaching six minutes and just kind of quietly hums at a very high pitch bleeps and bloops belinda butchers vocals and they're kind of floating around in the mix the song does kind of have its own tone to it it's light it's not as heavy as many of the other songs on here but I wish it didn't I don't know just have this sense of dragging on meandering there are definitely layers to this track but I wish the layers were altered a little bit more manipulated they feel so clear so pristine maybe just a little too sanitary for what I would expect from My Bloody Valentine song and as long as we're talking about clear sounds on this LP the song knew you also kind of heads down that road this is one of the clearer friendlier tracks I've heard My Bloody Valentine put together it's got this kind of straightforward 60s psych pop groove to it with this nice vintage bass line kind of hip shaking drum beat tremolo guitars whisper quiet vocals I just kind of wish the song sort of went a little further past this one groove that it seems to present for the entire thing the change in groove or speed or intensity would have been nice because the song does not really sound play in the same way that many other tracks on here do these two tracks for me are really the only deviations clarity wise from the rest of this LP after the song My Bloody Valentine heads back down into the sweet sonic muck with the song if I am which has this beautiful vocal melody weird wah-wah guitar squawking against another dense layer of fuzz and the way that this Waga Tarr moves is kind of like hearing waves of fuzz underneath waves of fuzz underneath waves of fuzz following after that in another way is really the hardest rocking song on here the blaring guitars right at the start of this track that just featured loads and loads of feedback are sharp and just ear piercing and as the song moves forward it just gets heavier hardier really one of the harder rocking tracks that this band is put together since some of their earlier EPS however after this the album doesn't really present any interesting finishes or any closure or anything like that I mean My Bloody Valentine presents themselves as being more experimentalists than they are you know traditional album structures or anything like that the song nothing is is a kind of interesting experiment with this drumbeat that continuously just gets louder and louder and louder with noisy guitars and after that the closing track which I do like however not really as a finisher it's titled wonder - it's maybe one of the most heavily treated tracks on this entire LP one of the thickest tracks on here and kind of makes me wonder why other songs didn't kind of see this layer upon layer upon layer upon layer of treatment you kind of get of course these thick guitars and underneath this is this very very obscure drum beat that seems to get busier and busier and busier as the song moves on kind of as if it was a jazz fusion drum beat or like a drum and bass drum B or something like that and the way the vocal melody is moving on this track especially underneath all of these effects it kind of sounds like something panda bear would sing it's a strange track that in a way feels sort of akin to something Animal Collective would do however it could have been written potentially before Animal Collective even existed overall with this new LP my Bloody Valentine just pretty much gives you what I guess you would expect no epic overreaching of what the band has done on loveless just another collection of experiments in this shoegaze style which I think the band has kind of proven themselves to be still in the top-ranking of however you know shoegaze is kind of this micro genre which there's not a ton of competition in I'm not saying it's easy to do what my Bloody Valentine is doing I mean certainly it's difficult for any band to maintain the amount of popularity that they have over the years despite the small amount of releases however if anybody is going to come through with a pretty good or great shoegaze album I mean who else is going to do it but one of the originators of the genre I think my only real disappointments with this LP is I just wish you were a bit longer even though this thing does still kind of sit in the same time range as loveless I think some of the songs on here were kind of cut short not all that well developed or kind of felt like experiments that really didn't go much of anywhere that's only a handful of tracks though I think my only other disappointment was that with the vocals they feel a lot less I guess sweet youthful and and tweet inspired than what I remember from the band's previous stuff yes I know vocals have never really been the focal point of my ability Valentine's music and maybe that's why I'm not really that upset by the change on this album because the sounds are still here the studio work is still here just that weird experimentation that sonic seduction is still here and because of that I did enjoy this LP quite a bit I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next

nerd and it's time for review of the new Arcade Fire album everything now this is the latest full-length album from Montreal indie outfit actually indie legends Arcade Fire this is their fifth studio album and now it's been well over ten years since the band's debut album funeral genre-defining record a high point for indie rock tons of epic lavishly arranged songs on this thing packed with passionate vocals the record also in my opinion has a flawless flow and then the band followed that up a few years later with the equally epic Neon Bible a record that featured a lot of religious themes heavenly musical highs dark depressing lows and then the band's third record I also enjoyed the suburbs it was kind of like a little baby in a sugar bowl the band going in a little bit more of a socially conscious direction this time around more of a societal scope to their criticism their most direct album yet in my opinion as far as like the sound of a rock album goes lots of very strong Springsteen influences on a couple cuts here and then AB and delivered the sudden stylistic pivot with their record reflector several years ago the album boasted production from LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy and featured the band's most danceable material yet pulling influence directly from the worlds of disco and new wave now personally in my opinion this is where the band in their discography had first faltered easily the most inconsistent Arcade Fire album so far I thought it was kind of bloated the whole double disc thing really could have been cut down every step outside of the band's comfort zone felt like a haphazard experiment and not only that but as a dance music band Arcade Fire is mediocre at best coming away from reflector I had hoped that this record would just simply be a phase for the band but it's not a phase mom it's not a phase ah the dance beats are here to stay on the band's latest effort hear everything now which from the sound of the singles alone felt like the band is going to be going deeper into this territory and in fact they do there's not really a single moment on this album that feels like it kind of throws back to an older Arcade Fire which there were at least several on reflector it's almost like the transition is complete on this new record over here take the title track for example with it's glamorous shimmering instrumental reads a lot like an Abba instrumental except for wind Butler's lead vocals and the weird freakin woodwinds toward the end of the track that are actually not that good it's a song that I kind of have a love-hate relationship with my first impression of it was like oh here we go again I don't want more of this the last thing I want to hear is our cave fire indulging in this sound again however with repeated listens the song kind of won me over with it's dazzling piano melodies and lyrics about the oversaturation of the Information Age I kind of get the sense that the band is critiquing it trying to satirize it a little bit on this track but yet the instrumentation is just so glamorous and beautiful that I don't know it's it's almost like they're paying tribute to it as well like we're living in the middle of a beautiful glorious future where technology has phased out a lot of the inconveniences of mankind I think the maximal materialistic mentality of the modern age is an interesting topic for a band to approach on a record especially a group that is of an age where they most likely remember a time when they were younger where computers didn't rule almost every aspect of your life I kind of also get this vibe on the song signs of life where it feels like the band is a yearning for some kind of human or emotional connection but they just can't get it this track even though I was kind of lukewarm on it when I first heard it also won me over with its irresistible disco grooves and honestly just a few tracks into the track listing here I was kind of getting convinced that maybe Arcade Fire has turned over a new leaf and is now successfully going to be creating dance music on this thing I was really being convinced it was possible especially with Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter on production duties on this thing as well as Steve Mackey of pulp however it does not take long for everything now to completely fall apart in concept in Arrangements in writing in everything the song creature comfort has one of the most wonderful grooves on the entire record features these kind of buzzy throbbing since sequences that are very steady some glassy reverberating lead melody some roaring guitar chords that can song an epic feel but when the lyrics come in wind butler starts forcing this somewhat socially conscious message with these gender stereotypes that feel like they're lifted right out of the tones of a really depressing tumblr post boys that hate their dads and girls that cut themselves and want to commit suicide because they have body image issues these are not inherently bad things to sing about but our Kade fires approach is just so surface-level and given the concept of the album but man doesn't really do anything to connect this to I don't notice the mental oversaturation of again the modern day outside of kind of portraying these kids as wanting to be famous and these depictions of young people with emotional issues breach into narcissism when the band depicts this female protagonist as wanting to die she gets into the bathtub she's getting ready to commit suicide but she puts that first Arcade Fire album on first like really you know I didn't want to kill myself until I heard that even if this story is true like to include it in the way that the band did it just seems really self congratulatory and super meta at a moment when maybe we should be focusing on I don't know what the individual here is doing and why it really only gets worse from there as our Kaede Fire embarks upon a couple of reggae fusions on the next few tracks the band failed at flirting with this sound on their last record so I did not want a second helping however the instrumental to the song Peter Pan is actually not that bad there are lots of interesting textures throughout the track it's not quite as flat and as one-dimensional as like here comes the nighttime from reflector it leaves a little to be desired from a lyrical standpoint it seems kind of like just a very general love song but it is written from the heart as opposed to chemistry which feels like it's written from the hips when you read into the lyrics on this thing it actually comes off a little stalkerish not to mention the refrain kind of gets annoying after several listens it is a bit of an earworm though and oddly enough this instrumental not only brings another reggae groove but on the chorus it mixes it with these roaring hard rock riffs which come together pretty seamlessly as much as an abomination as the song is from like a lyrical standpoint and our writing standpoint it's just far too corny and sugary of the song for Arcade Fire to pull off with with the lack of irony that they're trying to still I do have to kind of give it to the band for like really kind of getting these two worlds to collide somewhat effectively after this the album kind of devolves further almost like it knows it's not going to redeem itself at this point with these two tracks infinite content and infinite underscore content it's pretty much the same half written song one portion of it is this fast punk tinged indie track that kind of brings back the album central theme in the lyrics and then all of a sudden that ends and we get a slow dreamy country version of the track and then we get to electric blue which is easily the worst track on the record and not for its colorful keyboards and nocturnal grooves no it's because of one we have a really annoying lead melody that sounds like a some kind of animal being strangled and then that sound is like sampled into something rhythmic and then there are the completely unintelligible falsetto vocals from regime chisaem who I am usually pretty excited to hear on an arcade fire album usually when she brings some lead vocals on a cut it steals the show provides a nice break up in the tracklist here I want nothing more than the song to stop because her nasal like almost eardrum piercing vocal tone is so hideous I mean even her backup vocals at a couple points on the record are really shrill and brittle and just not very Oh wool after this the band tries to cool things down with the somewhat drab good goddamn a track where I kind of like the wordplay going on in the chorus that kind of ties into the visual of this person committing suicide that I feel like we were hit with on creature comfort the band is returning to it here and the you know wanting a good goddamn are sort of looking for a good goddamn sort of a angle in the hook is essentially either talking about oh I wish you know some God was up there who cared about this or some God would intervene or you know do something or fix the situation or you know a good goddamn meaning someone's interest or concern or help revisiting this feeling of loneliness in this really overwhelming world a strong feeling of isolation but these are feelings and these are intentions that I feel like I myself am projecting on the track given its concept there's not a whole lot in the lyrics here that actually kind of gives that away to me and not because I think the band is trying to be obscure or sort of hide some intentions or meanings of this track just once again I feel like wind Butler's vocals his lyrics rather are kind of approaching this topic at a very surface manner and once again we get this visual of put your food on booth and yes we know what that favorite record is it's the first Arcade Fire album thank you the song put your money on me miraculously is actually a pretty wonderful love song with ABBA vibes coming back into the fold toward the tail end of the track the song has a very cute course that essentially asks one's lover to put money on him bent on him being a sure thing that on him being there and being a faithful companion even though the instrumental is a bit of a slow burner it does have a very steady nice groove to it and it is worth your patience and the closing track matches these very lovesick vibes with this sense of heartache and longing that's pretty nice however I feel like this track kind of fails as any kind of wrap-up or summation to this very dodgy inconsistent album and concept the band is sort of thrown into our laps here it's hardly an effective send-off to this very lopsided project that being said the actual closing track is kind of this weird outro instrumental that is a bit of a reprieve where it brings back the theme melody to the title track but with this epic large string section and then this tract loops into the introduction tract the sort of introduction interlude which originally when I heard it I think is an awful start to the record and actually kind of stalls what should be an effective beginning I mean I guess it's kind of nice at the album somewhat loops back into itself but I don't want to hear again all the way through I mean I don't really like it and I'm not all that surprised because at the end of the day I feel like I'm just kind of getting a second helping of the band's last record sure everything now may head more boldly into a dance music direction it has a somewhat more coherent theme concept to it as far as length and tracklist ingo I guess it's a bit more manageable but across the entire track listing there are only a few songs that I'm actually excited by most of the record is just merely tolerable and there are at least a decent handful of tracks that I think are downright awful like literally Arcade Fire writing and recording their worst material to date so I don't know will the band finally just turn back from this ridiculous direction they've been speeding in for their past couple of records I hope so I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry next to my head

review of the new father John misty album God's favorite customer this is the latest full-length LP from singer/songwriter Josh Tillman aka father John misty Coppertone Winfrey no proper drawn whiskey mm-hmm no farmer Don Henley shut up shut up okay I thought about killing you today I thought about killing you I've also thought about killing myself and I love myself so I have no issue with thinking about killing you you're so mean I was just joking what's wrong with you so this is Tillman's fourth full-length LP and it's his follow-up to what was my album of the year last year the father John misty record pure comedy a record that was a fantastically grim piece of social satire with a lot of wit and balladry in heart however a lot of other publications and listeners didn't didn't so much seem to think so finding the album and Josh Tillman's performance to be very bloated and dreary and kind of pretentious and I will admit this album I love it but it is kind of a slog but you know hey an ode to humanity's path of self-destruction takes time so how do you follow up such an album a record that is easily your most epic and ambitious artistic statement to date and yet it wasn't really all that well-received by a lot of the people who loved your previous material I will say though in Josh's defense on this album there were several lyrical nods to people not taking to this new direction it's sort of sad to see the album going underappreciated but surely he was aware of what was going to happen here in the end it would have looked sillier to see Josh predicting under performance for this album in the face of great fanfare now unfortunately Josh's answer to the follow-up question with God's favorite customer to me is kind of play it safe go back to more song lengths and don't get so political revisit themes that fans enjoyed so much more on previous releases like relationship issues humorous character portrayal is a few playful nods to God and religion it also wouldn't be a father John misty record without him going super meta at least a few times and kind of breaking down the fourth wall but I will say even though josh has decided not to go all out on this latest record he mostly does maintain the same grand instrumental presence that pure comedy had the tracklist on this thing has a great flow a very strong start a lot of dark ballads matched with very appropriate pick me ups to kind of add balance and even though this record is not as loaded with social commentary as its predecessor I kind of see it as an equally grim release which sees Josh exploring some incredibly dark corners of his mind on tracks like please don't die and the palace and if there is a thematic thread that pulls a great deal of this album together it's that it's Josh's mental state it's depression its substance abuse its how these things are affecting his marriage and it's also suicide with lots of lavish instrumentation more straightforward tunes and a more personal focus lyrically no doubt this album is going to appeal to a wider array of people and it seems like the reception and the reviews so far reflect that heavily but really at what cost because while I like this record quite a bit I also kind of feel like I'm being pandered too I don't know exactly what's driving it is the lack of breathing room between this record and its predecessor or something else either way it just kind of feels like josh is simply going back to what he already knows works what he already knows the audience receives well as some of the tunes on this thing just feel kind of typical for Josh because when it comes to the instrumental palette the aesthetics some of the melodies chord progressions I get a lot of musical deja vu on GFC it's just kind of unfortunate that Josh wasn't able to drum up a more distinct sound and personality for this album given that the matically it's very different from everything that he has released previously sure while josh has addressed issues like depression in the passed in song this record feels like it's trying to be more of a deep dive into his psyche I mean this is the first father John misty album to have Tillman pictured right on the front cover and that's mostly because he is the subject of this record and not just in the sense that josh is playing the narrator or a character in his own song I mean the tracks on this thing feel more like a meta-analysis or in autopsy so while I embrace the thematic direction josh is going in on this thing there are moments where the sound of this album leaves me feeling like I'm listening to a meager but personal extension of his last album or their moments on the album where I feel like he doesn't really nail it he fails to bring the audience a truly unique view on the issue of course they're still highlights all throughout the album though the song mr. Tillman is dark it's charismatic it's hilarious it's well produced it's sung from the standpoint of like some hotel lobby employee expressing concern for Tillman's erratic and strange behavior I love the folk rock guitars and drums and heavy piano on this track there are some beautiful vocal layers on this track too and a very smart nod to singer-songwriter Jason Isbell the song just dumb enough to try is another favorite of mine on here and features these dramatic and beautiful piano chords and acoustic guitar arpeggios the track is essentially about Josh's mental and emotional issues driving a wedge in the relationship between him and his wife with a lot of the lyrics of this song portraying Josh as inadequate as a partner as a lover the song is essentially an emotional build-up to Josh kind of gaining the courage to get his back together try to make this thing work and essentially start his life again I thought the song date night was pretty great too despite it being such an oddball in the tracklisting it's a short vignette sized piece of funky desert rock with kind of low fight drums that sound panned all the way to one side high-pitched vocal harmonies that sound like something out of a Queens of the Stone Age song in between these moments josh delivers this kind of deadpan talk singing where he's really on his Lou Reed the lyrics read a lot like a funny surreal trip or something which kind of shows the duality of Josh's mental state on this record you had these blissful abstract highs and then plenty of lucid dejected depressing lows please don't die as a beautiful ballad but also really harrowing as well as the song is sung in part from the standpoint of his significant other basically begging him not to kill himself the song is pretty powerful and all about the devastation she would feel if she were to lose him in a lot of ways the track reminds me of that smoochy cut from pure comedy last year which was essentially about Josh's wife comforting him or kind of you know talking him back from the ledge whenever he would be in a depressive state the genius and gorgeous title track on this thing sees Josh kind of addressing his religious background acknowledging that he's pretty much lost touch with it but then coming back and and calling on it in order to I guess find some sort of sanctuary from the mental and personal demons that he's dealing with he's calling on God in his time of need reminding God that hey I was really religious way back when I was I was your favorite customer there is a wonderful vocal performance from wise blood and the last leg of the track she sort of comes in provides this really angelic and haunting background vocal to Josh's tune that is really one of the highest points on the record now with all that being said there are a few low points on the album for me as well I didn't really like the track disappointing diamonds at all as a teaser it makes a lot more sense in the track listing because it sounds like a very peppy segue moment but I still find the very bumi and maxed out instrumentation and falsetto vocal harmonies to be a really hideous sound I do give the track points though for having incredibly interesting lyrics though where josh is essentially singing an ode to flawed love talking about how something perfect or that lasts forever probably isn't that special anyway songs like the palace and the songwriter I'm a little conflicted with musically I feel like Josh is treading water but I do enjoy the sentiments the messages of these songs on the palace Josh essentially portrays himself as being holed up in a hotel room doing drugs being afraid to leave but I feel like the sadness and the tension of this moment doesn't really come through in Josh's performance outside of the very weary vocal delivery that he has on board when he sings that in over his head refrain overall to me the song just feels like a mild snapshot of what could have been an incredibly interesting and manic moment on the record the songwriter as well to me musically feels a little uninspired a little drab but again I enjoy the lyrics I enjoy the sentiment the concept of the song Josh getting down to the crux of Fame performer subject artist addressing his wife as his muse and kind of throwing this hypothetical out there where what would happen if we switched places would you be as honest and constantly mining our relationship in our private life for source material for your music in the way that I do in that sense the song seems almost like an apology for throwing the intimate details of their life out there in his music and where only people is such a painfully flaccid closing track the lyrics during the first leg of the song are easily the most uninspired on the entire record like people what's the deal it reads like a Jerry Seinfeld stand-up routine and and basically gets to the heart of almost nothing you've been hurt I've been hurt what do we do now mm-hmm I feel like Josh was addressing these exact issues on his last record but in such greater detail it feels like there's something here but whatever it is Josh isn't really getting at it and it feels like he's not even trying to like he's dumbing it down for the audience or something I think the last few stanzas of the song are pretty poetic but it just kind of feels like too little too late at that point there are some subtle suicidal themes on the track as well so I guess that kind of ties in with the rest of the record too but the track just feels like a cliffhanger with no incentive to stick around for part two overall I like this album quite a bit there are a lot of great tracks on it but I can't help but feel like Josh's punching under his weight a little bit it's not quite as focused or fulfilling as it could have been but concept is a little too disheveled despite some of the very heavy and personal topics of this record occasionally it feels like josh is just scratching the surface it's not amazing but it's very good and and very good bye Josh Tillman standards and above average Josh Tillman album is still going to be leagues better than most of what you find in the singer-songwriter field these days and even when playing into expectations he still manages to come through with a lot of great tracks I feeling a decent too strong seven

time for a sickly review of the new Glassjaw album material control 15 years later and finally a comeback album from Hempstead New York band Glassjaw a post-hardcore outfit who fractured in the 2000s after two full length records everything you ever wanted to know about silence and worship and tribute neither of which are really truly highlights for me in the genre I certainly see the appeal of worship and tribute sure but aside from the occasionally frantic and dissonant and sort of spastic guitar passages on that record I found the band compositionally to be average at best and the singing of frontman Daryl Palumbo always struck me as being borderline silly always pulling off these super overdone vocalizations that I just could not really stand for whatever reason yet somehow I'm really into the band blood brothers figure that one out in the 2000s I think it's safe to say that I respected Glassjaw more than I actually enjoyed them I thought they were definitely cut above a lot of the sweeter post hardcore bands out there that had a strong appeal in the emo community but they weren't really clicking with a younger me like I was very much more a Fugazi guy Drive Like Jehu guy big black or even a McCluskey guy so as a result I can't say I went into this new glass draw album with the highest of hopes but I was definitely curious as to how the band would sound after over a decade of studio album silence and I got to say I think they really kind of came back with a vengeance on this one some parts of this record are a friggin barn burner the band is going full volume on this thing full density full energy full dynamic range the mix on this thing is thick like a cheese cake lasagna the guitars and bass on this thing are mixed to sound so heavy which of course are topped with all these wild freaky dissonant guitar leads and solos the drumming is very OnPoint though a lot of the time I'll say it's pretty lost in the chaos and miraculously Daryl has kind of refined his vocal style on this one while the studio here doesn't sound quite as organic as it has in the past the band is definitely sounding cleaner and sleeker especially now with Darrell singing sounding like a combination of Chino from Deftones Mike Patton era Faith No More a little bit of Perry from Jane's Addiction and just like a smidge of Cedric from Mars Volta and at the drive-in it's not the most original sound I've ever heard but certainly is appealing to me a little bit more than much of the band's early material and it seems like all the band's I just mentioned are having like a bit of a compositional influence on glass jaw this time around too though the band is pretty much known as being a post-hardcore group from over a decade ago you can't really come away from this album saying that they're just carrying the torch for an old sound or that they're stuck in the past still though occasionally Darrell does come through on this album with these obnoxious overextended vocalizations like on Bible land or my conscious weighs a ton or especially on the song citizen [Music] I I just do not see the appeal of this vocal style seriously extending your vocal notes out to the point where the vocal melody loses any memorability is just kind of the still again I do think this album presents vocal improvements all around just keep in mind that's the opinion of somebody who wasn't really a huge glass jaw fan to begin with in my opinion when this album is at its best its delivering to listeners these layered sour tense verses that suddenly transition into these crushing riffey hooks that just destroy everything in their path like on the multi-phase Pompeii which considering the structure of the song it's kind of progressive also the incredibly enraged new white extremity that kicks the entire record off and then you have the surprisingly sweet Shira which transitions into a soaring and an incredibly melodic and a really captivating hook that if there's any point on the album that shows a huge Deftones influence it's it's right here the closing track on this thing is relatively solid too there are certainly a number of highlights in the track listing here but there are also a handful of completely innocuous cuts that only seem to pad the track listing out which this is only like a 36 minute album there's not that much material on it to begin with an album of this size and shape and expectation level given that it is a comeback album should just be all killer and no filler and yet we have the title track on this thing which is like a weird Bumi drum loop complete with these frantic little guitar passages it sounds like a battles demo and then the song Bastille Day seems like a weird percussion circle that never quite goes anywhere interesting though it does transition into the following track kind of nicely and then we have the very moody and long-winded strange hours whose atmosphere whose aesthetic is very despondent I do like the emotional variety it brings to the record but compositionally this this entire song would just be awash if it weren't for the swell of distorted guitars and melodic vocals on the hook it's not interesting for the entirety of its runtime nor is it one of the better songs on this thing overall this is a pretty good record considering it's been 15 years since the last one it certainly came through harder and heavier and more aggressive than I thought it was going to be but it's still kind of an inconsistent album and yet one-dimensional this album rarely veers outside of the tone that is set at the beginning of the album with the pummeling guitars and the wailing lead vocals and when it does it leads to some of the album's most awkward moments I do hope that glass drought continues though it does seem on this record they wanted to give fans something different and show them that after all these years they're still willing to continue to evolve and take risks as opposed to simply just pandering and doing what they've done all along as long as they continue to maintain that mindset there's always going to be a chance for interesting music coming down the pipe I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next to

REVIEW","y":6,"x":"and then again review this again okay ten review will again okay hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new annob√≥n house wolf album the miraculous swedish singer songwriter and organist composer miss anna von house wolf this is her latest full-length album which is following up 2012's hidden gem ceremony a record that I was highly anticipating at the time of its release however it didn't really end up wow me on this record you will hear mostly lonesome dramatic vocals cutting through beds of organ drones it's simple but only sometimes effective however I saw enough potential here to the point where I would be excited for whatever anna was going to be doing in the future I was excited for this new record over here and I'm happy to say that this new record over here is much bigger it's a much larger album it expands past the droney somewhat dream poppy sounds of her last record some inspiration coming from genres such as progressive rock and even a little bit of metal a touch of post rock to kind of like on the Swans and Godspeed end of that spectrum now of course the organs and Anna's vocals are still very much a focal point on these songs on this record Anna's vocals are very haunting they are expressive and the backing musicians here provide some pretty versatile and dynamic tracks for Anna to sing over between the drums and the organ and the bass here there are mountains of low frequency on this name as well as some gorgeous sweet and tender highs and the recording here is really organic it's really intimate it sounds very live and in the moment and fluid it's almost as if the whole thing was recorded in a church right then and there with no or very minimal overdubbing which might in fact be the case because it sounds like anna is again playing a large old-school organ and it's not like you could just pick that up and take it somewhere else now prior to the release of this record I thought and his singing was pretty but their moments on here on this new album where I think it is turned electrifying especially as she's reaching up into her higher range on tracks like come wander with me however this is one of only a few longer tracks on the record that I really like and there are other spots on here that I'm not all that impressed by this album has a really odd flow to it we have three songs here which are longer and all together add up to about three fifths of the album's runtime we're talking songs that are roughly about 10 minutes each and on these songs this is where the album's greatest most epic and most ambitious statements lie like on the mostly instrumental song discovery which has this hard rocking and progressive intro vocals actually don't show up in this track until about the seven minute mark and everything up until that point is propelled by this building fast just high-octane rock instrumentation it's it's really great and then an ominous drone follows and it gets really heavy it gets really dense it's like listening to the soundtrack of an army prepping for the battle to end all battles the song come wander with me is equally huge and and a lot of the time showcases Anna's voice wandering through this incredibly vast and open drone created by the backing instrumentation eventually the song erupts into these really sinister guitar and drum passages which are amazingly dark it's like all of a sudden the band has shifted into something that resembles that of like an old-school doom metal track there are guitar licks on this album that feel like they are pulled right out of the Tony Iommi playbook and the title track of this album is actually a very hypnotic beautiful and kind of long winded drone a bulk of the other songs on this album however are nowhere near as long they don't feel anywhere near as developed and in comparison are almost like detours and just kind of inconsequential just like they're sort of killing time with these shorter tracks consistently we get abrupt endings and musical ideas that just aren't really as developed sort of like on the song and oath or on the song Tom Perry poza we're on this track we get these creepy gothic chords and these blissful organs on this track as well the lead vocals are stunning but eventually the track just evaporates into nothing or the hope only of empty men we have very weary vocals on this track the organs are beautiful hypnotic once again but the track evaporates into nothing Anna and her band they developed some cool musical ideas or they set a great mood but once that mood has been established they just don't take it anywhere beyond that initial development there are a few exceptions like the song evocation or The Closer here which is kind of like this spaghetti western themed dark little acoustic guitar backed ballad it's very dramatic it's very dark kind of reminds me of the doors a little bit in a way but aside from that I feel like so many other songs here could have gone longer but still the album is about 50 minutes long as is and it's just about nine tracks so with these three songs and those two other tracks that I think are quite good I did end up enjoying a bulk of the album here it's just that it's so painfully obvious that more length and more development to at least a couple of these tracks could have made this record better so there are some painfully loose ends in the track listing here unfortunately I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this record a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next that's it Antoine Phan Tuan annob√≥n house wolf the miraculous forever "},{"id":"7TABeq5TLGY","title":"Natalia Lafourcade - Musas Vol. 2 ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone ex the nice Ike tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Natalia la huaca de album muses vol 2 Natalia is a Mexican pop singer whose talents have been reverberating louder and louder north of the border over the last few years mostly thanks to her 2015 album hasta la race an album that successfully blended elements of Latin American folk with contemporary twee and indie pop also last year she landed a pretty prominent vocal spot on Disney's coco soundtrack and in 2017 she also embarked on the first volume of the music series that this record is the sequel to which from what I've read I guess the sessions were so fantastic and there were so many musical results from them that there was enough material for another volume now the previous installment of muses to me red as Natalia exploring a variety of shades and sounds within the world of Latin American folk but still in a way maintaining a pretty firm grip on her Papa roots but muses volume 2 to me reads like a little bit more of a clean break from the poppier sounds of the last record to be blunt about it this album is pretty much 13 tracks almost an hour of elegant gorgeous beautiful and rustic Latin American folk which really runs the emotional and instrumental gamut from the incredibly groovy and bombastic opening track the rhythms the horns the background vocals on this track it's all bright it's all vivid it all hits incredibly hard we quickly transition into more low-key moments on the album like Alma Mia a track that is as quiet as it is stunningly beautiful it's a song where you the instrumentation is not quite as aggressive not quite as loud and instead we get a lot more interesting very jazzy chord phrasings and guitar embellishments throughout the track all of which are executed on these very crystal-clear plucky nylon strings the ballot on a media Uno is aided by some very nice glossy reverb steady guitar strumming some very nice harmonized guitar leads so that that kind of sparkle like stars in the night sky which Natalia's voice just within like a moon a big bright beautiful full moon the song - so he dose changes things up with a three four time signature some really sharp snappy rhythms beautiful they just melt my brain the song do where main Negrito has these very steady mid-paced sensual rhythm guitars and while yes there is a language barrier at work here for me there's just a mood and a vibe of the track that feels distinctly kind of sassy and coy no surprise that a track titled luz de luna has kind of a nocturnal vibe to it it's one of the milder moments on the album for me maybe a bit of a lull in the record but still it does feel kind of special in that while it is not the loudest or the quietest or the most stark track on the entire record it is one of the most intimate it feels like one of the closest tracks like Natalia's voice the guitars they just really kind of create almost like a beautiful but kind of claustrophobic sense of space on the song almost like her and los Marino's are kind of trying to keep the song a secret the beefy drums and rhythms on the track derecho are fantastic they add a lot to the hypnotic guitars on the cut there's also this nice sweet droning tone that pops up in the background of the course that just adds a lot of a very subtle tension to the song and there's also the very dreamy and inspiring track eclipse which is so beautiful and just so serene that I want to wrap myself in it like a blanket and get into the fetal position and go to sleep for the rest of my life the song destined Ossa in comparison with the other tracks here has kind of a play style and a chord progression that feels distinctly older distinctly archaic in comparison with a lot of the peppier and smoother and more contemporary sounds on these Latin American folk styles and I think the reason for that might have been that there are two vocal guests on this track actually two pretty big names in Latin American music oma report une dough in Eugenia Lyon believe me I'm in over my head here when it comes to a lot of this music I'm not expert on either their careers or anything like that however I do know a good recording when I hear one I know some decent production when I hear it and I know a good vocal performance when I hear one as well these three kind of trade verses and their points on the song where they harmonize collectively and God God is it gorgeous the intense pacing of the song tastes ego raises my heart rate the closing acoustic instrumental on the album is very nice touch as well that I enjoyed a lot I'll say that maybe there are a few tracks that kind of pale in comparison to others and as a record it is a little bit bloated I do kind of prefer that in a way the last installment of this series was tighter at around 45 minutes but still the material on here is fantastic it is high-grade it is high-quality and this is easily one of my favorite records of the year one of the most beautiful albums I've had the pleasure of listening to this year again some points feel a little comatose and and as an entire album it can feel kind of Sammy Sammy which is maybe why again I wish that tracklist was pared down just a smidge just a little bit but overall like this is easily one of the best albums in the genre I think you may hear this year I'm feeling a strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it do you like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful

of this new porches record pool porches is the longtime musical project of mr. Aaron Maine this is one of several albums and EPS that he's already dropped under this name but previous porches records had not only an entirely different label this record is now on Domino records but an entirely different sound this thing clearly has a bigger budget behind it more clarity to the instrumentation and with that clarity with that bigger budget it sounds like Aaron wanted to kind of graduate the project beyond its loafie aesthetic its lo-fi rock aesthetic of the previous records which is fine I don't want an artist to have to force a sound that they don't feel natural playing with anymore especially if they're in a different place creatively but what the band has graduated to on this record is very simple straightforward mutti mutti mutti synth pop it's a little 80s pastiche with a kind of standoffish demeanor and even though it is very much a pop affair there's nothing feel good about it this thing is like the soundtrack to some light depression or trying to look cool and even though I I do see issues with it on the surface level deeper I do think there are some good intentions behind this project generally I think the instrumentals are decent or okay on this thing they maybe run a little too skeletal and lethargic but this thing is really upfront it has nothing to hide it could have easily been another washed out synth led dream pop record that I've been using for the past few months to keep warm this winter looks like it could use another word record though  those guys the instrumentals on this thing they're soft but they're meaty the beats are really resonant the synth bass is really resonant the lead synthesizers are very glossy the shimmer they're pretty some tracks like be apart have a really strong groove to them or at least a relatively strong groove in comparison with the other tracks meanwhile other songs kind of elicit some very light head bobbing there are some nice additions to these tracks and cool since solos or instrumental bridges there's a nice saxophone that pops up on the song shaver that was really sweet there's some decent hooks here and there the song car is definitely a highlight that song has a lot more energy behind it than some of the other tracks here and I love the driving bass and drums on the song mood the chord progressions and the synth leads are really cool they kind of have a nostalgic quirk to them that reminds me a little bit of aerial pink but the obvious Achilles heel of this project something that I think takes down the quality of these instrumentals of these songs and it makes this record difficult to listen to are the vocals and given they have not been perfect or top-notch on previous porches records you could even argue that that was just a part of the Bands style but that's one of the few things about porches that seems to have carried over to this new project over here and it just does not fit all that snugly into these very glossy sleek simple synth pop instrumentals in fact they sound kind of awkward not only is most of the singing on this thing just super lethargic and elongated it monie but as far as pitch goes singing is flat flat flat flatter than day-old store-brand soda that's been sitting out and the singing can be kind of endearing for a few songs but it gets really old really fast especially on the slow cuts they don't really have a strong beat or an instrumental to kind of carry the track and then there are a few cuts here the feature auto-tune which just sounds silly and the off-key singing I think could have been helped along with some more passionate vocal deliveries or maybe even some lyrics that were just swallowed but the singing style on this thing in a way is just so one note occasionally Aaron does reach up in his higher register which isn't exactly on point either but it is a change of pace and like I said his singing does tend to kind of smudge the lyrics to the point where the lyrics are no longer even a focus if I want it to be one you know it's it's just a shame when our record just has one glaring characteristic about it that makes it difficult for you to enjoy the things on it that you see actual merit in and I think that the vocals on this record funnily enough have some potential to them like maybe the singing could be better with some practice sort of lessons or maybe just a little more focus there are moments where the singing on this record is okay it just seems like it could have been cleaned up I'm feeling a ladies in five on this thing transition have you given the something a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate at you two best you die best what should I review next I need sleep go to sleep Anthony Fantana porches Rob Scallon you're the man you're the man Rob Scallon forever "},{"id":"ixElcxn6PlQ","title":"Kanye West - ye ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"no theny wait a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kanye West album yay this is the eighth studio album from Chicago native rapper songwriter singer visionary meme provocateur Kardashian cohabit er mr. Kanye West now like usual with a kanye album there was a kind of tumultuous lead-up to the release of this album which of course we have to untangle for a little bit before we talk about the material on this record itself earlier this year Kanye West made a return to Twitter and started frantically dropping all of these weird motivational tweets many of which his fans got behind I guess it felt kind of cool to be caught up in Kanye's mind-state during the creative process of this record but then things kind of took a turn for the worst on Twitter when Kanye started endorsing Donald Trump and wearing the maggot hat then doing one erratic interview after another where his words just didn't really make all that much sense it became painfully clear that he didn't really know a lot about what he was talking about so the past couple of weeks for Kanye have yes been exciting but also very revealing embarrassing and very concerning to of course this is not the first time Kanye's contrarian tendencies have gotten him in hot water or had turned his fans against him so in concept what was happening wasn't altogether new however after the Charlamagne and TMZ interviews it did kind of feel like he was heading toward some kind of point of no return where he was either going against the grain just to go against it or making a fool of himself for attention not only that but there were a few weird non-album tracks released prior to this album that seemed to deal directly in this sort of social media storm Kanye had drummed up for himself the one he did with ti a versus the people was particularly cringy where he kind of tries to work through the mental gymnastics that brought him to this point where he was endorsing Trump on Twitter and then reflecting on the backlash for that with TI kind of playing to him it's also been reported since the TMZ interview since Kanye's 400 years of slavery comment he actually redid quite a bit of the music on this album which given that some of these very recent events are laced into the lyrics of a few parts on this record that's uh I don't know more or less believable but just like yay advertised weeks and weeks and weeks ago this latest record of his is a seven track release and it lasts just 24 minutes in a way it feels very much in league with his recent collaboration with push a tee Daytona which was similarly short sweet and direct which is one thing for push a tee to do a record like this it's an entirely different thing for Kanye to do it because yeah is totally stripped of the extravagance we typically get out of a Kanye release at least a newer Kanye release all the extra bells and whistles and guests I mean there are a few here but there's not really a whole lot on this record that sounds as larger-than-life as anything off of tila or yeezus or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy not only that but this record does kind of feel like it was pulled together in a relatively short amount of time and honestly for Kanye I kind of find this record to be a refreshing direction because it's been such a long time since we've heard Kanye in the raw like this in such an unfiltered state and not just emotionally but also sonically with a bulk of the production on this thing being handled by him and frequent collaborator Mike Dean who yeh has been making tracks with for so long no doubt he's playing a very supportive role in this release and we also have a little additional production on this thing from apex Martin and Jay Pope and Benny Blanco as well as Francis and lights however the instrumentals on this thing don't sound too much different from what yeh delivered on Pusha T's Daytona there's a similar emphasis on very simple mixes patterns and layering as well as kind of experimental and strange synth sounds and samples and sure while on the surface yeh might seem less experimental than Kanye's oddity opus in 2016 the life of Pablo this is probably the most intimate and unguarded Kanye has been on a record since the college dropout and even though it's not as all-encompassing as jay-z's 444 it's on a similarly personal vibe this thing opens up would be very freaky and intense I thought about killing you which is literally about what the title suggests the track kicks off with these really angelic and subtle background vocal harmonies that are kind of chilling and strange very otherworldly and Kanye isn't rapping at the start of this cut as much as he is just kind of delivering some spoken word talking about killing you talking about killing himself talking about how he sort of struggles with these feelings and this decision despite loving himself and loving you not you you but you know the person he has in mind that person he has in mind being Kanye West himself because of the bipolar angle of the record so at least that's how I'm kind of reading the the lyrics of the song given the mental health angle of the album I'd be lying if I said that I'd never had similarly dark thoughts bitching at the back of my head from time to time and I think that's the case for most people I think but on this track I think Kanye delivers an interesting moment where the audience has to give a bit of pause and kind of reconcile these dark thoughts that they may have in their head from time to time I also love how he kind of portrays these incredibly beautiful thoughts and in love for the people around him those feelings kind of being wrapped in these darker feelings sort of like is his emotions for his family his loved one so on and so forth those sort of inhabit the same dark corners of his mind that some of his worst characteristics come out of deeper into the track he talks about encouraging listeners to speak more freely talking about having to potentially rewrite this song or other songs or other lyrics or whatever just being worried how the audience will take it having to compensate for this fear that the listener will take something that he said very negatively the song eventually starts to build with this very steady kind of melodic flow a freaky beats which up with these horrific blood-curdling screams and really glassy since Kanye rapping about working on a different set of rules being easily provoked it just kind of functions really well as an introduction to this album which i think is just kind of an exploration of a snapshot of Kanye's headspace around this exact point in time the song yikes goes even deeper into Kanye's dark mental state where he is essentially as scary himself and the people around him there's a winning song hook from Kanye a very simple beat but an incredibly killer flow and the lyrics on this thing essentially portray a man who is on the edge high off of his own ego and psychedelic drugs to rapping about praying for Russell Simmons because he got me to that lying on here about saying a of watch he has a hospital band talking about Prince and Michael Jackson trying to warn him maybe it's a spiritual something that's kind of making him see this vision or maybe it's him in the midst of a trip I don't know maybe it's as a result of the kind of mental disorders that he references so boldly on the front cover of this thing either way this track is simultaneously one of Kanye is darkest and catchiest yet the song all mine is the first moment on the album that I think this thing really falters and mostly because the opening guest vocals which are kind of sung in this very childish very silly falsetto are a little off-putting at first the B is a little too minimal the song itself I think is a little too short yeh still sounds like a total monster on the track and sexually sort of seems to laser focus on his addiction to sex and women and while he's definitely hinted toward this very hard on tracks previous this is the first time where I feel like he's he's really portrayed this desire of his as a real dark side of himself as a real addiction something that truly makes him feel almost like sick it's a character flaw I also love the noisy abrasive samples that yeh tosses into the last leg of the track it really kind of brings the song to life gives the track and incredibly experimental edge and to me reads like Kanye just internally screaming through his production I think the record bounces back pretty hard on the song wouldn't leave which is essentially about Kanye dealing with the fallout of his political comments on Twitter having to calm his wife down because you we're gonna lose it all and so on and so forth the song basically turns into a beautiful ode to women who stick by their very broken men and I like the partynextdoor hook on this thing a lot like this track the hook on it the harmonized vocals is a very kind of slick old-school like throwback 80s R&B vibe to it very smooth I would not have pinned this as being partynextdoor singing had I not known also the glamorous keys on this thing are really tasteful these subtle percussion goes over really well and this transitions fantastically into the song no mistakes which essentially continues the narrative of the album Kanye's sort of acknowledging this dark side of himself acknowledging how it's affecting this very important and significant relationship of his if the previous song on this thing is love being questioned then this song is love being affirmed and between Kanye's flow his delivery the instrumental on this thing this is some seriously classic Kanye West like he's really throwing it back on this song to the point where the song sounds almost like a mixtape that came out in the 2000s got a bit of a low fie quality to it that I liked a lot the song ghost town featuring Kid Cudi might in fact be a bit of a teaser toward the kids see ghost collaboration that him in the cud stir have coming out around the corner and it's maybe one of my favorite tracks on this thing it just has a very generous soul sample hanging in the background of course Cudi singing his appearance on the song is a little rough especially when it's kind of region high registered I don't quite know what it is it seemed like he was really holding out of the melody very well in the first leg of that two line bar that he has to sing but then he just sort of drops it I think it really could have been helped with another take but believe it or not this song actually features some of Kanye's best singing in a long time I mean his singing has always been rough and granted it's not perfect here but like he's actually singing pretty well I just love the nostalgic beat the blaring distorted guitar also that weird John Legend intro on this thing seems like he's almost overcome with the emotion of the song his performance the instrumental I'm not really sure but it kind of adds to this feeling that this is like a live recording or some and yet again we get a track that sort of adds to this narrative that Kanye is just simultaneously somebody who is madly in love with his family but also just very disturbed emotionally which I think sort of comes to a head on the zero seven zero shake this is like a new sign II to good music oh I'm not that familiar with yet outside of the contribution that she had made to push a tease recent release but her singing on this track is absolutely chilling at the very end mostly because of her lyrics talking about how she needs to touch a hot stove to see if she still bleeds and there's no feeling and as a result of that she feels free which sort of goes to show how self-destructive somebody can be in their behavior when they feel invincible I see the closing track on here Violent Crimes is almost like the bound to of the album but instead of it being in ode to his love for his wife the relationship he has with her instead it focuses more on his and while Kanye is far and away from the first rapper to have a daughter and then that forces them to rethink their feelings on the fair sex and then they sort of put those emotions into song he certainly puts his own spin on it you could say elements of this track are kind of overprotective even patriarchal but I think Kanye is being more self-aware in this track than a lot of people might give him credit sort of reacting to what he says on this song right away without really diving deeper into his lyrics or his intentions I see the song is just kind of being a very smartly portrayed struggle internal struggle that Kanye is going to have with these feelings of having a daughter also the gorgeous lavish vocal harmonies on this thing sound great the chord progression is chilling and has a bit of a gospel vibe to it and all in all I just think it's a great ending to this very short release I mean even though yae seems like a pretty unorthodox release for yay I for the most part loved it I think it paints a really smart and vivid picture of his current state of self of his family ties and also his mental health but also I think this is going to be an album where two different camps of yay fans kind of split people who are fans of yay the person yay the artist are really going to enjoy what he delivers on this record but people who are more into his music for the image that he puts up in it for the illusions of grandeur that he delivers you are most likely going to be underwhelmed and sorely disappointed because on this album Kanye doesn't really try to be anything else other than the very broken troubled and conflicted person that he is simply titling this album yeah is incredibly fitting because listening to this feels like you're getting so close to the artist that it almost becomes awkward again depending on how you interpret this and whether or not you like the direction this is going in but if I haven't made this clear enough already I do I I do enjoy this direction of course there are a few moments where I think the rough production and very lightning in a bottle songwriting does kind of kneecap the full potential of a few tracks here and there are other spots on the album where I wish songs were longer or I just wish this overall were longer it almost seems like an injustice for an album tackling the very lofty and dense topics that this album is to just be twenty four minutes in length though I will say I do think it has a hell of a job of that and and actually sequences the songs very well so there's kind of a logical progression and flow to a lot of what Kanye is saying I also want to praise Kanye's lyricism on this thing sure he has his usual very tongue-in-cheek and playful and silly double entendre zand and word plays a few of my favorites being that nobody would be here without come line and also a that sentimental sent to mental bar was amazing but yeah biggest complaint about this thing is really that I just wanted more out of it I would love to hear more I would love to hear more but that being said highly impressed with the seven tracks that are on here to begin with so I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing transition did you give this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next

nerd and it's time for a review of the new Flatbush zombies album that vacation in hell this is the massive second album from trippy New York rap trio Flatbush zombies their second commercial LP and a follow-up to their somewhat underwhelming commercial debut a few years ago 3001 a laced Odyssey which was kind of an awkward transition away from the very psychedelic and grimy and hard-hitting mixtapes that the trio built their name on especially a better off dead amazing mixtape by comparison 3001 was so much more synthetic and hollow stiff didn't have the same explosive sample rich production didn't have that same kind of trippy density their mystical vibe and trademark voices and in group chemistry were mostly intact but just something was missing so I was kind of expecting vacation and held to be the album where the group would come into their own artistically and commercially and certainly on the surfaces seemed like that was going to be the case I mean this is definitely a bigger more ambitious record in track listing alone lots of pretty impressive features on the tracklist to the production in comparison with 3001 is definitely more interesting and sound rich the trio also effectively interpolates a number of different songs or sort of a musical references throughout some of these tracks and occasionally there's a bit of extra instrumentation or even a guest on this album such as Portugal the man who are incorporated very creatively into the track to the point where you have these very pretty gargantuan Indy style vocal harmony is sort of calling away in the instrumental as Flatbush zombies do their thing it's a pretty epic moment on the album a good centerpiece but with all that being said digging deeper into this album hearing the entire thing did not deliver the the non-stop excitement that I thought it would while this thing is 19 tracks it's 80 minutes long about it's not the longest album I've ever heard or listened to and yet for some reason it feels like it oh god I want I wanted to love this album so much especially since the teaser tracks for this thing where we're pretty good headstone you and I and also on paper Flatbush zombies just seemed like one of the most unique hip-hop groups out there right now but there are so many underwhelming deep cuts on this album and really I think it comes down to at the end of the day just Flatbush zombies punching under their weight on this LP and I guess just a lack of artistic progression as well because since their drugs and they're better off dead mixtapes there hasn't really been any growth in topical ambition in Flatbush zombies songs in lyrical cohesion between the members or across entire tracks save for maybe a few songs toward the end or a track about girls on this album plus I feel like the trio has passed this grace period where the novelty of their voices still kind of carries the entertainment value of the song like there has to be something a little bit more to what Flatbush zombies are doing if they're going to maintain interest over a longer period of time I feel like in a way on this album they've painted themselves into an artistic corner much in the same way that the underachievers did on their last LP because in a lot of ways I feel like I'm listening to a longer somewhat more instrumentally ambitious version of what I've heard before but a lot of this album sort of delivers this vague sense of depth and consciousness and and darkness that I feel like once you dive deeper into the lyrics isn't actually backed up I mean it's certainly present on some of the tracks here especially chunky where zombie juice goes at length inner verse about the negative portrayals of blacks in the media division and hatred on the internet kids essentially being raised with no moral compass but then there are tracks on this thing like big shrimp which it just seems like a competition to see who can have the least interesting verse it's just pretty much like some mystical auto-tune pop trap for a more mainstream audience that just doesn't really bring much in the way of substance to the table nor is it that interesting to listen to like the sounds are kind of average it's just passable and that's the case for a number of tracks on this album it would be one thing if there were maybe two or three maybe even four passable track sort of sliding through the tracklisting at various points on this album but the thing is the tracks that are just so-so are in clusters and all over the LP the song leather symphony features lyrics from juice talking about getting green and essentially turning into Peter Pan a simile that's definitely worth an eye roll or him rapping about his third eye just burning and again with with the third eye stuff not that I mind the idea of it or that I think it's bad to be referencing thinking at a higher consciousness level but most of the people who I see mentioning this over and over and over often aren't bringing the weightiest lyrics I mean you have a Sept 12 II on this track who easily had the most generic rap album of 2017 the song real girls follows a formula that many others on here do where you get a so-so Erik verse a so-so juice verse and then Meech does the hook accept a bun B actually shows up on this one buns verse on this track is is pretty general for him I mean I mean super general but he's not even the most lackluster appearance on the record sad to say that that might go to Denzel curry I mean I get what he was trying to do on this very sentimental very emotional very introspective and personal track it seems like he was trying to take it into into like a little bit of a romantic andre 3k kind of direction but these lyrics about like sweet diabetic hugs and kissing mistletoes well III just had a visceral just just you know indigestion kind of reaction to that the song ask Kourtney is yet another song on this record that despite a very potent Lee eerie vibe and these very clear references to the death of Kurt Cobain should have come out a lot more conceptual interesting and and morbid than it actually did in fact the the lyrics that are actually on this track they're pretty low impact sure zombie juices verse toward the end gives a real sense of paranoia but by that point it's really just kind of too little too late and then the song proxy why would the Flatbush zombies put such an uneventful song on a record whose chorus about faith and religion and holy war seems to have little to do with the verse that's around it a lot of these tracks just seem like there is a result of this stream of conscious writing style that doesn't really add up too much as it feels like a lot of what's being written hasn't been drafted much of what's on this album just seems like it's as a result of this stream of consciousness writing style that doesn't really add up into much thematically nor does it sound like a lot on this album has been drafted over and over again to the point where the verse itself stands out as being packed with wordplay or incredibly clever or saying something of significance or something even witty or clever or humorous or just kind of taking things at an angle that the listener hadn't thought of before I don't know sometimes I even hear moments on this record where the instrumentals fail to compliment the songs themselves even if Flatbush zombies are going kind of thematic which i think is certainly the case on the track trapped the instrumental on this song is super soulful it's pillowy it's cloudy it sounds like it should be the soundtrack to like a late-night hangout smoke session with your friends and yet like the tone of the lyrics you literally have Michi rapping about having suicidal thoughts on the song his verse is one of the darkest on the entire record and yet it doesn't really feel complimented by the sound palette of the beat and the flow of the album just seem is really odd as well again it's pretty long it starts off mildly then it gets more aggressive eventually mellows out gets sadder a few tracks later and then for whatever reason the tempo picks up again with some of the final tracks I mean I don't want to beat up on the album from beginning to end because there are some highlights on this thing I think best American all around is a pretty decent track and one of the more deeply political songs on the record even if a lot of the critiques or issues brought up our little surface-level the song headstone is one of the most irresistible catchy and groovy tracks on the entire record and one of the few moments on the album where it feels like Flatbush zombies are going a little commercial going a little bit poppier but it works me cheese hook on this track is pretty sweet and all the verses bring the typically slick and dark and dirty and and morbid tone that I usually enjoy out of an FB z song the song m.bison is another irresistible catchy track it's got some of the most pop and hook on the entire record some of the most head-bobbing flows the song vacation is one of the most mystical tracks on the entire album Joey badasses verse is pretty nice the song facts has some incredibly eerie production and I love the the shouted gang vocals on the hook seems really cartoony and over-the-top and brings a lot of character and personality to the song JT kisses verse on this track even though he's rapping at half the speed than a lot of the other people on the album his verse just has so much more presence it's so cold it's so deadly that Ace Hood line is hilarious crown with Portugal I already said it was a great track you and I already loved it as it was a teaser song to the album and maybe the best song in the last leg of the record is you are my sunshine which is essentially a lyrical tribute to ASAP yams from the heart from each goes over really well but despite all the tracks on this thing that I enjoy it's just not enough I feel like if this record were paired down a little bit it could have been so much more of a solid album but there are just too many lackluster or so-so songs in the tracklist for me to come out loving this album unfortunately vacation in hell is just a very bloated very inconsistent album as much as I do like the Flatbush zombies style and sound I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this one transition

"},{"id":"iBHjkRZQbv8","title":"Brockhampton - Saturation ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"[Music] hi everyone its Anthony Fantan oh here the internet sweatiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Brock Hampton project saturation Brock Hampton is a hip-hop outfit that was once based down in Texas I think they relocated to the internet or something I think they have seven members or nine members or 12 members or like 15 members not entirely sure oh it's it's I know I'm trying to be festive over here because this is a very good project and I did want to have the yellow flannel on here you know just to make a little appearance but it is hot it is very hot and I'm just going to be super unprofessional and wear my undershirt okay now if you weren't already aware there's some notable underground names already affiliated with the Brock Hampton project that is one Kevin abstract down McLennan both of whose solo material I have been aware of I have heard much of it admittedly more of Kevin's music has stuck with me than Dom's especially his American boyfriend project that dropped not too long ago a lot of fans and music writers hype up the fact that he is so open about his sexuality in his music is like this big selling point but I think what makes him unique as an artist runs much deeper than that just listen to American boyfriend and see for yourself I'm not going to talk too much about it here I'm just going to say make sure you've heard it if it slipped through the cracks for you because there are a lot of elements to that project a lot of ideas forged on that project that do show up in spades on saturation quite a bit there's actually one track the last track on the entire project waste which is this deeply melodic and passionate guitar ballad that would have fit snugly on American boyfriend and I think will remind some fans of cuts that were on Frank ocean's blond all that being said though there are other names affiliated with Brockhampton that you're going to get to know just because of how much talent they bring to the table on this thing just because of how much they steal the show on these tracks whether that be Java or net champion or Merlyn would or mere van just to name a few and this is not Brock Hamptons first rodeo either I remember first hearing about them back in 2015 when I heard that dirt single played on ebro's beats one show or whatever and I thought that single really hit hard it was a hard as nails track it was wild it was youthful it was off-the-wall it was crazy and then the subsequent mixtape all-american trash that the group dropped not too long after really underwhelmed there were some hard gritty tracks on there but much of the project I think was bogged down with a lot of impersonal slow burners that really took the wind out of the sails of the entire tape and I most likely would not have looked for another Brockhampton project ever again if it had not been for the fact that teasing up to saturation they released one fire single after another there was out a bad track promoting this album it was actually not a track that was not excellent promoting this album whether it be fake or gold or boys or heat or face or star it was just like non-stop fantastic tracks coming out with this much material you could risk spoiling the album experience once you actually hear the entire thing but you know going into this at least I thought I knew that I'm that most of it was going to be good but now that I have the entire thing in front of me this thing is 17 tracks it's 50 minutes and there's only like a couple skits and you know all American trash did have a few duds on it so I'm coming to this thinking is Brock Hampton going to consistently deliver great material for the entire e of this thing somehow they do shockingly this up-and-coming group has delivered one of the most consistent rap projects I've heard this year consistent in terms of quality this thing is wall-to-wall creative colorful visceral bouncy sweet catchy hard production and the music they create on this thing runs deeper than rap like that's on waste that I mentioned earlier the song swim is this dreamy serene kind of sensual auto-tune ballad that is beautiful it's feel-good I love the distant tones whaling way in the background very faintly they kind of sound like horns kind of I'm not saying they are but they're very beautiful I love the sentiment of the track too coming through in the lyrics and the vocal effects don't exactly take away from the emotional performance of the singing either the string sections that were worked into the song cache various points are gorgeous as well the song bump is easily one of the biggest bangers on the entire record but the hook is very unique because it features kind of a breakdown a breakaway every piece of instrumentation melts or disappears just so we can hear this one lonely tiny guitar line with Kevin abstract singing over it he takes on most of the song hooks if not all of them on the entire project he sings very well but match with this guitar line it's almost like I'm hearing some kind of sad angsty guy alt-rock from the 90s or something and that's not the only point on the album where the group seems to pull some very clear influence from rock music ten to twenty years ago the song milk might have a sequence beat and other fundamentals of hip hop production worked into the instrumental but the lyrics and the vocal melody sounds like I'm listening to the limitations of some kind of 2000 Zehra emo band singing about struggling to be yourself and wishing you had a friend you just kind of hang out with and be on the couch with there might not be an overall scheme or theme to this album or whether it be conceptually or lyrically or even musically sometimes but again I think in terms of quality song quality production quality lyrical quality every song is so high there are a few tracks on the back end that feel kind of way out in terms of musical style and stick out like a sore thumb a little bit but even these songs for me are not really skippable there's so much great material on here and I haven't even gotten to the core tracks yet like the opener heat I really don't know what to praise about this track first the insane aggressive in-your-face off the wall animalistic verses and rapping throughout the track or the instrumental which features this clunky heavy drumbeat that just knocks this fuzzy somewhat distorted bass line and on the hook this wall of shrill ear piercing noise and sinister melodies like flies in and creates this loschen of sonic mayhem the song gold is much lighter and smoother and catchy er by comparison kevin's hook on this thing is one of the best on the entire project keep a gun chained on my neck sighs again boy I bet a trim you ever spent Brockhampton here effectively proves that they could dial it back from 11 to a very chill laid-back 5 but still come through the track that's very sticky has a lot of personality a lot of character in a good sense of humor to the song star features all of these hilarious pop-culture references from music to movies and so on and so forth Kevin abstracts verse toward the back end cleans up shop and is a little more personal in the previous two talking about how he needs to get his teeth fixed and his association with Vice Land the beat on this thing is a nocturnal trunk knocker that segues seamlessly in the next track boys the following track Tupac might just be like a bit of a one-minute instrumental but it's still one of the most emotionally compelling song within the entire album Brockhampton isn't just dropping aggressive bangers on here they are very versatile group they are great at dropping those aggressive and kind of mid paced tracks though because these guys go into each track with a lot of chemistry lyrically they play off of each other so well and extrapolate fantastically on whatever flow that they have chosen on a track it gives each song a lot of momentum to the point where they don't even really need to go into a track with so much in the way of a super strong lyrical topic or concept for it to be entertaining case in point Bank case in point fake not to mention the fact that the forward-thinking production and quality hooks also add to the winning mix of these songs but to get back to my earlier point about sad songs on this thing these guys don't just drop bangers their real moments of personal turmoil on here they're really introspective tracks that seemed to reflect at least a little bit on the current political and social state of America being yourself loneliness struggling through a thankless and unforgiving economy love being unsure of your future in a way Brock Hampton more than any of their contemporaries I think has embodied the woes of the average millennial and they've done it without making an album or making a project that is overly political or is like Trump Trump Trump we don't like Donald Trump yeah I mean I assume that and my point here about these woes embodying them is especially true when you consider that the last gang of young upstarts rabble rousers to take the rap game by storm was Odd Future whose rage just kind of turned out to be a phase fueled by their teenage angst and I'm not saying that as a slight against odd feature or as a slight against Brockhampton but I can't help but feel like listen to this as much as I enjoy it I feel like I'm almost listening to an odd future for people who went to college or graduated college because I feel like Brock Hampton in a way is delivering what so many music writers and fans had banked on odd future doing as a collective delivering these perfectly crafted energetic crazy forward thinking ahead of the curve posse tracks with each member having their own distinct personality with each member functioning on a similarly high level of talent Odd Future unfortunately as a collective did not do that that's not to say that they weren't an incredibly influential group and that they didn't have talent at their disposal I just thought each member saw more artistic success individually than they did as a group because Tyler has come out with his solid projects so his Earl Sol has said I don't mean to turn this whole review into an odd feature conversation but I can't help but feel like they kind of set the foundation for what Brock Hampton is doing here on this project I mean certainly there are a lot of verses on here that I think give off a little bit of an earl vibe Brock Hampton though seems to gel in a way that no other group their size has in a long time which is what makes this album so electrifying because the quality of the songs here again is so fantastically consistent you have so much diversity across the album in terms of emotion musical style the personalities and lyrical styles of each member also the producers on this thing bring an incredibly large amount of talent and creativity to the table too and this thing is so dense and detailed in terms of each verse each be what each member is overall adding to this project individually as much as I have talked about this project I feel like I've only sort of scratched the surface of what makes this thing so good so I mean I'm just going to leave it here and say this is fantastic sure you listen to this it's an excellent project and I am feeling a light nine on it transition have you given saturation to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which guy are you next to like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry though I don't see

a review of this new Nicki mini-album Zephyr this is the debut mini-album of singer-songwriter recent 88 rising signing Nicki aka Nicole's afonya it is a short 25 minutes and 8 tracks but a very promising start to a hopefully successful career in pop and R&B even though Zephyr is of a meagre size it is still a project that showcases some thoughtful songwriting quality vocals tasteful production a very sensual vibe as well as a mix of classic and contemporary R&B sounds the song news flash is an excellent start to the record kind of feels like instrumentally a mix of Amy Winehouse some Norah Jones with lots of rich pianos and very crisp sequence drums vintage horn hits sassy lead vocals delivering lyrics about shutting down this guy who she sees as kind of being out of her league not to mention in her description he seems like a little bit of a d-bag kind of like a pickup artist type even though Nicki feels like an artist who kind of wears her influences on her sleeve from the start of this project she still has quite a bit of personality on this cut not only through the singing and lead vocals but with some of the more playful and ad-lib e vocal bits that pop up here and there the transition the song from one section to another also that hook like when the horns burst in and go be someone else's it's just an impeccable start to this thing a great introduction to a new artist overall if you only listen to one single song off of this project make sure it's this one Nicki then takes things into slightly more sensual territory with say my name sonically while it is one of the softer tracks on this thing its intentions are some of the most animalistic with Nicki going as far as to tell her man on the track to shut the fuck up and close the tour there's a real element of tension and lyrics on this track like her and this guy just kind of got through arguing but she kind of wants to get back to that moment where their relationship is in a state of bliss strictly in the physical sense in in this instance it's not a bad tune either though I will say the production on this cut is a little bit more contemporary and a tad bland these song friends seems almost like a track that's stereotypically I would hear like a Kalani or asses on top of basically singing about making this mistake of getting to physical or to intimate with a guy and now you sort of regret it and wish you would just remain friends the hook pops but I wish it lasted just a little bit longer while the verses kind of feel like these musical internal ramblings of all the downsides of this decision that she's made and even though the subject matter of this track is pretty awkward it's undeniably one of the cuter songs on the entire project then there is the very dramatic and spacious spells which feels like a euphoric dream their distant shimmering pianos on this thing and gellick background vocals this very subtle puttering track beat which I wasn't all that crazy about at first but it has kind of warmed up to me it doesn't really overtake the song that much Nicki not only wins me over with some of the lyrical bright spots on this track like even though this person doesn't believe in heaven she's going to love them till it hurts like hell but also she delivers what's easily one of the most emotional vocal performances on the entire project - between the good song and the beautiful vocals and the instrumentation on this track it feels almost unfair to critique or review it because I'm really just being seduced on this song I'm kind of powerless against it the moment when she's singing about God breaking this spell certainly seems apt given that the song feels like a lovesick trance the song vintage feels like an old-school 90s era pop and R&B blend with this bustling be bright ringing synth chords very nimble vocal leads and harmonies I don't know if it's the tune or the chords or the beat but there's just something about the song that feels eerily similar to that ghost town DJ's song my boo meanwhile the lyrics tell this story of falling back in love with someone who you used to be in a relationship with so that relationship that connection it's it's vintage and even though you had this falling out you kind of forget why the relationship ended and getting back together with that person feels kind of easy it's sort of like familiar territory it's after this track though or I feel like the the mini record here starts to falter a bit the song dancing with the devil doesn't have the sharpest tune on the record though I will admit it is a high point on the album when Nicki busts out with that God I'm so gone line the song pools is yet another very Spacey glassy ballad I feel like she did this aesthetic better on spell though not only that but the track seems to have like a similar descending vocal melody that just has too many eerie similarities to it just kind of feels like a redundant moment in the tracklisting overall and the very somber and simple vocal piano combo at the very finish of this thing shows that Nicky works pretty well in an intimate context as well even though I wouldn't say this record sticks to the landing I still think it's a relatively solid effort and even though it's not exactly cutting edge when it comes to the genres the Nicky's playing and there are still a lot of great performances and good singing and quality writing and classy instrumentation on this thing it seems like Nicky has a lot going for her right out of the gate I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing

ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"the vaccines what did you expect from the vaccines hi everyone you have any Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review almond milk power on we're doing a review of the latest LP from the latest sensation to come out of the UK The Vaccines I am totally surprised that name wasn't taken already their debut LP is titled what did you expect from the vaccine now in my last review the holy ghost album I hope you watched it if you didn't go back and do so I talked a little bit about how a lot of today's music is derivative or you know just copying another idea borrowing from somewhere else more derivative than you may think and how something being completely original doesn't necessarily make music great and something being kind of unoriginal or just really influenced by other things doesn't necessarily make an album bad and if you're a fan of the Jesus and Mary Chain The Ramones The Strokes and even Interpol chances are the vaccines are not going to pioneer any new ground in your brain but they do offer a really gutsy noisy straightforwardness that you may feel is missing from a lot of music today the opener on this LP record bar rah-rah-rah is about as to-the-point as The Ramones blitzkrieg bop all you need to do is switch out a hill let's go with rah-rah-rah and with the guitar and the vocals just soaked in atmospheric reverb this thing kind of comes off sounding like in upbeat b-side from unknown pleasures that we just never heard because you know wasn't as depressing to the rest of the album I love that that track is short and sweet just like BAM but these guys really do lay on the hooks to like if you wanna that track is basically candy for the ears lots of lyrics about rekindling a dead relationship put on a pedestal of just noisy guitars exploding with the same reverb that was on wrecking bar and pretty much every other track of this album the opening bass line on the lack of understanding really like a pixie song while the vocals had this very strokes s croon to them very sentimental singing there is definitely a bit of a borrowed feeling in the sound of this LP which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if I didn't feel like I've heard some of these chord progressions like a million times before the chords used in the Khorasan blow it up I know and you know we have heard before and also I've been reading a lot of comments on the track one of the first singles to drop from this LP post-breakup sex which some people are likening to the Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark song and Ola gay and I've heard both tunes and yeah I agree they have a similar chord progression those guys are from the UK as well maybe they're an influence but I think going out and just calling The Vaccines a ripoff is a little bit like jumping the gun do you know how often the chord progression in that song has been used we've got an F major got a D minor and then we've got a b-flat major Hennessy major post breakup sex post breakup sex what did you expect from post breakup sex she went up wait for the holiday she said she's going to and they she never got there she never got them she never got there they say yeah baby baby baby oh yeah baby baby baby oh yeah baby baby baby oh I know I always be this chord progression has been in use in popular music long before OMG and the Ramones were even around so it's not that the music here is a ripoff it's just been around the block a little that's all and that's pretty much how I feel about many of the songs here they sound really close to what I love but they're not really what I love it's the sound and the simple and well-traveled songs and chord progressions that kind of make this thing instantly enjoyable and instantly accessible it's almost like it's too easy to like like I've been given a baseball bat and the ball was put on a tee right in front of me when I would really prefer it to be pitched to me even if I do end up you know striking out the first couple times to me it's just a fun rock record with a lot of effects but also kind of in one ear and out the other it kind of reminds me of that Best Coast LP that came out last year it might not sound that amazing now but save it until June this thing would be perfect for a road trip so I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP I know people freak out and they're like oh of you if you give it a six that means you hate it no I liked it while it was on it's just kind of not something I'm gonna revisit anytime soon that's all so what do you think of this LP love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next The Vaccines what did you expect from them forever "},{"id":"WxY7yOmZs4w","title":"Lorde - Melodrama ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi hi everyone best need teeth tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lord Alba melodrama Lorde is a New Zealand pop singer and songwriter who hit it huge off of some breakout tracks from her debut EP of the love club EP specifically the song Royals when Lord started turning heads in 2013 she was an exciting new voice in the world of pop music but the start of her career was very much obviously that of an artist who wasn't planning on becoming an overnight sensation because the sudden rush of attention thanks to the track Royals created this instant demand for more music by the summer we were hit with the tennis court EP and then later in the fall her debut album pure heroine which contained highlights from the previous EPS including Royals and I get that Lorde and her label were doing their best to take advantage of the first year of hype behind her music but the finished product on pure heroine was a little rushed it sounded like a loose collection of tracks that were just too uniform and sound to skeletal too basic too simple to really work as a full record and despite the fact that I saw quite a bit of potential in her singing in her voice in her style she did kind of come off like a one-trick pony which is unfortunate because I thought most of her songs at least the best songs off of this album sounded incredibly mature considering what age she was when she wrote and recorded them and that it would be great to hear whatever she had to offer several years into the future when she had improved her skills at songwriting and performing and here we are several years into the future brand new album melodrama which was teased toured with a handful of singles the biggest of which has easily been the song green light which is kind of funny considering that is maybe my least favorite of all the singles on this record mostly because it feels like kind of a disappointing departure from what made Lords music appealing to me in the first place the stark minimal beat driven instrumentals the very dramatic vocal performances essentially finding power in simplicity which is certainly the case for the introduction of the track but it does not take long for the song to start introducing these four to the floor kick drums and these very very dance music friendly piano chords ten tenten tenten tenten tenten tenten there's some zany vocal harmonies happening in the background at some points the track for me for a lord song it just kind of feels overkill the lead vocals which are really the selling point to me in Lords music just feel like they have less prominence they're sort of awkward place especially as this dance kick drum starts going and immediately Lord starts writing herself a little out of her vocal range with a low point in her singing all these sounds in the bond that final note there being one that she grazes more than she hits I'm similarly cold on the song sober the track seems to build up a lot of tension with these subtle verses and a very cerebral beat and this tension is never really quite resolved even on the hook even on the groovy beats which up toward the end of the track even with some of the steamy horns where the record really gets going for me is on the song homemade dynamite it's a track that's really coy and playful and built upon the strengths that I think made Lords music great to begin with but now they're elevated with better production better since cool little weird experimental synth embellishments and a very soft breathy but incredibly sticky hook to dynamite things also get playfully cute on the song to do a song that features the soft but driving guitars that take us through these endearing lyrics about a young love figuring itself out and again the lyrics a little flirty talking about how we're so great that they'll hang us in the Louvre in the back but still the Louvre and the hook the refrain on this thing is actually pretty funny to the broadcast boom boom boom boom and make them all dance to it the production at this point gets all kind of distorted and overblown I kind of like the sound play here definitely a bit weirder and off the beaten path than I would expect a top 40 pop record to be and the sound change here is huge it's totally different it's a big stark contrast from what the verses are doing with the guitar and the vocal melody but even so it works this is the kind of experimentation these are the kinds of surprises that I was looking forward to hearing this record and I'm getting them and I love it the song liability is a passionate and intimate piano ballad that I was deeply impressed with going into this album and in the context of the tracklist I still think it sounds amazing the simple piano and vocal combo is great but it's really about the lyrics on the song which is pretty funny now that I think about it because if I recall correctly I was not all that impressed with some of the lyrics on pure heroin I went away from that record hoping and sort of crossing my fingers that lourd would progress further on that record that she would mature a little bit lyrically and get a bit more adventurous a bit more intimate a bit more detailed and what she's singing about and that's definitely the case especially on this track where she is singing about sort of the position that her fame puts her in making her a difficult lover a difficult friend because you know sort of being in that limelight once people in your life family whoever be is also in that limelight with you just by nature of being with you being connected to you by blood or by love you become sort of a liability it sort of makes life kind of weird as she says people pull back they make other plans it's a really interesting take on the way that Fame can impact a relationship an interesting angle not only for her but for pop music in general I'm equally wowed by the recreation of the rush of memories that hit you when you think about an old relationship that you you know have a lot of sentimental feelings about on the track supercut there's something kind of anthemic 80s arena pop arena rock about the way the song is built up that I like a lot it's awesome to sort of hear this style of music ring so true in Lords music not only because I think she does it justice but it's kind of a aha moment for me like of course like this sort of music of course this sound would be such a huge inspiration to not only what you do on this record but earlier on in your career too Lord seems to be lamenting the death of the same relationship on the track writer in the dark where what really makes this tracks out for me is that there is a sudden vocal change on this track where she goes into her upper register and hits this inflection that has a very very Kate Bush sort of tone to it there's a vil strings here some sad simple piano chords and I like the passion in her voice I love sort of how cracked and sad and depressing it sounds and with even funnier as the song is about how the guy who she used to be with I bet he's regretting the fact that he kissed a writer kissed a songwriter kissed an artist a creator because now I'm writing all these songs about him and now everybody is hearing all these songs and our relationship is kind of being put on blast certainly more self-aware than a Taylor Swift who will just continually pump out song about shattered relationships like she's a human assembly line but as long as Lorde is being a little self aware about this I wish she kind of took it another step further because in the internet age in the Information Age other artists rapping or singing about their exes can be kind of odd because the moment that one of them does instantaneously loads of gossip sites troll the internet do their research and sometimes they find out who these people are and post articles about them which in a way can be kind of I don't know embarrassing or as I said before abusive even if the relationship did kind of end on bad terms but to get back on track I love the very heavy and intoxicating hard feelings which features an odd instrumental with a bridge that has all these shrill loud metallic tones sort of battling it out over the instrumental that I feel like almost like I'm listening to poltergeist yell at each other I should probably stress here that this is a really odd thing to happen on such a big big pop record while again there are some songs where Lord is obviously making some top 40 concessions there are quite a few tracks here still where weird stuff like this occurs and not only does it sound really interesting it sounds beautiful and it sounds exciting I'm so happy to hear that Lord is continuing to take musical and sonic risks in her music while still delivering an album that overall is pretty accessible now there are a few reprises on the album where she references back to previous tracks of the songs over to as well as the liability reprieves toward the end of the album which is something that I like on this record it says to me that Lorde is thinking of this entire album as a continually flowing as a linear experience not simply just a collection of tracks even if I do think some of the weird trap percussion on the song sober - is kind of off however the clothes are perfect places might be my least favorite song on the entire record to me it seems like this track is just trying way too hard to define a generation as it were by making partying sounds super deep and serious as well as trying to deliver this huge just mountainous but also very empty oversized chorus that invites everyone in to not only sing but think of themselves and everyone else listening to this song and everyone else is a part of this millennial generation just one big collective where we we all love each other maybe I'm taking that a little too far but the instrumentation is kind of overkill especially for a tune that isn't really that significant in Lords Canon and the beat Christ I mean it's just a deja vu of another beat of pure heroin maybe I'm taking that a little too far but the song really does epitomize the the title of the album melodrama and not in the best way however despite the weak moments at the very start in the very end of the record I think this is a really solid pop album certainly a sign of maturity and growth past her sudden appearance in the spotlight several years ago Lorde seems really be growing into her sound growing into her voice growing into her style and expanding upon it - and at this point based on what I've heard on this record it sounds like she has many more solid records to come I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on

of this new Weezer album White Album The White Album Weezer long-running California power pop and alternative rock band and this is their tenth full-length studio album which I've been looking forward to for a couple of different reasons one there were great singles and teaser tracks to this album la girls and thank God for girls and I actually think the band has slowly been on a progression of making some better music now we all know that the 2000s were a pretty dark time for the Weezer catalog numerous awful Weezer albums were released around this time and the band was just kind of sweetening their sound to the point where it was just completely beyond consumption there were like a handful of decent tracks on Hurley and I also not everything will be alright that that record was actually relatively solid in my opinion and now the White Album is here and it is their most consistent album in years so consistent and so good that it actually makes me bitter why why did this happen because it's not like Weezer are reinventing themselves on this album or trying anything like radically new here they're just kind of sticking to their guns once again but this time they just happen to be on target but then I have to kind of remind myself that Weezer came through and were popular in the mid in late 90s and since then the music industry has gone through a really awkward phase the traditional media outlets that Weezer was born out of are no longer really relevant when it comes to music discovery at least for the target audience that Weezer typically would reach the introspective type the rock music fan they're just not going to look for new music on Anthony or on MTV anymore so now we xur doesn't really have the pressure to come out with a raid single or an ultra sugary album that's going to be competing with every other radio hit out there on the market now they have to compete on the democratized internet with a legitimately solid album and I think they did it they did it not only just by putting together one good song after another but in a way kind of pulling from their glory days in the 90s with a little touch of some Californian sunshine pop music from the 1960s as I was listening to this record with my buddy max he actually pointed out that the lead melody of the song a good thing along with the chord progression actually resembles quite a bit Lee Rascals song it's beautiful mone it booty dude and there's a ton of Beach Boys influence on this record as well now there are 10 tracks on this album most of them end at the 3 minute and 30 second mark which only further proves that Weezer just has this music here down to a science a summary angsty science the opening track California kids lyrically it might be a little bit of an over exaggeration as to how willing the California kids will help you if you are in trouble but it's still a fiery anthem and a wonderful tribute in a really catchy song with soaring siren guitar leads riding on top of these punching just pounding and confident guitar chords there are a lot of anthemic and triumphant spots on this record but this album has a dark side to which you might have already guessed which comes through on tracks like thank God for girls this is one of a handful of cuts on this record where piano so it's pretty prominently in the mix not just those roaring Weezer guitars and thank God for girls is a single that I like even more in the context of this album than I did just like it by itself the chorus on this thing just ruptures with pent-up sadness and anger over unrequited love and rivers as our songwriting protagonist here kind of falling short of that alpha male archetype Rivers is just still chained handling so well those emotions that come from adolescent and awkward teenage love well into his 40s and it just works and I'm sure that he and every other Weezer fan that's still out there enjoys or maybe is even angered by the irony of a song like la girls where Rivers is essentially pleading with these la girls to act their age when he's just completely unwilling to do the same but you cannot deny that that is a fantastically catchy track and one of the many songs on here where the Ballad underneath these heavy again Weezer alternative rock guitars it just feels like a song much older than the recording we're actually hearing much older than even the 90s that Weezer were born out of hey girls please act your age but back to this thank God for girls track I do like some of the weird religious undertones that pop up in the lyrics on this track there's a lot to this song I think it's one of the better tunes that Weezer has come out with in a while and there are other cuts on here that are great songs too and they are equally Moody or a little bit edgy like on the song do you want to get high or on the track jacked up I think this is the saddest Weezer's been sounding since Pinkerton with the dying flowers and these strained falsettos that definitely calls back to that era and it does a great job of it and there's some irresistible sweet songs in the tracklisting here that may be a little too cute at times but I do think they're still very enjoyable to me even just in general the worst songs in the tracklisting here are pretty good there's not one song on here that I want to skip so good thing of course that track is very sunny it's very upbeat it's very sweet it's just about being in the midst of a blissful love affair and then with the song endless summer hey hey hey hey it's a little acoustic closer for the album that feels really good it's really warm finish but one track I do want to specifically highlight before I get out of this review is the song king of the world not only is this one of the best courses Weezer's come through with a while but it's also one of the most adult and lyrically telling songs I think Rivers Cuomo has written or at least put onto a Weezer album in a long time - he seems to be singing about his wife and not only his wife's childhood but his wife's emotions and how if he were king of the world or if he had control over this kind of thing that she wouldn't shed a tear she wouldn't be sad unless she really wanted to be it's about somebody who from rivers perspective really understands emotional pain and wants to be the bearer of that pain for somebody who he really cares about so while in a sense it is a very sad song and it does have some very strong personal details in there it's it's also a track that is shrouded musically and vocally in that same youthful hope and idealism that most Weezer songs are as I said earlier that song good thing is a little too sweet for my taste just just a little bit but again not a terrible song and the track some are Elaine and drunk Dori didn't really stand out to me just to really seem to have as strong a lyrical narrative behind it as many other tracks here did and really that's it for like low lights for me on this album this album is consistently highlights I mean even again this drunk Dory track has a great melody to it that I still find myself singing along to on the chorus ever since this album dropped I've been consistently coming back to it again and again and again and even as I was listening to it more times than I normally would if I were just reviewing it I didn't really feel like I was reviewing it I was just putting it on to enjoy it I wasn't even you know in the forefront of my mind in the way that I would be critically analyzing the album bah bah bah bah bah because after a while I just kind of realized man there's really nothing that bad about this record there's nothing I have to harshly critique about this album I can just sit back and just listen to this thing without worrying about you know oh where are the tracks I want to skip what are the bad parts what are the so boy here comes this track I hate this moment it's just a super great pop rock album it just comes through with great music without doing anything too experimental or too pretentious or - weird or difficult to digest or anything that needs a whole lot of explaining anything all I really feel like I'm doing coming on camera here is saying to you guys that confirmed this is a very great Weezer album and this is the greatest thing they've done in a long time again makes me slightly mad that it didn't come out earlier or that the band hasn't been this consistent up until this point because even in Weezer's darkest days I've always felt like this album was within their potential later is better than never I guess I'm feeling a strong a - la9 on this project transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you die best u2 best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you might die anthony Fantana Weezer that white album very pretty "},{"id":"nPP1YYoNNAo","title":"Hot Chip - Why Make Sense? ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"uh-huh got you again hi everyone um last video we'll be doing from the UH from the hotel where you know we're gonna be back at it with the next video your the best time for a review of the new hot ship record why makes sense Hot Chip is a uk-based synth-pop and alternative dance electronic music group they have been at it for many years now they have the albums to show for it I love a lot of their early stuff they came off recently of a couple pretty mild records but they really came back on their last full-length album their 2012 LP out of our heads even though this wasn't really uh that edgy or cutting of a record I think Hot Chip really came through with just some really great accessible memorable sticky pop songwriting with some very smooth colorful synthetic production and I don't know looking at this new LP I'm not really sure what I was expecting wasn't really anticipating any kind of big moves or changes from Hot Chip stylistically I guess I was just kind of hoping for a another good Hot Chip album but in fact Hot Chip actually does deliver a pretty significant change of pace on this record which is apparent right from the first few tracks hurrah chi-lites and love is the future not only do these songs have just driving beats behind them very influenced by house music which while Hot Chip does have some very strong electronic music influences in their music I can't say that they have embraced it so strongly here and usually there is a pretty strong song at the core of a Hot Chip track and not to say that isn't the the case with these two tracks here but it seems really that the the dance beats kind of take control a little bit and really propel the song really kind of become the main attractions of these tracks another thing that's kind of strange for these tracks are the just out of place vocal features actually if it wasn't for these features I think these would be fantastic songs from the giant over the top female vocals to the incredibly awkward just out of nowhere rap verse on unloved is the future the it's just it just does not complement Hot Chip style however many of the other characteristics of these tracks sound great especially the robotic craft work sort of Daft Punk like refrains on hurrah chi-lites again if it wasn't for these vocal features I think these two tracks would have kicked this album off to a great start for me Hot Chip has always had this kind of nerdy shy demeanor when it's come to electronic music since pop and dance music and I think that they don't really have the the swagger to kind of pull these vocal experiments experimental for them off even on the song started right which has these just very toned down talk sung vocals that seem kind of chromeo esque Hot Chip doesn't really have the kind of just sensuality or the charisma to pull such a thing off and for it to actually you know hey and I definitely get that desire that Hot Chip has to sort of change things up a little bit vocally on this album because vocals have never really been a strong point of hot chips not that they're awful awful awful but you know it's it's not like there's an incredible amount of vocal range on Hot Chip songs usually the vocals are you know pretty easy on the ears very shy like I was saying before about their music and their way of songwriting in general in comparison with most synth pop and alternative dance music and here I feel like they're just taking some vocal risks that don't really totally pay off either that or the vocals are so underwhelming and so reserved especially on the more just subtle tone down ballots here that I don't really think they convey that much emotion like on the track so much further to go or the lyrically questionable white wine and fried chicken I mean III guess in a sense this record does live up to its title because it feels like Hot Chip is making a smoother quieter more synthetic record with stronger house influences and some vocal experiments and risks that really don't make that much sense but I do admit that I did like what the band was doing on the song I need you now with the again that we had this return of these giant over-the-top female vocals I totally felt like this 90s or sort of early 2000s house jam but with a much subtler B and these kind of I guess I guess droney sort of walls of these swelling just pulsating synthesizers that reminded me quite a bit of John Hopkins last full-length LP songwriting wise it's good and I like the instrumental as well and there's some other highlights in the track listing for me here too I like the song Dark Knight this is another sort of more house influenced track here I like how Hot Chip when they're approaching house music it doesn't feel like they are just passionless Lee following a formula you know there's there's quite a bit of humanity and soul and I think vulnerability in sort of the the softer approach that Hot Chip takes so you know that there is that upside then there is the song cry for you which has a really kind of sweet little funky devilish groove that's fantastic and then easy to get really one of the better ballads Hot Chip has ever written I mean it does have a pretty strong dance beat but it's a bit of a tale of love or maybe even I guess just lust or wanting to be with somebody and the dance floor again one of hot chips better songs hands down and then there is the climactic closer on here which has these just layers and layers of synthesizers from these sort of walls of chords to these bubbling arpeggios and just a really sharp crisp booming drumbeat which actually makes this song stand out a little more energetically than a lot of other tracks on here and this track also features this huge ascending intense chord progression it's it's definitely one of the more vibrant moments on the LP PPU one of the more explosive moments on the LP and even though this record was a bit of a rocky road for me I mean it at least it and did strong so with this record I mean I'm kind of torn in a sense I am a hot ship fan but there were just some ideas and and risks they took on this album that I think didn't really pay off sounded silly fell out of place especially that that rap verse which again is is maybe one of the most unlikable decisions Hot Chip is made on a song in a long time and not that it was sort of inherently a bad idea to have a rap verse it's just that this particular rap verse not good if you're you're morbidly curious about it you know give it a try but the good then again I did like the way that the band approached house music and just had a more overtly electronic sound on this album I think that worked out well for them I just think maybe a third or maybe even a half of the other things that they sort of try on this record didn't really work out for them I think there are some decent songs in the track listing here but either they're kind of complemented with sort of bland unmemorable instrumentals here and there or again you know just some some vocal ideas that aren't that fantastic so you know it's it's it's like I'm faced with a record that isn't entirely bad but it isn't entirely great either even the songs that I I dislike the most at least had an element of something I think are great and even the songs that I love maybe I'm just not so head over heels for them that I think they're perfect so yeah you know really I'm feeling like a decent strong six on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yeah Anthony Phan tanto Hot Chip why make sense forever "},{"id":"L-ZQEUZxtZM","title":"Preoccupations - Self-Titled ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hey everyone four thinly stretched Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled preoccupations record this is the latest full-length album from Canadian band preoccupations fresh off the name change wasn't too long ago that they dropped a record under the name Viacom which the band was known as until some people got triggered and now they're back with a new record I was pretty excited to hear not only because this band is essentially a phoenix that rose out of the ashes of one of my favorite Canadian bands women but also I enjoyed their last record quite a bit and I thought the teaser tracks leading up to this new record we're pretty good they forecast a much darker release for preoccupations this time around not so much the reverb II washed out indie vibe that I got from their last record something that was a little bit noisier more textured and kind of depressing I think the band sounds a little more upfront this time as well not so much like you're listening to some group play at the end of a distant cavern or something the drums and bass especially are very up close up front and center very meaty very punchy and there's a really prominent since throughout this record as well which enhance the very dark moody tone of the music reminds me quite a bit of some of the darker groups to come out of the new wave and post-punk move and artists like Bauhaus and maybe a little a cure but even though a lot of these tracks are pretty straightforward as far as riffs and grooves go it can be kind of difficult to read the emotional tone of this album it's kind of unsettling or just like purposefully obscure the emotional intentions of the music that is a lot of the time preoccupations come off colder than a cadaver on this thing which is a quality I have enjoyed about this band since the days of women but preoccupations sort of bring that same vibe but they played a little more aggressive on this record with the guitars the bass and drums the tight grooves and bright guitar melodies on the song stimulation make for one of the catchiest moments on the entire record and the driving bass and glistening synth leads on the song degraded are pretty sticky too the band isn't afraid to go despondent on this record either though like on the song forbidden which is one of the shorter cuts on the record strangely enough it just kind of fades out just as it seems like the drums and bass are starting to bring the song somewhere but still this track features some of the most off-putting and surreal lyrics on the entire record at some very dreary melodies to enhance those lyrics to also the very texture drone at the end of the song memory is as heavy as it is sad and the song anxiety gives the entire album a very odd and depressing start with its deep wavy synths its percussion that sounds like these very flat just aggressive thuds the song does deliver a very pretty synth lead on the hook though that kind of sweetens the deal and makes the song almost digestible and a little bit of Joy Division influence resurfaces in the band's music once again on the song monotony namely with the lead guitars and the lead synth melodies on the track just feel like really pulled out of the new order Joy Division playbook but the band seems to channel this influence in a very tasteful way and kind of make it their own and I would say that's the case for all of preoccupations influences generally though many of them do seem to be coming from the post-punk era with a touch of noise rock and some indie mixed in there too like more dramatic acts such as Wolf Parade seem to be a massive influence the band's strange approach to sound and texture as well as some of the odds song structures and album flow definitely set them apart as an act on their own and while we're talking about album flow there are many tracks on this record that actually segue into one another but somehow the band still manages to come together with a record that almost moves from moment to moment very awkwardly and I'm sure it's kind of intentional because it feels like the album every few tracks or so like resets in a way interrupting the emotional maturity or emotional progression of the record by shifting in weird unpredictable ways still though the band does deliver a transition that is so smooth going into the track zodiac that if I wasn't paying attention to the tracklist I would just think it's an extension of the same song I had been listening to I also loved the noisy guitar strumming on this track that sort of pads out some of the verses to give us kind of a weird noisy musical passage some of the psychedelic scents and throbbing electronics on this track are pretty cool too not to mention that this track has one of the most dramatic and in-your-face vocal performances on the entire record as well the entire album finishes off with the very ghostly and haunting fever which features these sci-fi flavored synth leads it's it's strange man like in the band is kind of delivering a strange groove that I wasn't expecting on the next track or a different vocal delivery or it seems like the guitars or the sense are taking on a different tone entirely sometimes kind of noisy and abstract and experimental sometimes kind of punky sometimes kind of indie and then I get something that sounds like it's straight out of like an 80s spaceship movie soundtrack and even though again the flow of the record is really weird and doesn't make all that much sense sometimes especially as the band is delivering an 11-minute track out of nowhere to one-minute tracks out of nowhere I still actually came away from this record pretty entertained and very impressed by what each track was delivering individually at least and I remember feeling slightly the same way about the band's last record it almost felt unfinished in a way and I feel like I'm almost left with a cliffhanger this time around as well but in the case of this latest album over here it feels like it adds to the perfectly weird and unsettling character of the record so much I'm not really seeing the massive wave of hype that I've been seeing some people throw onto this record you know I think preoccupations do tend to kind of where their influences on their sleeves and there are a few moments on here that do pale in comparison to others and while I do appreciate the odd sequencing of this record I probably would have been more fulfilled by a record that had a more logical progression to it but still I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing we're thing we're thing really impressed with the performances the writing the production the texture the sounds the band's eccentric tendencies and the emotional flavor of this album I'm hoping you guys are enjoying this thing as much as I am I think I'm just gonna get out of here and transition have you given

nerd thank you for watching and it's time it's time for a review of the new shellac record dude incredible this is the latest full-length LP from famed underground rock outfit shellac they have been releasing albums pretty steadily since the mid 90s for example their debut LP at action Park a pretty significant record in the noise rock post hardcore math rock canon but a great deal of shellac reputation is built upon that of one of its members Steve Albini of course we cannot downplay the input from other members such as Todd Trainor and Bob Weston Bob you might also remember him from doing tape loops and sound effects for Mission of Burma but Steve is a super producer engineer studio owner he's worked with everyone from Slynt to the Pixies Nirvana Don cab the Jesus Lizard screaming females Cloud Nothings and despite my love of his other projects like big black sometimes Steve's reputation as a producer and an engineer overshadows his influence as an artist regardless that is what we are going to focus on here with this new LP dude incredible is an album of music that is as clearly and as boldly stated as the title that represents it this thing is nine tracks 33 minutes we have guitars drums various members of the band trading off on vocal duties there are loads of very crunchy sharp distorted guitars and bass guitar on this thing sometimes the guitars can get kind of shrill or so distorted that the sound is just like destructive it's on fire it's crumbling shellac continues on this new record to offer pummeling grooves and riffs that often times are in a really weird time signature on this new record shellac continues to offer pummeling riffs some of which ride some some off-kilter grooves a lot of these riffs or guitar leads are repeated to help bring tension up as the song progresses the vocals feature some yelling some screaming some kind of raw spoken word a little bit of amateurish singing and the production as usual is pretty clear it's pretty crisp the drums are really boomy the guitars and the bass are really close and up in your face I think the vocals are a little muffled unfortunately on this record when comparing them to previous shellac efforts especially at action Park and a thousand Hertz but still on this new LP like on previous releases the are usually pretty stark and no BS one of my favorite tracks from 1000 Hertz you'll hear a lyric like this is such a sad  song we'll be lucky if I don't break out crying all of these characteristics I just mentioned you can find running pretty continually through the entire shellac discography shellac sticks to its self applied minimalist tag as well there aren't that many overdubs or layers on this record the distortion isn't usually so heavy that it takes away from the dynamics of the guitars everything here is pretty free of reverb the the recording overall just very dry it's very clear that shellac pulls a lot from bands like Mission of Burma or have a great appreciation for the music of Fugazi or take a great deal of influence from bands like wire and I guess it's cool to see that these influences still have a place on the band's newest records it's also another instance of the incredibly raw and dynamic performances that usually find themselves on a shellac record - there is a lot of interplay on this record record record record Steve Bob and Todd are just together in a way that you don't really hear a lot of bands together in studio recordings these days whether it be in commercial radio music or even in the underground because it's easier to record stuff digitally and just kind of multitrack stuff now and this comes out right from the start of this LP with the opening track that features a guitar riff that feels like it's pulled right out of a stoner rock song but they groove it out in a totally different way once the bass and the drums come in this is a six minute long track there's numerous parts to it a few surprise changes I owe that hook that I can't totally make out the lyrics mostly because the vocals do feel kind of muffled in comparison of vocals on previous records like I mentioned earlier but still the hand and the hand are there the energy the electricity behind this part in the song is just crushing there are a few likeable angular left-field rock songs on this record like the very dreary track Gary or even the incredibly funny at the very end I'm riding bikes but most of the tracks here feel more like abstract experiments in rock art and that's totally fine that's why I enjoy wire albums like 154 or why I enjoy earlier shellac records this results in moments like all the surveyors we're in the middle of the track with these pummeling raw guitarists you're getting these calls of kah kah kah song surveyor is great too this album has quite an obsession with surveyors although I wish that obsession led to a good track on the mayor / the surveyor which is kind of a one minute instrumental where the guitarist is so horrendously half-baked it just kind of leads me to think did you write this did you write anything or did you just figure you were gonna wing it while I do like relaxed performances and their energy and their aesthetic I guess you can't really go into this LP expecting a catchy straightforward or even an entirely visceral rock album because there are some I guess anti songs on here tracks like you came in me or the people's microphone hard-hitting tracks but they're also kind of daunting and challenging to you know you're going to need patience for these songs I suppose although these tracks - a lot like mayor surveyor do feel a tad under in as well overall I would say this is a pretty good LP there are some underwhelming tracks there are some great tracks the entire album itself is kind of short and given that shellac really hasn't made any effort toward reinventing themselves on this LP it does have a lot of similarities with their past catalogue although in a lot of ways they are doing what they have always done as well as they have always done it I'm glad bands like this are still kicking if you're a die-hard experimental rock fan I would say give this record to listen and especially check out their back catalogue if you haven't already I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana shellac dude incredible forever "},{"id":"4EXtbijQOgY","title":"Rosal√≠a - Los √Ångeles ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone over 9000 here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rosalia album Los Angeles this is the debut album from contemporary Spanish folk singer Rosalia featuring longtime composer and multi-instrumentalist and producer Raul were free on pretty much every single track and this record was truly a hidden gem for me this year I went trolling through the internet looking for esoteric and obscure albums that I might have been interested or forgot about or wanted to return to this year just kind of checking to see hey should I review this do I need to review this is this something that I love and I'm gonna regret if I don't talk about it because it could end up on my year-end list I was also doing this in preparation for my 15 underappreciated albums of 2017 video which you should watch and I was filing through dozens and dozens and dozens of records and finally this one just stopped me in my friggin tracks I mean it was like a hard stop it was like a stop on a dime stop it was a stop I was just hit with this stunningly beautiful Spanish folk music with these fluttering nylon guitar strings being picked in such a wonderful way the dramatic strumming on this thing and the choice of chords I felt like I was listening to a moody progressive flamenco album the guitar on this thing is really the focal point of the background instrumentation very rarely are we getting any other piece of instrumentation but when we are maybe it's just like a little touch of strings some very calm cool gentle vocal harmonies on the song poem you put them to low passin we have this weird tape like a cassette tape fast-forwarding and rewinding sound effect going on in the background which creates a very odd texture and tension that I think adds quite a bit to the track so there's not a lot of instrumentation on this thing outside of guitar acoustic guitar and vocals but Raul and Rosalee are actually pretty dynamic performers in the first three tracks alone on this thing there is a large sea of difference in mood and style and tone you have be welcoming and the gentle and the gorgeous opening track on this thing which feels almost like a lullaby it's one of most beautiful songs on the entire record and eventually it morphs into this incredibly sad tune with these weepings string sections then you have the really dramatic and hard-hitting de plata which features these aggressive and very fastly strumming guitar chords this echo that is enveloping it's soaking the song it just resonates off of Rosalia's vocals which have this incredibly tight vibrato her vibrato is actually like acrobatic it is that tight it's that incredible it's that fast and with the speed and just the intensity with which she's singing it's like I'm listening to a call to prayer and the incredibly subtle no squid almost solely tous makes creative use of silence and volume to create tension and swells of emotion gorgeous gentle vocal harmonies at the finish of this thing and the guitar playing on this thing has this huge classical influence coming off of it so these shifts in style and emotion are here on this album it's just that they're not overt changes because the baseline instrumentation remains the same and it's not really something that needs to change because the performance is on this thing are so incredible they're so impeccable they're so versatile like for one there's the vocals which I haven't even gotten into yet Rosalia's voice is a stunner her range on this album her passion her youthful but very powerful tone her volume she just really rifts out these notes that just stay at this incredible peak of intensity for long periods of time with just like no variation in in in in in energy it's like her voice doesn't doesn't get weak it just has this incredible amount of power no matter what she's doing I don't mean to say she doesn't understand the power of restraint though she shows an incredible amount of restraint on numerous parts of this album which is when she hits you with those emotional with those high volume highs it just feels so great it feels so incredible it's so exciting the singing on this thing is so dynamic it is so raw which for me was really refreshing because it's rare that you get a female singer this talented who is is is recording an album that is this raw this intimate as you would typically expect the music industry to push someone like Rosalia into the overproduced world of pop music where her voice is obviously going to be doctored and doctored and doctored and then wrapped in a bunch of lifeless production one of the few alterations consistently made to Rosalia's voice on this record is just that she gets a splash of echo a splash of reverb which when that hits it's like her voice becomes this all-enveloping bullhorn sound that just fills my head she just has an incredible voice on this record one that if honed will only become more interesting with time as far as the song structures on this thing go it really is a range there are some tracks on this thing that are sort of long meditative cuts that are a little patience testing but they still come to a strong conclusion and then there are cuts on here that are more straightforward rootsy folk ballads with twanging guitar overdubs or really endearing vocal harmonies like tave and arrow or not yeehaw day at one Simon and then there are a handful of songs on this thing that are super short or maybe a little redundant and come to a somewhat inconclusive finish and then you have the lyrics on this record which obviously Spanish is not my first language so there was a language barrier to get acclimated to which I think for a lot of people is going to be kind of a hurdle with this record because the language of the album is a defining characteristic of one of the two major instruments on this album and my understanding of Spanish is super bassline and of course you're not just talking about Spanish words and sentences you're talking about literal poetry on this thing so of course you can't just literally transcribe every single word from Spanish into English and get the full translation because you're going to have metaphor you're going to have symbolism that you may be overlooking but generally the imagery that is conjured in the lyrics on this album is pretty mournful it's pretty dark a lot of direct connections between love and death or maybe even losing loved ones like on the song Catalina which is a bit of a musical revision of an older folk song from Manuel Vallejo and then there's another song on here which is literally about one brother going to wake up another brother at 2:00 a.m. to tell him that their mother died so again very mournful and a very morbid album to the music this thing is beautiful and it is inspiring but it is not a feel-good album that's for sure now strangely enough this entire album is topped off with a Bonnie Prince Billy cover of the song I see a darkness which is sung in English not one of my favorite tracks on the entire record because I think the guitar plane could have been a little bit more interesting I think the duo on this thing could have taken a little more liberties with the original song like they did with much of the source material that a lot of these songs are based off of because many of the tracks and the track listing here are not actually entirely original they are based off of older Spanish folk music song - which is really one of my favorite things about it that these artists are taking from something old lifting that to create something new which is in essence what folk song is all about folk music at its roots is kind of like a game of musical telephone passing down melodies and stories for generations which is a tradition that has kind of been lost in this age of popular music and contemporary copyright law so it's great to hear a new album that is quite literally keeping that tradition alive and doing it beautifully I'm thoroughly impressed by this album few tracks here and there I thought paled in comparison to others and obviously it would be interesting to hear Rosalia take advantage of more instrumentation maybe more guest musicians in the future but this is a very strong and well performed album and again total sonner for me I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

my oh are you looking for this I know you were looking for this you're not gonna do my boy Jaden like that you're not gonna do it to my boy Jaden Anthony he's a good rap man he's got good raps huh oh you got them hi everyone come on us seriously here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review and the new Jaden Smith album sire this is the breakout project from heir to the Smith family fortune Jaden Smith no but seriously though Jaden Smith is an actor a rapper and embarrassing tweet writer and son of megastar Will Smith and he's been hinting at jumping into the rap game for years now dropping every once in a while a new single a new EP a new mixtape stuff that was sort of listenable but not really worth taking SuperDuper seriously and I get it I understand why everybody wants to be a rapper right now but also simultaneously Jaden is following in the footsteps of his father becoming an entertainment industry jack-of-all-trades however I'm willing to bet that Jains musical career is probably going to be less significant than his father's was and don't get me wrong I can go back to songs like summertime and parents just don't understand even getting jiggy with it and they're pretty great pop rap tracks but you know even Will Smith will tell you that he was not writing music that was as essential as Public Enemy or nas he accepted that Lane as an entertainer and that's kind of been the key to his long-lasting success not trying to be something that he isn't Jaden however has somehow gotten the impression that he's deep which is an attitude that comes through pretty plainly in his music especially as he's so desperately trying to convince the audience that he's an icon before actually having achieved anything significant in his artistic field and he's not really shy about making references both Musical and lyrical to his canoe merarys like Kanye and Kendrick as if he should be mentioned in the same breath as those guys as much as he may openly say that that's not what he's trying to communicate he would certainly like the audience to come away from this record thinking that it's as great and as spectacular as like a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy I mean with the vocal snippet at the very end of the song breakfast Jaden essentially tasks himself with saving hip hop which is a mentality that leads to probably two of the worst attitudes that you can have going into a rap record that one the the genre needs saving and two that you're the one to do it this is pretty much a recipe for having your head up your ass I kind of feel like I'm getting ahead of myself with what makes this album so mediocre however I don't really want to do a play-by-play of what happens in every single track on this thing it's 17 tracks it's 70 minutes long I feel like that would be a waste of everyone's time I will say though I can't totally hate on this record Jayden makes a lot of very good production choices on this album he flows pretty decently on these songs songs like breakfast and the passion and George Jeff featured these instrumentals that our total bangers several of many on this thing and you could pretty much put any rapper with an above-average flow or charisma level on these tracks and you would get a very enjoyable song and musically speaking the for Part B lue that kicks the entire album off is actually one of the most epic intros of 2017 with the kanye inspired distorted vocals and rumbling bass on the song be the refrain I could put you oughta with on the song hell and of course you falling down falling down on you is like so oh it's such an orgasmic rush musically this album is pretty grand in presentation however it doesn't take long for Jaden's relative lack of experience and perception to set in I mean you will get a sneaking suspicion if you take in every single lyric on the song l which is the first hefty verse on the album Jaden is not shy about comparing himself to Martin Luther King twice which is one of many many many comparisons and name drops throughout this entire record what's even weirder is that as he's mentioning Kings name he says he's kamasutra Inge he says Kendrick is coming out of him and he'll Elvis is coming out of him too also this one line about needing to be up in the Senate I mean I guess Donald Trump is president so why the hell not but still it's like Jaden is trying to project this weird sense of struggle into his lyrics when the fact of the matter is he's been born into an incredible amount of privilege which is great I mean your parents worked really hard for you to have the opportunities that you have and there's nothing inherently wrong with that Jaden would be far from the first artist in popular music to start rich however let's not pretend that Jaden began anywhere but the top now ignoring genes poetic faults and lack of perspective on things this kind of becomes impossible as the album draws on especially as he's hitting listeners with bars like spitting radiation like Chernobyl there are entire verses on this thing you could essentially skim through and not find a single witty line a single quotable if you like you could have a little bit of a giggle on the song hope with some pretty pathetic attempts at trying to say something political on this very song Jaden does a little nod to the building seven conspiracy theories which have been debunked again and again and again and again so it's pretty apparent pretty early on that Jaden lyrically is not really that deep he's not saying anything that essential despite the fact that he certainly implies that but at least Jaden has good production on this thing at least Jaden has great instrumentals but there is a point at which even the album becomes less aesthetically pleasing because unfortunately Jaden's money cannot buy good taste there are multiple songs on this that have these weird totally unexpected boring unnecessary extended instrumental passages that take a song from one section to another section to another section or just kind of tack on this really just bland outro like the sudden beats which on the song breakfast that comes right after this ASAP rocky feature where it just sounds like some pitch down mumbling vocals that I mean I guess it's probably ASAP rocky but how is this a feature or the 9min song lost boy which is essentially the same hip-hop beat acoustic guitar young boy moaning combo for nine minutes this song did not need to be nine minutes or the song Batman which is essentially some very boring average run-of-the-mill woozy trap music that rips off the Jumpman flow as if that's interesting anymore while the song watch me is this really awful tacky rap/rock fusion that so obviously rips off black skinhead there are tracks on this thing that have a more hard-hitting a catchy er more exciting vibe songs like the passion and icon but even these cuts while they did leave a good first impression on me the more I listened to them the more tired I got of them and the more it felt like I'm literally just a shade or two away from just listening to rice gum flex on his haters on a stupid youtube diss track there are certainly some things that in general I can appreciate about this record that the instrumentals are mostly epic and enjoyable and well put together I can enjoy this album's extravagance its youthful exuberance its thirst its ambition it's obvious desire to be something more be something great however whether or not Jaden actually has the tools and the talent to achieve that it remains to be seen and the cons of this album far outweigh the pros Jamin essentially gives his ego a completely undeserved blow job for 70 minutes he's constantly implying as if he is educating and informing and enlightening listeners despite the fact that he has very little of substance to say about anything on this record except for whatever topics or political flavours of the month that his contemporaries have also addressed but much more deeply in their songs he recycles this silly your verses or your lyrics sound like dirty dishes line a couple times on the album as if it was good the first time on multiple occasions he brags about his record label as if anybody even is aware that his record label exists overall there's just a lack of vision a lack of scope there's not a single song on here that really needs to be longer than three or four minutes also the record periodically delivers these wee skits or transitional moments with that reference Jaden or sire being asleep or being in some kind of dream state like he's progressing through a narrative but the narrative doesn't actually build up to anything or go anywhere I have a feeling that he kind of got this idea from either a Kendrick record or like from because the Internet but he didn't really know where to take it so it just kind of eventually disappears at one point on the album and you get no more references to these skits or transitions anymore I'm really just kind of feeling like in general this record is is is fake deep it's it's kind of it's kind of fake deep there's just too much filler there's too much awful moments there's too much completely drab boring average run-of-the-mill trendy thoughtless and middlebrow songs on this thing for it to truly be entertaining and worthy of the runtime that Jaden has given it ah transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it the like if you like please

REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone Donald out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new health record death magic health is a California noise rock outfit that blew up the blogosphere in the late 2000s with some fantastic tracks off of their debut full-length LP it was an ear-piercing debut record that even impressed the likes of mr. Trent Reznor himself and the record had this really cool combination of just abrasive sounds but it also had like this sweet side to it that the band ended up embracing a little bit more on their next full-length LP get color where they actually came through with some of their catchiest pop influenced singles yet songs like die slow the single USA boys actually came out around this time too but still even though get color did have some catchy er songs on it these accessible tracks as well as the more abrasive tracks on the record we're all topped with these really Airy just cold disembodied vocals that have kind of since then become a like a trademark for four Health's sound and since that record health is indulged in some other projects as well as like sound tracking which is actually really cool but still I've been waiting for a record from these guys for a while because they inhabit or really interesting crossroads between pop music and electronic music and dance music and noise and noise rock and experimental rock it's an unlikely combination of influences and and yet death magic ends up sounding so bland on Death Magic health does manage to pull together some heavy and massive walls of digital mayhem especially on tracks like men today but songs like men today are often the really chaotic exception on this album these tracks are usually the shortest on the record and at the end of the day just really end up sounding like these little detours to kind of counterbalance what the bulk of this album is and that is these kind of really moody indie tronic dance toons that's the bulk of this album the kind of stuff that I think would have blown Minds more if this had come out around the time that like Crystal Castles debut had dropped which is kind of an understandable sound and influence for health to have I mean they have collaborated with Crystal Castles before in the past but still regardless I think essentially what that's kind of communicating to me is that it's been almost 10 years since the release of Crystal Castles first album and they almost have like nothing in terms of a new idea I've always thought health has had some really cool and intriguing noisy and abrasive ideas that work themselves into their records but on Death Magic these noisy ideas these sonic experiments usually sort of play second fiddle to these dance pop tunes and these songs are often kind of dreamy high gloss and and top with these really lifeless vocals and there isn't really that much in the way of sonic experimentation on a lot of tracks here like the really sugary song life which actually I think could have been a b-side off of like an m83 record or at least like a Passion Pit record that song again is it's sugary it's shamelessly sugary there's also the song dark enough as well as flesh world UK which just kind of sound like modern conventional dance tunes with the occasional shot of feedback worked into the beat just to make it sound a little edgy and if that doesn't convince you of this records edginess then you just got to listen into some of the lyrics I mean some of the lyrics on this record are apathetic and just unplugged from a care in the world maybe even a little nihilistic at points I mean you just get a load of some of these song titles I mean hurt yourself drugs exist there are some tracks on here that find I think a better and a healthier and a more interesting balance between these dance tunes and the more abrasive side of health tracks like New Coke and stone fist I think probably my two favorite songs on the entire record so these tracks are kind of the middle ground on this record and then there are the other songs that bring on these heaps of noise like men today that I mentioned or the song salvia and these tracks are just structured as if health didn't even care about these songs as if they just kind of accepted that they were going to be these uninteresting detours that didn't really do anything but just provide a buffer between each attempt at a dance hit on this album just unnecessarily padding the record out and it's not like health can't structure a song there are numerous songs with pop song structures on here they could have at least taken the time to do something interesting with these more abstract tracks as they were breaking away from that aibee aibee structure instead these weirder songs just kind of feel like bridges to nowhere even if you like the poppier dance your tracks on this record these more abstract numbers just don't really add much of anything except again an attempt at a counterbalance to these catchy er moments which I don't understand why you need that I mean if that's the direction you want to go in just go in that direction no need to come up with these just unmemorable detours to make us think that the record is way grittier than it actually is but even with these poppier tracks even with these dance your tracks I mean a lot of the beats may have a lot of punching to them I think health comes through with some good production but there's really not much here in terms of like a song or a tune that I'm really gravitating toward and the the sugary sugary songs in the track listing here especially on the second half are a huge turnoff for me on this record health essentially tries to saunter into the world of dance pop without you know like a solid song without memorable lyrics and sometimes I feel like the the cold fish vocals that health usually brings to the table that that fit in pretty nicely with their more abrasive cuts on their previous two LPs just feel a little out of place on top of tracks like life for example and these vocals get kind of old kind of fast especially when you consider how much longer this album is then Health's previous output I mean 40 minutes over here their debut record didn't even top unfortunately I'm kind of indifferent to this record wasn't really digging it and there were some tracks on here that are pretty much some of my least favorite health songs so far in their career I mean I could see what they're trying to do with this record and I think some people are gonna like the the more danceable direction they've gone in with this project I just don't really care for much of any of it I'm feeling a strong for two like five on this thing transition have you given this record of

review of the new jeff rosen stock album worried pop punk prince formerly the frontman of bomb the music industry mr. jeff rosen stock coming through with a new record following up his impressive 2015 album we cool which was not just a catchy fun album of rock songs and punk rock songs it was an emotional roller coaster of self-deprecation diving into the everyday struggles of maladjusted Millennials who are high on drugs and low on opportunities it may be a little self-centered at times but on this record Jeff effectively turned into himself to express some universal truths that I think a lot of young people can relate to despite him being even four years older than me and and I'm barely a millennial and once again I worry Jeff is kind of dealing with his perpetual immaturity right on the opening track here he laments about his his loved ones and his friends getting older and moving places and and getting married and starting a family he sings about it as if he's like with puppy-dog eyes walking down Main Street shopping and then he just looks through the storefront window and he's like I'll never afford that oh never ever I can't get it out us back to 20 and it's not a problem it was just an analogy but okay um where was I but this isn't all about Jeff's woes about a you know sort of being a non-functional adults this album he also sort of searches outside of himself and turns his sights on the social chaos America has found itself in the middle of in this election year the song to be a ghost kicks off with these acoustic guitars and Jeff's singing about the unrest he sees in this new generation kind of being squandered on social media but then eventually their anger is sort of awoken as they realize they're tired of being out in the cold and how they're going to burn those fuckers in their homes and I think toward the beginning of the track there's a blatant reference to a lot of the police brutality that's been displayed in the news over the past few years and the Rainbows is this really rowdy piece of ska punk that i think is about a being evicted and just living broke I mean it's not really that long or that densely lyrical of a song and the thing is that this track and many other cuts in the second half of this album are all like these little vignettes that segue into one another really seamlessly and in a way all these tracks come together and tell a complete story or at least give a full picture of Jeff's thoughts and opinions on the economy the rich and our political class in America taking advantage of the poor the song bang on the door is like another extension of this tract where Jeff is sort of paranoid of this eviction I think as he sings about the neighborhood he lives in judging him for sleeping Lee and coming home drunk late at night this story continues on to the track planet luxury where Jeff is singing about the cycle of poverty materialism luxury and desire that a lot of the poorest Americans find themselves locked in just take a look at these lyrics right here they're actually a quite soul-crushing and the song hellhole is a dramatic moment in what is essentially this punk rock opus with numerous phases to it the song has a gentle opening that eventually leads to this powerful climax both lyrical and musical as Jeff is shouting at the top of his lungs we don't wanna live inside aho now there are moments where Jeff veers off from these topics like on the track while you're alive which is a song where you sings about wanting to tell someone who cares about wanting to tell someone who matters that they matter that he loves them while they're still around because it's his opinion that if people feel least wanted and least important while they're still alive but hey everybody loves you when when you're dead and toward the end of the track Jeff kind of gives us the philosophy of the title here singing that love is worried love is being concerned love is caring about somebody you worry because you're concerned you worry because you care and the Xplosive clothes are perfect sound whatever is exactly about how perfection is such a futile pursuit because perfection hey it takes too long so say the lyrics or rather perfect take so long because it doesn't exist what I love about a lot of these short tracks as Jeff comes through with not only catchy music but one liners on every single song he's making a great point on every single track here he really thought of what he wanted to say and then thought of the best way to phrase it so that he could condense it down and just a couple lines and just make an immense impact on the listener in the first half the record a lot of the tracks are a little more standalone they're not like in this series of very quick seamless cuts like the song I did something weird last night where Jeff in a story seems to make out with this girl and then he's worried the next day about her regretting it or not wanting to have anything to do with him or thinking he's weird and the song waved goodnight to me which I was sort of on the fence with when I first heard it sounds way better in the context of this record really fun song that sort of same self-deprecating humor coming through in the lyrics again some very fun guitar leads on this track as well a cool guitar solo it's just a really fun Punk song you know it's it's it's fun but it's got this element of a I don't know self-destruction to it that kind of is just lined into the seems so subtly that you don't necessarily have to eat into it but once you do you're Lagoo this is like kind of dark but it's kind of fun now the sound of this album I like it it's not quite as cleanly produced or as decked out as we coul was which I did think was pristine to a fault at some points kind of Bumi and over compressed as well occasionally still though on worry there are occasionally some nice touches of keys and horns and acoustic guitars and big gang background vocals little vocal harmony here and there and some glockenspiel too kind of twinkling along with some of the lead melodies hanging in the background sounded kind of silly the punk rock guitars and drums on the same sound pretty good though they are a little muddy they aren't quite as punchy I think they bleed into one another a little bit which has its pros and has its cons I mean the recording on this thing feels very live and in the moment like all these seamless tracks that I'm talking about on the record it feels almost as if the band sort of played that all in one go which is pretty exciting it's like sounding like you're at a Jeff Rosenstock show or something the con is that things are a little messy here and there like on the song I did something weird where it feels like he can barely keep up with the words that he's written for himself because he's singing as such fast speed and in such a I don't know a weird flow still though I think that amateurish nosov Jeff's voice is part of his appeal though it is certainly an acquired taste his singing is somewhat off-key occasionally very yell P but you can't deny that he really sells these tracks he gives them a lot of passion gives them a lot of emotion and the vocal melodies he writes are pretty good even if he can't sing them perfectly the only track that sort of stuck out to me as being weak was maybe a blast damaged days which had these very dreary underwhelming 90s alternative rock passages that I don't think Jeff really did too much justice but overall I think Jeff did it again on this album he did it once again in some respects I think the Salim is even more ambitious than we cool even if it is sonically a little Messier because not only do I like that the lyrics are a little more diverse topically but I think the band creatively and all these short songs together really nicely and in the lyrics I think Jeff effectively painted a very vivid picture of the cracks in the American dream that all too many people slipped through it's a rock album that is simultaneously fun angry socially aware sharply written undeniably smart at some points I would say and I think Jeff continues to be a very vibrant and interesting musical personality on this record - I'm feeling a decent of strong eight on this album tritscher church or transition have you given this album a listen did you love it

everyone so Anthony sure-tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new arc album itself titled London via Caracas producer and singer-songwriter ARCA is back with the third full-length commercial album highly anticipated at least for me because I thought that this new record over here would bring a big change and sound and style Arcas music has always intrigued me but hasn't really been able to hold my attention keep my attention I've never been floored by an arc album even though there are some really special and amazing things about Marquez music for one the sound the way he treats sound on his two previous records is fantastic his approach to sound craft is incredibly creative it's so vivid it's so textured the auditory world he creates with his music is incredible it sounds like his ideas come from another dimension or something but when it comes to progression or structuring a track Arcas songs leave a lot to be desired a lot of tracks on Zen and a lot of tracks on mutant just kind of feel like disconnected avant-garde auditory vignettes I don't really do all that well when it comes to reinforcing one another sure on an arc album there's tons of awesome musical and auditory ideas but when it comes to again building a track there's just something kind of missing now that kind of seems to be changing on this new album over here a little bit and that change comes at the hand of the incorporation of vocals on this album yes now ARCA is singing over his own instrumentals on this record and it's done almost entirely in this really eerie nasal falsetto that haunts my nightmares along with the visuals in the music videos that have been released in promotion of this album but if the vocals do anything on this record it's that they give the experimental production on this album a stronger sense of direction in my opinion the singing on this album also brings out of a wry interesting influences that I hadn't thought of before with artists previous records for one bjork bjork is most definitely an influence on our cannot all that surprising to hear given that archit has produced four york's previous record or her latest record at least as of now Szolnok kira he's also done production for fka twigs and lo and behold there are some elements in my opinion of a kind of alternative contemporary R&B on this thing i also think there are some ideas on this album for those fans of moody trip-hop music maybe a Portishead fan or people who are into really whimsical strange experimental baroque pod maybe an Antony and the Johnsons fan just kind of imagine a lot of that baroque instrumentation a lot of that classical whimsical instrumentation being transformed into more synthetic sound instead and also there are moments on this album where I feel like I'm listening to some kind of strange digital avant-garde opera especially on cuts like anoche the dissonance and the harshness of our commute is still here but the vocals just add a totally different dynamic to that it's a beautiful element a human element to a degree I've always appreciated how alien Arcas music sounds but you know I'm kind of liking what this lonely strange very sad singing is bringing to a lot of these tracks now not saying the vocals on this thing sound great in the traditional sense I most definitely don't think that but I think for what this record is I think for the context that's brought with the instrumentals the vocals do work they do serve a purpose for example I can't really imagine myself enjoying the breathy monie singing on the track fugue essays in any other context other than that track with all these heavenly warped rushes of synthetic tones and the operatic singing on the tracks in window is chilling sending tingles down my spine as the vocals are singing over what sounds like I don't know that this attempt at making some kind of synthetic symphony or pit orchestra but a lot of simple tones kind of come together into this sort of smudgy chaotic way now unfortunately I still have my reservations with our chasm music and this album it is not a perfect record in Arcis first foray into writing more structured tracks does not go off without a hitch there's still a handful of tracks on here that I think go pretty stale pretty quickly either because of a lack of progression or uninteresting progressions there are a number of tracks on here that I think lack any semblance of a solid ending or any kind of finality the tracks sauntering I love this song or at least what it sounds like for the moments that it exists in because the interesting and beautiful scent progression that brings us to this really weird and odd vocal passage toward the very end of the track and then it just kind of cuts off almost immediately at about the two-minute mark there has to be this is one of the most compelling moments on the entire record how is there only two minutes of this especially when you're ending the song in a moment where it feels like wow it sounds like this is going somewhere else obviously it's going to end it's ending the song virgin is a somewhat odd instrumental but it just kind of sounds like a cut that could have been on the last arca album I sort of feel the same way about the strange keyboard piece child that finishes the entire album off the mix on this track is particularly weird all of these synth tones kind of layered on top of each other in such a way where there's just kind of this big rush this push of sound whenever they pop up it kind of sounds like ARCA is almost just like smashing his hands town on his keyboard but obviously this sounds like there's a lot of composition to this track so he's not literally doing that but just again the the sound the mix of it is kind of strange to me the song width is actually in a way another favorite of mine on this album but again amazing idea with literally sampling a wimp and it sounds so great like the sound of the whip is so vivid and crisp and clear and the way that the sound of this whip whipping is sort of chopped up and made to be really jittery really sporadic it's really overwhelming and strange and I actually again think is one of the best ideas that this album has to offer and yet it only lasts a minute you would think that it would be almost necess to extend this idea out into something just more fleshed out given that it sounds unlike anything else on the album the fact that it is so short only makes it feel like even more of a random nonsensical detour and you know while I do appreciate and enjoy the inclusion of the singing on this album not every vocal part on this record is perfect or amazing on the track reverie the vocal effects that be singing on this track is smothered in kind of distracts away from the humanity the rawness the intimacy of the vocals that I enjoyed so much on nearly every other track here meanwhile the track Cora is maybe a bit too raw at least in the sense of there's a moment where the singing just kind of devolves into well a lot of the background instrumentation is just coming off a really vague not really sure where it thinks it's going you know I will give a shout out to castration even though this is just another instrumental track it's one of the best instrumental tracks that I've heard on NER Cal b'm thus far the rhythms are so hard and in-your-face and crispy and punchy it's really one of the most aggressive songs that I've ever heard ARCA put together I mean it's in a way a banger it's a mean and sort of distorted and aggressive and kind of industrial flavor - and I don't know I mean I feel like I've addressed the bulk of what this album has to offer you know again while I enjoyed the inclusion of vocals on this album I came away from this ARCA record feeling like the same way I have with pretty much every arc album thus far I mean the tracks don't really seem like they connect all that well flow all that well from the beginning to the end of the album don't reinforce each other all that well a lot of tracks with abrupt endings fantastic ideas abandoned way too early other moments where ideas are extended to the point where they just grow stale and uninteresting due to a lack of significant progression I mean going into this I thought man this could Arcas best album but in a way it's um even more of a inconsistent record when compared with the two previous efforts uh oh man I don't know I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this one and I'm just going to leave it at that transition

it's time for a review of the new self-titled Adam green and binki Shapiro LP Adam and green and binki Shapiro are exactly who they say they are what one is a former member of the New York anti-folk outfit the Moldy Peaches and the other is currently a singer in the trio The Strokes related trio little joy whose self-titled LP was one of my favorite records of 2008 now one of the most charming aspects of this LP that I was excited for when I heard it was going to come out is pinky's voice her voice is so soft breezy emotive it's just like honey on the ears I think she would have such a larger audience if she were a part of just some kind of vocal pop record that came out in the 60s or something like that someone get this girl in a time machine please and Adam Green's voice does have its charms as well it's kind of deep its throaty he croons like an old soul but he's kind of got this modern cynical slacker attitude and he could be kind of lewd as well which does add to his personality which can be pretty funny sometimes however he's not really too much on the jokey side on this new album I feel if there is a downside to just his style in general it's that songs of his can tend to be kind of sloppy maybe feel a little rushed even though there is really a huge sense of comedy on this new album there certainly is charisma and indefinitely romance on this very duet loaded LP I actually think Adam kind of shows maybe a slight bit of maturity through working with an artist who emotionally is more on that sweet sentimental kind of romantic side of the emotional spectrum however I don't really find the end result on this LP to be all that mature or anything like that actually I would pretty much say that many of the songs on here pretty twee very cute very quaint and both of these artists have relied on that quality in the past to make songs work make them entertaining but man that that twee feel it's extremely strong here really to me to the point where the most obvious comparison to this album that I can make is like she and him and you know I'm not really a fan of the m-word zooey deschanel project to me it's really too clean it's too cutesy it's too wholesome which is why this LP does appeal to me more Adam and Becky though they do go down this cute road they do maintain a certain level of grit as they same holding one another's hands frolicking through a field of flowers in the sunset which is pretty much how the song just to make me feel good feels just as I suspected there is a good handful of the songs on this LP that do feel kind of short abrupt rushed it's kind of like taking part in a one-night stand where you're the person who didn't actually know this was going to be a one-night stand and then when the person is gone in the morning you're upset that it didn't blossom into a full-fledged relationship so while this album may not be loved the short amount of time that it sticks around is well worth it though it's just a bit of light entertainment with some basic but nostalgic instrumentation which sonically is a lot like that Adam green album minor love that dropped a few years back production-wise they're just a lot of similar qualities between that LP and this there are a few occasional flares of ambition on this album like the really awesome woodwinds on the very heavy closing track on here in three or the strings and the bells on the track if you want me which just gives the song this huge sense of drama Edmund Bink you really do a good job of pumping some of these songs up instrumentally there are some tunes here that are just nice fine refined pieces of baroque pop a little bit of Nancy Sinatra here and there but certainly eccentric and and strange enough to keep things from feeling like a ripoff or just redundant and certainly another thing that keeps this album from feeling that way is the chemistry that Adam and binky occasionally showcase together the song pity love is maybe my favorite song on here and it is really an awesome two and a song with it with Adam and Vicky singing in perfect harmony over these sweetly dark lyrics like I offer pity love's sometimes so strong that you fear me or the line mistake my pity love for the kind that needs you songs like this one go over really well however there are Tunes like the song pleasantries where Adam and and binky are kind of trading lines singing back and forth are coming off really really stiff in the process the vocal performances on this tractors don't feel as intimate as they do on others here I mean this song in comparison really is like listening to a very awkward school play sometimes Adam and binky are kind of better off just singing their own tunes like the song Casablanca where binky has a fantastic vocal part the haha background vocals are awesome the harpsichord is a very nice touch and there are lots of spots on here where greens singing leads singing solo goes over really well too however I think the lowest point on the LP is the very messy and and yeah yeah glockenspiel lead I never found which to me is just this junk pile of lo-fi instrumentation that just does not have the I guess sort of charm the other songs on here do overall I did like this album but not that much Adam and binky certainly do have some chemistry do have something to work toward in the future if they decide to collaborate again but there's just not that much length there's not that much detail and there's not that much intimacy to a good half of the songs on here which are still likable on some level but you know I just wish this album developed into more than just kind of a fleeting crush feeling a decent a strong six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Adam Green and binki Shapiro forever "},{"id":"Oi-8UNm9d7U","title":"Pusha T - King Push ‚Äì Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"haha King push is back everybody Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Pusha T album King push darkest before the dawn the prelude one half of clips president of good music rapper cool guy push T who had been having a bit of a struggle getting his solo footing ever since splitting off from his brother musically but he came shockingly close with the release of his last full-length album my name is my name a lot of deep cuts trendy deep cuts on that thing that I did not care for however still to this day I bang tracks like nostalgia and numbers on the boards so certainly there is still potential in a new Pusha T record even though there are a lot of people out there who have discounted him and sort of see him as being past his prime but that potential I'm looking for I'm not totally sure if all of it is going to show up on this latest project over here I did enjoy the lead singles teasing up to the release of this thing but this thing is merely a teaser to the full-length album that Pusha T is supposed to be dropping next year at some point so is push it going to reveal his whole hand on this new album over here give us his all and not really hold anything back for us to sort of be anticipating with his next album because I'm kind of getting the vibe of that off of this project which in a lot of ways is kind of like a glorified mixtape but still a lot of the material here is pretty sharp and relatively no BS push a T doesn't really give himself the time to fool around or do anything outside of his comfort zone so as a result this project is pretty no-frills the thing kicks off with a throwback to the days of clips with the same narrator that I believe I heard on hell hath no fury asking Pusha T if he wants to be a drug dealer or a rapper saying he has to pick one and this is kind of the duality of Pusha T the balance that he strikes on pretty much all of his projects is he going to be this drug dealer type is he going to be a bad is going to be a demon or is it going to be a rapper who saves the culture with his really sharp wordplay and occasionally a conscious song as well and I guess Pusha T continues on this project to show that he can like do both maybe not literally because I don't think Pusha T is literally snitching on himself saying that he's selling this much cocaine and so on and so forth but that certainly seems to be a theme he returns to again and again claiming that that is something that he had done in a previous life now lyrically Pusha T has the same distinct delivery that put him on the map in the first place this really spacious narrative flow where he's not really trying to throw a mess of words out there or anything because he's just working on and concentrating on making every single word and bar count with either a personal revelation or some deep references or some kind of double or triple entendre for one verse after another Pusha T essentially gives us a bunch of bold bars and proclamations like on the intro track here where he says leave your conscience at the door saying you know this essentially is not going to be any conscious hip-hop project or anything like that saying we've got the monsters in the floor I love the one line on here where he's talking about having hands in the white like chalkboards as well as they take samples of them I make examples of them and this is a pretty great verse to sort of set the tone for the rest of the project and the songs may be really straightforward with some pretty simple beats but the percussion is kind of off kilter and sort of progressive at points too in a lot of ways it kind of feels like we're getting a bit of a throwback to clips era Pusha T once he went solo I feel like Pusha T worked so hard to not sound like one half of clips but now it seems like he's more open to embracing his past and giving fans what they've wanted for a long time like on the song untouchable which has this really Basie eerie skeletal beat really prominent biggie sample on the hook the song lyrically is a lot of various cherry pick pieces of braggadocio from the past few years of Pusha T's life for the most part although there is one point where a line does stick out to me where he says let's take the scenic route I could show you some strange fruit or stranger fruit and it looks like Beirut given what just happened over there that was a pretty hard hitting line then with the track more famous than rich Pusha T essentially is exposing a lot of fake rich rappers and with the flow and the instrumental on this thing it kind of reminds me of my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy era Kanye and it's no secret that I enjoy the music that I enjoy the instrumentals off of that record a lot so it's kind of cool does he push it to landing on something that sounds like it could have landed on that album that's also kind of the case for money pussy alcohol where ASAP rocky and Kanye West are featured on that track singing in unison on the hook a little lazy with the money pussy alcohol but I don't know it's kind of cute it's kind of endearing I like the the second verse on this track from Pusha T rapping about a girl who essentially was rejected by the guys in her neighborhood who regretted it eventually when they saw her getting picked up by sports stars with tons of money and so on and so forth I thought that verse was particularly poetic but back to this more famous than rich track the paid-in-full line toward the beginning of the track was killer and the line about snakes walking on the concrete was amazing - and how the rap fans are essentially getting hoaxed with all these visions of models and cars and stacks and and all that that were essentially handed it's like lifestyles of the rich and famous Elsa I love that one line where he says a no retirement plans no Derek Jeter's we all know I did it Rodriguez basically saying that you know we all know that he sold drugs just like we know that Aaron Rodriguez used steroids I could keep going on about a lot of these verses and a lot of these instrumentals for a short project I feel like there's an awful lot to say about it although there are a few hooks on here that I think are a little basic a little undercooked a little underwhelming especially Kalani on her hook toward the end of the album which I thought was a little long-winded and just kind of clumsy though I think she's a capable singer I just don't think the writing on that course was all that good I also think the song crutches crosses and caskets didn't really have that great of a chorus either although still I cannot deny lines like banana clips for you Curious George's that was pretty sick although again I think the lack of really defined and an expansive chorus is on this thing is all due to just how straightforward this project is supposed to be I love the Timbaland production on the song got em covered which is easily one of the most hard-hitting beats on the entire LP and it's so nutty and it's so kooky it's really in Neptune's throwback the young Dolf reference if you follow religiously any of the rappers whose videos are regularly posted on WorldStarHipHop was pretty interesting and then a series of bars talking about how rap fans or people who want to get into the rap game or following and admiring the wrong artists and there was this wonderful line on this track where pushed II said that you don't know he's a candle until he blows it or he blow it the song FIFA seems like another Clips throwback and and I don't know I I can't be mad at it I enjoy uh the the handful of clips throwbacks that this this project brings this actually sounds like an older track but sands push at ease brother especially with a really playful guitar line on this thing Pusha T is snide he's nasty he's charismatic as usual I love the very eerie and urgent and grimy kind of smoky and nocturnal track keep dealing with Benny Siegel that's great as well and the finishing track on here which has a great chorus from Jill Scott sunshine although I don't really know was going on with the background vocals on that track they kind of have this wonky dissonant quality to them that I think kind of ruins the heavenly vibe of the track and sort of the really serene feel of the instrumental here though this track is not all serenity it's actually more of a conscious and sad and somber sobering downtrodden track from Pusha T as he talks race politics Freddie gray and a plethora of other things to finish this project off I feel like I my name is my name he hinted toward doing something more conscious on a few moments here and there but it didn't really hit as hard as the more devilish tracks in the track listing here but I can't say that's the case for this song this is a really great ending to the album and definitely one of the more stand out songs on the project Pusha T definitely can move into this more conscious direction if he so chooses and it will be interesting to see if he embraces that a little bit more when King push eventually comes out again I like this project a lot it's definitely got me more excited for what's coming down the road then wrath of Kane did previous to the release of my name is my name so I mean I have no reason really to doubt what Pusha T is going to do at King push at this point this thing is in my phone I'm probably going to be going back to it repeatedly because it really is that good it really is that catchy in a lot of ways overall I enjoy it more than my name is my name even if there isn't a song on here I think is as great and as hard-hitting his numbers on the boards but who knows maybe it'll grow on me a little bit more I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given the sound will listen 2015 album reviews are done they're over list week classics week coming up album views will resume once again in 2016 you're the best Anthony Fantana music wow "},{"id":"ikquXWiyaj8","title":"Bj√∂rk - Utopia ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone painting poetry anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Bjork album utopia this is the latest full-length album from Iceland's owned Bjork her ninth studio record following up her 2015 album volnek Kira a bit of backstory on this record back in August Bjork described what was this forthcoming album at the time as her tender album a description that at the time felt more confusing than enlightening but now that I have a firmer grasp of the lyrical themes of the album it seems like Bjork is writing the emotional antithesis to her last full-length album essentially a breakup album where Bjork went into great detail about the build-up to an aftermath of the breakup of this romantic relationship that Bjork had forged in the early 2000s this kind of causing her to reference back aesthetically in a way to her 2001 album Vespertine with lots of dense and lavish layers of strings which brings us to the yen to volnek euros yang utopia now while utopia does have its moments of emotional anguish it is nowhere near as dark and as depressing as its predecessor it's quite the opposite most of the time a lot of the instrumentation on this thing is light its Airy it's bursting with color especially given that a bulk of the Arrangements on this album are handled by a fluke chorus a chorus of flutes which of course are backed by all these field recordings of birds that sound like their chirping away in a mystical forest on the production and even the musical side of things we have Bjork working very closely with ARCA once again which is pretty interesting considering that I think this is the most consistently she's worked with a single producer since like Mark Bell or Nelly Hooper in like the earlier days of her career now the lyrical themes of this album are of course a bit of a reversal as well this being Bjork Stender record Bjork's words don't seem quite as methodically organized and chosen here rather it seems like she's kind of throwing caution to the wind and just firing out all of these feelings of love and hate and infatuation out there with almost no filter considering this lyrics like on that of blissing me which is a track where Bjork can be heard unapologetically crushing on a new love interest firing text messages and mp3's back-and-forth with someone who she has in mind on this track it just makes a lot more sense all of these thoughts on sex and romance and the dynamics of men and women they're all very off-the-cuff and that's for better or for worse I think Bjork's newfound artistic freedom and the overall lack of boundaries on this record does lead to more interesting moments than not like the crashing explosions of auditory color that kicks the entire record off B song a rise in my senses a track that I wish was pared down a little bit honestly it could have been more dazzling as a more brief introduction but still the very bright sound of the track does kick the tone of the album off very well and we also have the very beautiful and ominous the gate which in my opinion is the musical equivalent to interdimensional travel I just kind of feel like I'm slowly being pulled into what I I don't know as I'm listening to this song it's all just very otherworldly with Bjork's beckoning vocals and the very strange warped samples orbiting a lot of this music all these really eerie distant kind of sparse tones the bold swells of Floop here and there and the track utopia and nearly every cut following it makes me feel like I'm listening to a majestic space opera being performed in like an exotic bird sanctuary which is kind of the core aesthetic of the record it does take a while for it to really kind of kick in and get into full swing but once it does it's like oh now truth be told a lot of these Bjork tracks don't have the clearest and boldest of structures to them a lot of them are quite meditative which occasionally leads to moments that come off a bit breezy these kind of chirpy interludes that I think pad the album more than they add and I think there are some cuts on this thing that fade out in a somewhat inconclusive way namely the title track here however there are plenty of very bold and very vast songs to follow the song body memory is this wonderful amazing and like mind-bending nine-minute lyrical odyssey that takes sexuality and lovemaking into the metaphysical the track is as erotic as it is epic considering all the dramatic musical arrangements all of the primal beats sequencing and lots of samples of like a big cat growling Bjork takes things from physical memories to emotional memories on the next track features creatures where she essentially sees somebody who has character traits similar to that of her ex-lover and it takes her back to a time in her head emotionally where she's still in love with this person it's like she's been transported back to a time before this betrayal even occurred the song courtship features some of the most nimble flew arrangements on the entire record very beautiful the cut also features some of my favorite beats sequencing on the entire thing I love the tambour of the percussion on this track it has this kind of light sputtering sort of acoustic feel to it it's an amazing pairing between Bjork's vocals and the atmospheric and huge flue arrangements to these subtle yet very dense percussion and the lyrics on this track I found particularly interesting because they sort of explored the cold sting of rejection and the and the bliss of attraction and the flue arrangements on st. are freakin godly where the album really falters for me is on the production side of the cuts loss and Sumi where the very loud suffocating mix on the beats as well as the distortion on them as well kind of fails to respect the beauty and the space of Bjork's voice and the flute arrangements it's pretty tolerable on loss but on Sumi it turns borderline hideous especially when one gets down to the narrative component of the song which reads like a very gruesome lashing out against Bjork's xMAP Barney for suing her over joint custody of their daughter the song talking about sins of the fathers and bloodlines it's packed with all this really vague all-encompassing terminology which comes off like vaguely sexist despite what she describes as Barney cheating and leading a double life and basically betraying their family and the tract personally I went through my parents divorcing at a very young age and it can be really weird and kind of confusing to hear two people who you know made you out of mutual affection say the worst things in the world about each other over the course of your lifetime that incredible sense of loss and betrayal can really light an undying flame of anger that defies all objectivity and civility and sometimes that anger and vitriol coming from both sides can be gendered and personally I'm willing to assume that that's partially what is fueling this right here whether Bjork is willing to admit it or not as a fan it kind of sucks to see her succumb to that a little bit on this track however I feel like if this album is anything it's an admission that Bjork is just as human as the rest of us while I don't think some of the feelings and sentiments on this track are the best of looks I do think it adds to the unfiltered approach that Bjork is taking on this record whether that be unfiltered affection or unfiltered bitterness all things consider though I do give the track points for being incredibly intense the last thing I would probably ding this album on is its length utopia is far and away Bjork's longest record to date at 70 plus minutes and while I haven't really shied away from albums around this length in the past I feel like this is one of those instances where if the record had just been pared down a bit its impact would have been so much greater some cuts could have been reeled in some cuts could have been left out altogether some cuts could have just used a bit more structure while this record will certainly sit in a unique place in Bjork's discography and it is one of her most revealing albums ever it is also one of her most bloated and unkempt - but to start tearing things out of it could have sacrificed the raw emotional feel of the album so I guess you kind of take the rough with the smooth on that one I would say this album is yet another pretty bold addition to the Bjork discography not one of my favorites of hers but certainly one of her betters I'm feeling a light - decent 7 on this thing transition at beginning this album a listen as you love

music nerd and its time for a review of the newly revised version of Car Seat Headrest's 'Twin Fantasy' a 'Twin Fantasy' you mean like this? that's not a twin fantasy that's a twin nightmare [distorted] straight out of Bandcamp singer songwriter Will Toledo aka Car Seat Headrest one of indie music's fastest rising stars and the album that put him on the map essentially 'twin fantasy' aahhh a record that at the time was very messy but showed a whole lot of heart Will essentially landed a music label deal off the off the buzz, the online buzz, that albums like this on his Bandcamp page were generating and immediately after signing he began plugging away on new releases that had a slightly better recording quality. he eventually ended up dropping one of my favorite albums of 2016 one of my favorite rock records of the decade 'Teens of Denial' this thing is just loaded with witty profound takes on the struggles of early adulthood the emotional limbo many twenty somethings probably find themselves in during their college years so after dropping a record that pretty much went toatally against the downward trend of most rock music today and and served as a reminder of what can make the genre so exciting you have to kinda imagine that Matador Records would just let will do whatever the hell he wanted and *laughs* in a way it looks like they did with Will's new album over here essentially being a full re-recording and a reassembly of his his biggest and most popular Bandcamp release 'Twin Fantasy' now despite the fact that i really enjoy Will's music and i have a lot of respect for where he came from 'Twin Fantasy' is an album that i've never quite been able to appreciate sure while it is a Bandcamp classic the recording for me is always been way too chaotic way too messy to really like all the way through even if there are some really loud, noisy and experimental mixing ideas on on the record that i think for the most part Will was just trying to make up for uh i i guess a lack of resources and equipment with just some uh very risky uh risks so he comes back with this new version of 'Twin Fantasy' this reimagined re-recorded version of 'Twin Fantasy' and for me personally it's pretty much improvemetns on all fronts i feel like i'm now able to enjoy this album as the diamond in the ruff that it is. if you enjoyed the instrumentals on 'Teens of Denial' you are going to enjoy the instrumentals on this album they are a few degrees noisier by compairson but i think that was mostly Will trying to do his best to sure, improve the the work of art that he's made here but also stay true to the original piece he pays homage to lo-fi aesthetics while pretty much putting together a series of tracks that are very well assembled and the end result in a way is kind of anachronistic it's it's weird to listen to and perceive this album coming after all the work that he has done up until this point because its kinda like going forward but also backward at the same time in comparison with his latest material in my opinion 'Twin Fantasy' isn't nearly as instrumentally ambitious i find the songs on 'Teens of Denial' assembled a bit more smoothly and personally i find his lyrics to be more eccentric, hilarious with these very vivid descriptions of emotions and scenarios that he's moving through i just feel like with his latest material we get a more detailed but vivid image and character portrait of the person who's personality and experiences are fueling these songs now in my opinion Will's song writing has changed and improved by leaps and bounds since he released 'Twin Fantasy' even with some of the alterations on this album having to do with some of the flow of the tracks or how the instrumentation paces out or Will's also making some lyrical alterations to a lot of tracks here but still even with all those changes what continues to remain true about 'Twin Fantasy' is that it is a super emotionally knotty and difficult album drowning in a sad chaos of sexual confusion, love, drugs and um *smacks lips* um *smacks lips* youth the opening track to this thing is roaring exciting song that really kinda sets the tone for the entire record following cuts that are a bit more measured and based around a more simple verse chorus verse format tracks like \"Sober to Death\" incredible catchy, super compelling interesting tune as well about essentially uh misery loving company sharing in your emotional problems with another person all of these very *laughs* difficult feelings are condensed into a very rowdy lo-fi rock tune the song \"Cute Thing\" has turned  into one of the most adorable tracks on the entire record talking about needing Frank Ocean's voice and James Brown's stage presence to essentially uh become a rock god which is one of the many funny lyrical switches on the album because prior on the original version of the record uh Will was talking about Dan Bejar's and John Entwistle's and you know what for me \"Cute Thing\" is one of the few tracks on the entire album that originally translated pretty well in fact i will say i kind amiss the nervous energy of Will's voice that was on the first version of the record but the pulsating dinga dinga dinga ding synthesizers and the very well executed vocal harmonies that kinda bleed into each other really chaoticlly are a very nice swap the song \"Bodys\" features all of these echo splash sequence beats there are actually a lot of incredible grooves and on this album that didn't quite pour through on the original 'Twin Fantasy' like in comparison with 'Teens of Denial' and nearly everything Will has done so far this is a pretty danceable record a very physical and visceral album despite just *laughs* how sad a lot of the emotions going into it are but again on \"Bodys\" this track features all of these echo splashed sequence beats a lot of references in the lyrics to dancing it's kind of about giving into this carefree, freewheeling youthful energy. the song has a fantastic groove great momentum, there's a crescendo after the half way point that is super exciting: it's a bloody mess of synths and drums and bass and guitars it's the kind of chaos where all the instrumentation is adding into a very collective and purposeful way then with \"Nervous Young Inhumans\" we get yet another killer driving drum beat, very sharp synth lead we do have a bit of an outro monologue that in my opinion goes a little long uh this isn't something that i was super crazy about on the last record but i actually prefer the previous monologue before Will totally just flipped it on it's head and added something completly different maybe this new one adds a bit more to the narrative however i i enjoyed how meta the last outro was because the song itself is pretty meta making references to art and writing and the creative process and i'm loving this new version of \"High to Death\" which in comparison with the old one is so much trippier and very psychedelic and weird especially with like all the reversed guitar la la la i definitely do get the sense that *laughs* the wall paper in the room is spinning it's very surreal and i love the return of the stop smoking melody in in a very dreamy fashion on the track too of course you get these multi facited monsters on the album as well these tracks that are ten plus minutes long and have numerous phases to them it's super epic uh \"Beach Life-In-Death\" and then \"Famous Prophets\" a new and improved version of the track features six more minutes of music bringing the length of the track out to sixteen minutes which now has a bigger crescendo a nice little piano part and an overall i just enjoyed what Will did with this revision a lot i mean pretty much any of the issues i had with this album had been mostly to do with the original source material and Will in my opinion growing as a song writer growing as a musician since the release of this album i still do prefer [Teens of] Denial which in my opinion has grown on me even more since the release originally but i love this new version of this record because it just allows me to enjoy this record for what it really is and that's just a great album i'm feeling a decent strong 8 on this thing transition: have you given this album a listen? did you love it, did you hate it, what would you rate it? you're

Flaming Lips - The Terror ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new Flaming Lips LP the terror this is the latest full-length album from Oklahoma band The Flaming Lips really one of the most important groups if not the most important group in modern psychedelic music really one of the biggest advocates of taking psychedelic rock and pop and just furthering it progressing it with modern technology and ideas and a lot of rock bands even experimental rock bands as they get older they tend to kind of mellow out a little bit however that has not really been the case for The Flaming Lips at all it seems like since the late 2000s stylistically they've been getting stranger and stranger with their music and their antics like the very textured noisy challenging and difficult album embryonic that they dropped in 2009 as well as the collaboration streamed compilation that they put out last year Hedy Fwends gummy skulls 24-hour songs Pink Floyd cover album hmm disturbing music videos verizon advertisements the band has been incredibly entertaining to follow in terms of their antics but all of this has you know sort of been in the way of putting out a new freakin album however I don't think one could say after listening to the terror that the band was at all distracted or was there are cheapened by all of these sort of extracurricular activities because for sure the terror is one of the Flaming Lips most focused and odd musical experiences thus far that they have released in their career in terms of concept and sound now the album embryonic that the band put out in 2009 in comparison to some of the more psych pop-oriented albums that they put out just before it is really a chaotic and freewheeling record and the terror in comparison with all of that is is most definitely not wild it's not rocking hell it is not even poppy instead the band goes on a sonic journey on this LP that is very cold it desolate its robotic all over this LP there are just throbbing pulsating rhythms on electronics wandering guitars that are very repetitive in nature vocals that tend to sort of hang in the falsetto range and range from being heavenly or even eerie you really could have named this album the terror : The Flaming Lips in space slash 2001 a Space Odyssey because there are a lot of parts of this album that remind me of the frightening and surreal imagery that that haunts the latter portion of that film as I move through the album and I'm listening to this album I can see that time is passing by and that the songs are going from beginning to end but there's a serious sense of stillness that is just all over this album in general the opener on this LP feels like it's pretty much in the same chord from front to back and a lot of songs on this album feel the same way the band will jam on one single chord for the length of an entire track but they will progress the track and introduce new ideas by experimenting with sound instead on this particular track throbbing electronics synthesizers that are both sort of light in area and ethereal and heavy low and monolithic brittle guitar screaming and panned all the way to the side of one channel and while this track seam is very repetitive for the five minutes that it lasts on the surface it sort of glides into the next song nicely not only does it have a cool segue like many of the songs on this album do moving from one to another but the song seems to sort of fade into the next logically as well like this album in a lot of ways feels like one giant song the next tracks on this LP be free away and try to explain are easily my favorite songs on this entire LP I actually think they're the best moments that the Flaming Lips achieve with this aesthetic that they're going for on this album the songs are very still they're very repetitive they just feel suspended in space and the vocals that just fly over the the weird soundscape that the band creates they are heavenly they are just haunting they're beautiful and simple as well it's like the opening track on this album was creating a ruckus and sort of propelling things forward whereas when we get to these next two tracks you're literally kind floating in space now you've gone from the ground into the atmosphere and you're past these songs the album continues to be even more psychedelic twisted surreal with the song you lust with just 13 minutes long and length this song is massive and it actually feels pretty krautrock inspired to tell you the truth if this song came out at around the time that noise was dropping their early stuff it would have been revolutionary but the thing is it's 2013 and as of today this song didn't really come off that way to me because while the song did open up with some really interesting sounds that were seductive very weird I felt like I was tripping into this whole different world by the time we get to the middle of the song things aren't really moving at a pace that keeps me engaged or interested the song gets pretty thin when it comes to new or interesting ideas the very simple guitar leads and the stale sense on this part of the track just get very old very fast and to me this progression is actually mirrored in how I enjoy the entire album in itself even though this album is under an hour and only nine tracks it feels like it draws on much longer because it doesn't offer a lot when you get to the middle point of the album in terms of melody or playing and even sound craft - I appreciate that the terror is very sound oriented and the band wanted to create a more sound and texture based composition as opposed to just a traditionally musical one but it seems like around the middle point of the album they're sort of recycling ideas that they used at the first portion of the album and not in a way that feels interesting or fresh either I just get a lot of these falsetto moans that aren't even necessarily on pitch a lot of the time over a slew of different synth sounds and noises or percussions the song you are alone to me just feels way too obscured to be enjoyable and the falsetto on this track is is really one of the most sour out of the entire album I'm just really too distracted by how off it is to really feel much of anything about I like the song butterfly a lot but the reason that I like that track is that it kind of houses a lot of the same musical or sonic ideas that the first three songs on the album do actually to me this song feels like a fusion of the first three songs in a lot of ways and I like that the song turning violent has a pretty apocalyptic ending to it with some chilling group vocals but the song serves up just another sour falsetto that I don't have much interest in and the closing track on this LP is easily the most rockin and cathartic on the entire album and not that really needed a song like this to sort of make it a good LP but actually despite the fact that it is loud and that it does have a strong beat to it it feels like just extremely anticlimactic for sure the terror has style it has an aesthetic and it has some vocal melodies that are worth buying into the sound palate on this album is awesome but I just don't feel like The Flaming Lips come up with enough sounds to justify an album of this length and the thing is the album isn't even that long the band is undoubtedly created something nightmarish but I will not be waking up from this in a cold sweat anytime soon I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hey des why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana The Flaming Lips the terror forever [Music] you [Music] "},{"id":"bRDENHaT2lI","title":"Grimes - Art Angels ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"ah hi everyone shave theny soon tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Grimes album art angels wholegrains be nice Anthony be nice to Grimes don't be mean don't be mean to old Grimes II make sure you're nice to the Grimes shop Branagh rhymes is a Montreal pop singer and producer who had a meteoric rise to fame a few years ago off the back of her full-length album visions it was almost as if she had come out of nowhere really she went from relative underground experimental pop obscurity to millions of hits on some of the biggest singles from this album like the song oblivion as well as widespread critical acclaim for this album however I personally not enjoy this album the washed-out production and the really high-pitched nasal vocals and the incredibly rudimentary vocal melodies and and keyboards just weren't really doing all that much for me the record really felt kind of one-dimensional and at this point that feels like it came out so long ago which is odd but I think it mostly has to do with the fact that these past three years have been so silent for grime she has been putting out any EPS or anything like that we did have the go single which it seemed like there was a lot of negative reactions to unfortunately and from what I've read in between now and and visions that was actually even in albums worth of material that had been thrown away we also did have a demo version of the song reality which I liked a lot I think that's a great single we have a sort of studio version appearing on this album outside of that Grimes has really kept things about this album under wraps now I wouldn't say I went into this album excited mostly because I didn't really dig the singles leading up to the release of this LP all that much we have the song flesh without blood which for me was just kind of this really trashy radio-friendly pop rock tune sounded really Charli XCX inspired and the song scream was a total train wreck between its whistles and redundant beat and rapid-fire Taiwanese rapping at least what I assume is Taiwanese rapping from a underground rapper by the name of Aristophanes so yeah admittedly I did not go into this record with the highest of hopes however the intro really caught me off guard the kind of orchestral electronics on this track I thought were stunningly beautiful in what I imagined or assumed or some organic instrumentation in there as well the strings whether they're being bowed or plucked just sound really gorgeous and Grymes very high pitched singing fits in really well with the instrumentation the track doesn't really give us a taste of what's to come on the record but it at least shows that Grymes abilities sit outside of just the lo-fi bedroom pop that we're used to now despite this promising intro I will say I think the first third of this record is a mess the song California which I like it's very peppy beat and how sunny the song is and its really persistent handclaps but this track easily has the worst lyrics on the entire record and the song belly of the beat it's not bad but it's kind of bland sort of seems like a slightly cleaner version of what Grimes had already been known for doing on her last length LP doesn't really feel like a progression of any kind like many of the other songs on here do however once past this point the album gets instantaneously great abs deserve Lou is a total banger I like the driving rhythm guitars on this track Grimes vocals on these verses are super sassy a lot of personality there are moments on the song where she's like screaming like an animal which is actually kind of refreshing and the the pre-chorus to the song sort of takes this a cheerleader chant that's really catchy and then all of a sudden once that hook busting the yelping vocals that she does are actually fantastic it's a really energetic fun eclectic pop song with just a booming beat and a lot of personality and I think the good writing and the personality continues on to the next track here the title track where Grimes pulls heavily from ray of light era Madonna the instrumental is completely blissful with a persistent kick drum is a really strong dance beat and on top of it a really snappy guitar loop manage manage but she sort of puts her own spin on the sound with all these weird eclectic electronic edits and really breathy vocal harmonies I love the tune alive the song easily is an OK tune this little piano track seems a little Enya inspired I think not one of the better songs on the record but sonically it is very chill it is very serene and I guess it's a nice instrumental change of pace from what's on the rest of the album but following this tracks like pin we have more pop bangers here I mean to me this track is like bubblegum dipped in LSD it's psychedelic and insanely catchy and the song reality I actually kind of like this newer version I think the the older version was a little roar it was it was cooler but this newer instrumental that backs the song isn't really that bad sort of reminds me of Crystal Castles debut record in a good way and Grimes still of course you know has a strong song at the core of this cut just like I already knew was there because the the song reality originally in the demo version was great and again this is one of the many tracks here where the influence of 90s dance pop just continues to ripple on this album very tastefully and the song venus fly with janelle monae another highlight on this record for me a really great fun bombastic and eclectic dance tune I wish Monet's and as well Grimes vocals were a little louder on this track sometimes I can't exactly tell who is who or what even exactly is being said though I will say on this album in general the vocals are way more audible than they were on visions and despite the vocals being a little a wash and reverb sometimes I still think these songs hold a lot of character Grimes is turning the world of pop music on its head with a lot of these songs I think this track specifically where it sounds kind of like a fusion of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation and some Spice Girl anthems plus a few mi a style refrains and some Diplo sized bass and the songs world princess in the closing track two are a little more easygoing bubbly lighter and just have sunnier melodies and album definitely needed it at this point because while a lot of these dance tracks are great I think they're a little syrupy a little darker and I think these two tracks are are kind of friendlier more tangible while I can't say I loved this record I liked it a lot and I think it was a really great improvement for Grimes I mean I think she's written better songs here I think she's got better production here I think she's taken more risks she's really diversifying her sound some of the experiments and some of the tracks here I don't think go over well specifically in the first third here where this album's Poppaea stuff and it's weirdest stuff show up however the rest of the material that sort of lands between that spectrum in the second half of the album or in at least the last two thirds of the album specifically I think consistently is great all I can say is that I hope the rest of her fan base takes to the record as well because I think there's definitely a brighter future in the sort of accessible but very left-field pop music that she's producing on this record I'm feeling a deist of strong sevit on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next what would you like for me to review after this review and I hope you have a nice day Anthony Fantana Grimes our angels forever "},{"id":"k-37V-1igRw","title":"Boards of Canada - Tomorrow's Harvest ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"Boards of Canada it is hot is hot right now hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Boards of Canada album tomorrow's harvest Boards of Canada electronic music duo whose musical style tends to run a little nostalgic you've got a lot of analog since in their recordings against some subtly IDM influenced beats and even though the analog cents do carry a certain era of music with them it's really the quality the sound quality of the recording that Boards of Canada works with that really lends their tracks some real magic retro magic recording that Boards of Canada typically works with is so grainy it's so smudgy in quality it sounds like I'm listening to a reel-to-reel tape or watching a VHS tape or watching a 9 millimeter film reel and even though on the surface this does sound a little bit like a gimmick the sound play and the music that Boards of Canada brings to the table on their most critically acclaimed LPS is really worthwhile it's not only incredibly melodic and memorable but very vivid with its imagery listening to an album like write to children is like listening to the soundtrack to an old documentary film or a sci-fi movie and when I say documentaries I mean documentaries about deserts Tundras space or under the sea just the most desolate places on the earth it's like the duo is really making up music for some kind of film that is going on in their heads especially with many of the shorter songs on these releases of theirs that last maybe 1 to 2 minutes it really feels like they're pulling together some incidental music for something and even though tracks like the smallest weird number do come and go pretty quickly they are strikingly beautiful in the synthesizer phrases and how the duo manipulates them while I'm sure the duo does have a certain picture or something in mind when their career getting a track the the way that they form their songs it really encourages the listener to sort of come up with their own narrative as well which has really made their music very engaging this is roughly the style that Boards of Canada have come through with on the more successful side of their career on work record since the late 90s of course with some variations in concept and sound from album to album but on this new LP of theirs tomorrow's harvest their first full-length in eight years I can't really say that Boards of Canada have spent that time reinventing themselves or coming through with an entirely different sound or mood I can't even really say they continued experimenting with some of the more natural and acoustic sounds that they introduced in a big way on the LP campfire head phase their last full-length there are some samples used on this album whether they be vocal snippets or something a little more musical however they're not really any more prevalent here than they are on any other LP I feel and like usual the beats skitter about they're sort of repetitive they are cold they're robotic but there is somewhat of a natural vibe to them because of the very splotchy sound of the recording in a lot of ways on tomorrow's harvest I actually think the duo is trying to relive what a lot of people consider to be their best full-length album really their mission statement music has the right to children and while yes this album is ambient it's not like that's an angle that the duo hasn't worked with before and in addition to the more apocalyptic vibe of this record certainly the lead single from this LP sells that angle but I think that desolation that comes through on many tracks here that is a feel that many of the duo's older tracks have have toyed with in one way or another it's not like these themes haven't come up before with Boards of Canada but I will say maybe they are at their most potent on this new LP maybe this is Boards of Canada's most sad and remote record now there have been a lot of triumphant comeback Sauveur the past few years that we have observed My Bloody Valentine Godspeed You black emperor Daft Punk of course this year Fiona Apple Justin Timberlake - yeah I wasn't crazy about the record but a lot of people were so indeed there is more than one way to have a successful return to music and I think Boards of Canada is in in regards to buzz and and possibly record sales in some ways I actually think Boards of Canada's aesthetic is is more relevant than ever in this current cultural landscape that we sit in that is obsessed over things like Polaroids and as David's and as their technology and in musical expressions from 30 40 years ago we are post chillwave people and I understand the appeal of this angle I too love a nice revised piece of musical nostalgia but Boards of Canada's sound is is incredibly well established at this point they're not some trendy newcomer or even an old face trying out something completely new so even though nostalgia may be a key feature in boards of Canada's music is is this new record as good as their previous efforts is it just a good listen in general I personally feel that tomorrow's harvest is is a slightly uninteresting come back for Boards of Canada because essentially on this record in my opinion they have come back to do exactly what they have done before but with less detail less adventure less extravagance less memorable moments now for one I've never really been huge on LPS that bring together a smattering of short motif like tracks this is part of the reason I don't really review soundtracks on this channel because I truly feel that in order to enjoy the soundtrack to its fullest extent that the images need to be there as well the soundtrack was made to marry with the movie now I know that Boards of Canada's previous albums are all like that however on many of their old tracks especially the short ones the sound play and the melody writing was so vivid and was so out there it was striking it felt inspired it brought this sense of wonderment tracks like the color of the fire or triangles and rhombuses these were tracks that had a strong retro vibe to them yes but we're also experimental very psychedelic kind of trippy to the point where it felt like these sounds even though yeah we're familiar with them being from a different era of music hearing on this record it's like they're coming from a completely different world entirely I can't really say that's the case for tomorrow's harvest like the very short track on this record telepath we're really the only interesting thing about the song are the manipulations of the vocal sample and the very murky buzz and the bumbling melody on the track you ritual this song the sounds that it delivers feel so effortless for Boards of Canada in comparison with some of the busier tracks in their back catalogue it's it's really borderline offensive and the song collapse where I'm really hearing a bunch of synth arpeggios brought together with the sounds of wind it really feels like Boards of Canada are truly recreating the soundtrack music sounds the progressive synthesizer soundtrack music sounds that inspire them as opposed to building on them experimenting with them even the longer tracks on this LP don't have the amount of meat on them that Boards of Canada used to lay into them like the track Whiteside Klose with some droning sense some pulsating chords and a very eerie melody it sets an apocalyptic mood but it is not engaging for the full three minutes that it lasts there are songs on this LP that I like but I still end up sort of having my reservations about them like the song reach for the dead the lead single off of this LP which I do enjoy the song has a really strong mood to it it feels like doomsday with how lurches and just pulsates forward very coldly but I feel like how strong that mood is on this track has more to do with decades and decades of synth music and that kind of being an institution that we are familiar with as opposed to anything that Boards of Canada specifically does with this particular song I do like the way that the beat creeps in toward the end of the track but I have to say in terms of progressive synth music progressive electronic music out there what Boards of Canada are doing on this record just feels a little sort of elementary still the song jacquard cosway's is is pretty refreshing with it's very off-kilter beat and these swirling synthesizer phrases that that are really dizzying sort of hypnotic and they move I would I would say very warmly as the song progresses forward it's really sort of inviting in a way one more inviting tracks on this entire LP the track sick times has a very ominous feel to it but it brings that downtempo sound that Boards of Canada toys with once in a while and the song Palace Posey is is maybe when I favorite tracks on here has some great vocal samples very musical and I'm loving the the more natural feel of the drums on this track they almost sound like live drums and again with the vocal samples I love how strange and scattered and distorted and manipulated they are and when these local samples come in they introduce a really awesome chord change and the chord progression on the song nothing is real is really uplifting again another warm track in this collection as I said there are highlights on this album but they are as prevalent as gas stations greasy spoons and convenience stores on on an abandoned stretch of desert road because a lot of the cell P does feel like driving by tumbleweeds rocks sand and coyote corpses I really do think a lot of this album is pretty uneventful and the only way that the songs truly work together is to create a slightly forgettable experience which I understand is a bit of the point to create this vast sense of nothingness but I think there are different ways to go about that other than to just incorporate less elements less experimentation less melody still overall I have to praise this record for the songs on here that I did like and even the tracks that I didn't care for too much they were still immaculately produced the sounds were great and at least Boards of Canada were able to bring a consistent mood a consistent emotion to this record I'm feeling a light two decent six on this record if you given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to clipping who recently got signed to Sub Pop Records yeah Gavin Pia and Gerry Jen jr. st. Junior the third only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Boards of Canada tomorrow's harvest forever [Music] [Music] "},{"id":"Y7cCytQCaAM","title":"Metallica - Hardwired...To Self-Destruct ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Metallica record hardwired to self-destruct thrash metal legends Metallica are back with a new record James Hetfield and the gang have delivered 77 minutes of new material on this thing on the standard edition it is a double disc album that actually had some pretty reputable teaser tracks songs like hardwired and Atlas rise I mean tracks that you know they're not exactly ride the lightning but they are some of the best material Metallica has released in years and show that the band is starting to get back in touch with what made them so good in the first place something the band lost sight of during their regrettable reinvention during the load and reload era and then the deterioration of Metallica's appeal continued on Saint anger and Death Magnetic - the worst produced Metallica albums to date the hard wired is is definitely an improvement and one that has been seeing some pretty positive reviews across the board at least positive for Metallica it is pretty trendy to hate on Metallica but I think this album was bound to receive some positive reviews no matter what based simply on the fact that this is not Lulu which unfortunately will most likely go down as one of the most hated albums in rock history not really because of the quality of its content I think the album isn't usually critiqued on that in my opinion I like some elements of Lulu but it was a project that was bound to fail because one the last thing Metallica fans want to hear is some burnt-out rock poet rattling off these sexual and esoteric diatribes and the last thing Lou Reed fans want to hear is the kind of metal that sounds like it should be booming out of the back of a pickup truck just two worlds that never should have collided but somehow the stars aligned and the rest is history so in a way all Metallica had to do here was just not come out with another Lulu but I think they surpassed at least that expectation so in a way all Metallica had to do here was just not come out with another Lulu but I think they surpassed that expectation with a set of songs that throw it back to the good old days and unfortunately I don't mean the 80s good old days of more like the early 90s like Black Album era Metallica very solid but also very commercial the band is once again dishing out these kind of mid paced groovy heavy thrash riffs that are very catchy very anthemic they're also bringing the kind of lyricism that showcase a bit of cynicism when it comes to the human condition Metallica of course is talking about war on this record man's tendency toward violence power and death the song confusion even touches down on PTSD and the mental scars that some soldiers suffer after coming home from war I also like that songs epic harmonious guitar layering quite a bit but that's on the second disc as far as the first disc the start of this album is concerned it is very strong again those teaser cuts I mentioned earlier luma mwah and the song moth into the flame isn't really that bad of a high-octane moment considering that this is the third act of Metallica's career though the song dream no more sort of sounds like a regrettable return to the load ERA with its kind of funky groovy guitar riffs which are topped with some really odd vocal harmonies that sound like they were pulled straight out of the Alice in Chains playbook and the song halo on fire while it's not bad I really liked the tune I really liked the ballad at the core of the song especially how it kicks off it sort of reminds me of one of the darker moments off of the Black Album something I was hoping to hear a return of but quickly the song just kind of transitions into the same kind of mid pace thrash riffs that you can hear throughout much of this record and that's the thing while this album does in a lot of ways feel like a throwback to the Black Album those sort of dark moody ballads where the tunes were just excellent and made for some Metallica's best most memorable tracks just or not here unfortunately which would have been nice because that would have provided a little bit of variety in the track listing here a variety that unfortunately the second disc of this thing does not really bring for sure confusion is great and the very explosive closer spin out the bone is one of the fastest and most intense moments on the record but man unkind here comes revenge and murder one sort of failed to really make their case as essential tracks in the track listing here especially with lyrics like here comes revenge just for you revenge you can't undo revenge it's killing me revenge set me throw and aces wild aces high all the Aces aces till you die and then a my savage brings that same kind of funky groovy thrash guitar riffing that made mid to late 90s Metallica so intolerable you know it's a decent Metallica album again some of the band's best material in years but it is a very bloated record in my opinion a lot of tracks that didn't really need to be here because they were either just deja vu borrowing heavily from Metallica Zolder material or they just felt redundant within the tracklisting itself on this thing if load and reload had been part of a trilogy which this album was completing this record would have been titled overload still though there are elements generally about this record that I can praise and that is that in some ways this record does feel like a bit of a return to form for Metallica the production generally is pretty good the performances are decent there are some highlights in terms of writing there are a couple moments here in the error feels like Metallica is making their compositions a little more dynamic with more guitar layering more vocal layering to make things a little more melodic and harmonious though it's not like they do that so often that it feels like they're really kind of pushing forward and experimenting and really changing their sound or doing something different doing something exciting this is very much like a meat and potatoes kind of Metallica album in many ways and while that may not sound exciting it's at least good to hear Metallica doing themselves justice after so many years I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this record

everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new actress album ghetto ville this is the 4th full-length release from actress aka Darren Jai Cunningham a uk-based electronic music producer I enjoyed the really minimal stripped-down approach that he took to genres like house and techno on his earliest LPS but he sort of lost me a bit on his last full-length album r.i.p an LP that showed Darren's sound moving into some really abstract territory and stringing together a series of tracks that weren't exactly cohesive as an album to me and obviously having an album that was really uniform and style and sound was not the goal of this LP instead Darren seemed to focus a lot more on trying to explore as many sounds textures and moods as possible and there's nothing inherently wrong with a disjointed record but it's the track specifically that didn't end up grabbing me on this LP some of which I found to meander a little bit too much were maybe a little bit too skeletal just weren't putting out anything sonically that was gripping to me I think actresses scatterbrained approach ends up working out for him on this new record though it's sort of a strong change in feeling for me I mean after listening to this record I'm sort of seeing actress in more of the same light as artists like Autechre or Flying Lotus but to me they're only similar in the sense that they make electronic music that is rhythmically driven and is filled with relentless sonic experimentation and another thing that shocked me about this record is how instantaneous it was for me I know that there are a lot of weird ambient abstract challenging sounds on here but even after one listen to this thing I couldn't help but find it really dark moody and gratifying to me this record is simultaneously genre embracing and genre deform an album that shows its influences very obviously but takes that manipulates them twists them into something where it's difficult to tell where something is coming from where something is going away it's cool to see this dude take something as simple as the parameters of house music and break them down and build them back up with dusty drumbeats and textures that remind me of things like asphalt concrete moonlit nights cold hard steel some of the tracks hear loud they're hard-hitting they have strong grooves others are a little bit more ambient and style but still feature some really strange and vivid sounds that that have a really strong sense of place each one of the 16 tracks on this LP has their own unique personality that I could go into pretty deep detail describing it all together these songs spans 70 minutes the song bird cage has this insanely stiff loud and robotic hi-hat kick drum pattern there's a breathy vocal sample on this track some deep bass and I love the sharp sounds of the drums on this track and the track switches back and forth between these robotic drum beats and these drum fills that seem a little foreign with these cheery woodwinds synth leads dancing on top of them I love hearing these really lively pieces of percussion mixed with just this hard-nosed techno beat the opener on this LP also a song that I love incredibly slow a beat that really lurks it's heavy with bass and there's all these stretched out fizzling ride cymbals that play on top of it - there's some icy scents on this track some metallic chimes that just ring out eerily it's a great atmosphere to kick this record off with but it does require some patience because it is a long track it is a track that doesn't exactly come out and bite you I'm sure this song is going to scare away as many people as it pulls in there's another track on here that I love that also hits a super slow stride the song contagious the beat on this song it sounds like a train a coal engine train from Hell just pulling out of the station to bring its passengers to a lifetime of Tom ends and after a lifetime and the really muffled deep slow vocal cuts on this track lead me to believe that these rhythms might just be a part of some larger sample from somewhere else taking what could potentially be just sort of a sexy slow jam and playing at this slow is kind of vaporwave but to me actress takes it one step further by surrounding this track with some really ominous rhythms and synthesizers where actresses take on this sort of budding genre gets a little old as on the song rap where to me the song doesn't feel much more like just a sample of a song sort of played and looped and chopped and whatnot actress does a good job of catching that vaporwave vibe but the song is a little underwhelming on the detail side there's some tracks on this LP that have a gentler side of sorts like the track hour which with these really light light rhythms and these just sparkling thumb piano melodies I'm reminded a bit of people like Pantha new prints or bonobo or the song time which while it isn't really a heavy track it is an incredibly eerie song with a very sour drone hanging in the background with some very tense high hats playing in the foreground there's some odd synthesizer keys that play on this track too and longer this song goes the more frightening it is and some of the tracks on this LP display a somewhat goofier side of actress as well like the song corner which is a bit of slow paced synthesizer funk with these melodic leads that are played so awkwardly over this groove it's kind of hilarious and they're really just overbearing heavy bassline is really what makes this track and the song rims - with these sort of weird upward and downward sliding lead melodies on the track it sounds a little silly it's got these gurgling bass lines as well and I do like the track even if it is less impressive than a lot of the other songs on here my favorite tracks on this LP is where actors might approach just a really simple house 4/4 rhythm with a pretty experimental flare like the really murky track front line where it seems like he tries to strip back as much treble as possible with some pretty nice bass lines on this song - and then there's skyline which is incredibly minimal it's glitchy and there are some weird metallic drones hanging in the background of this track - and I love gays which is maybe the most accessible melodic and celebratory track on this entire album really great undeniable beat with some incredibly bright sense and there are also songs on here that of course contrast this brightness this upbeat attitude in a great way like the song Street Corp which is so robotic with its off-kilter rhythm that it feels like I'm listening to some kind of machine whose job it is to just crank away on some assembly line day-in and day-out the track seems so simple in concept but to me it it says a lot I love a majority of the tracks on this album even if overall the LP is a little scatterbrained and you know at the end of the day this is a record that perfectly reflects its cover art in that it feels sort of like a musical sketchbook something I think the album r.i.p was as well but that album was masquerading as something that was a little bit more refined and was a little bit too reserved because of that get oval nose it's a personal indulgence it does not hide that and it ends up bolder and more intimate because of that even if some of the bridges on this LP lead to nowhere even if there are some tracks on here that do feel a little redundant or inconsequential overall I ended up loving the experience I had with this pretty jarring set of tracks I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think as your review knows and that's it Anthony Fantana actress get oval forever "},{"id":"cndwH6byJnk","title":"Little Women- Throat ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"hey my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an album review little women throat little women is a Brooklyn quartet new album throat seven tracks its pieces one through seven like throat one through seven forty one minutes in total and this album has been blowing my mind for the past few days blowing my mind this review is really going to be for my Avant drops for my noisy needle drops so if you're looking for the next electro pop album you may want to turn back but if you do want your brain scoop out of your skull and hand it to you on a plate then I think you're gonna want to stick around for this now there was a phase in my musical trajectory where I was just listening to a lot of avant-garde music because I just enjoyed the thrill of it a lot of noise music - you know your cage yours or your Branka also minimalist composers like Philip Glass also you guys know I'm heavy into drone listening to a lot of drone listen and the guys like Murs bow pre and stuff like that - also free jazz music and anything that I could kind of get my hands on in mp3 formed from the New York no wave scene bands like DNA and as a result my tastes and it have become a little more picky I'm a little desensitized to it sometimes and it's a you know kind of hard for me to derive the same joy and thrill out of Noise music because it's you know the excitement isn't there now like it was when I was first listening to it so enter Little Women the instrumentation on this LP isn't anything that you haven't heard before in your lifetime you've got tenor saxophone alto saxophone electric guitar and drums and that is it my friends that is it and also want to make a very clear point of this stress this no effects none not that I hear maybe there's some light compression and the post-production something like that but no reverb nope you know distortion no chorus nothing like that nope pitch shifting no experimental weird effects this is raw musicianship here my friends and this raw musicianship translates into really and I'm being honest here one of the most brutal experiences I've ever had with music on an album you've got these flurries of drums that incorporate elements of jazz music like metal music grindcore punk music math rock and you have these horns playing really dissonant intervals of just the tone of the horns in the recording just blaring in your face and you have these really sharp pointy guitar sounds just like kind of crunchy - really just making this album something else just just how aggressive and abusive this sound is I just can't explain but maybe I can liken it to this you guys know like if you were tied up to a pole and you had a blindfold on like you have a cigarette in your mouth and there's like a firing squad in front of you something out of a cartoon or like out of one of those old westerns and you were about to be shot at and executed but instead of rifles everybody in the lineup in front of you actually has fully automatic machine guns with an unlimited amount of rounds okay and once the album turns on they're shooting you and here's and here's the bad part like you know here's here's the bad part you won't die you just won't die so you're just forced to stay there on the pole alive and just you know feeling all the bullets go I mean literally there were points when I was listening to this album I started screaming like I was listening to it I'm just going I was listening to this and almost every time I do if I just have this at a certain you know loud volume this thing needs a loud volume if I had this thing at a loud volume and I'm just really concentrating on and I'm just listening to it no distractions my eyes just go wide as if I was like watching a really gory gory murder occur right in front of me like I'm just listening to the murder of music now I'm gonna link you to this band's MySpace the first track off throat is on there at least at the time of me making this video give that a listen there are a lot of tracks on this LP that are like that I want to say about 1 to 4 the tracks on this album are really cut of that extremely aggressive disorienting cloth you do have another track on there that is very slow very stripped-down no guitar no drums just the two horns and they're making like these really just sour notes that are just like you know just it's like after the first round of being shot and then another track kicks and you're being shot again you know it's another disorienting experience on the fourth track which is my favorite and the longest on the album is actually quite beautiful very pretty very harmonized horns on that one and the chord progressions on that track are just really emotionally you know just hit home with me I guess you could say and the drumming on that is very great too I mean it's it's honestly a pretty track you know I mean of course that's objective but um it's a very pretty pretty track compared to the rest of what's on this album and yeah I enjoy it probably the most out of all the tracks but I enjoy it for a different reason than I enjoy the other tracks you know I'm enjoying it because traditionally when we're talking about music and musicality it's more traditionally musical you know it has things that are more widely accepted in greater society to be musical like pretty notes and pretty harmonies and a chord progression and a you know consists didn't see an interesting rhythm it's a pretty track it breaks down into some ugliness here and there but you know it is a very pleasant track I would say and then you had the last track where it sounds like all the members of the group are trying to choke themselves to death and there's like man also add the guitarist Mick bar drew the picture on the front cover of this album if you're in the technical stuff if you're into experimental metal music I don't think you need a better endorsement than that I don't know if there's anything else I could say about this album other than that it just drove me insane yeah it did really disorient in the experience and I highly highly recommend it really I do I think I could give this a late-night yeah this is like this is really fucked up you should listen to it forever "},{"id":"eQ3Wd60Qddw","title":"MGMT - Little Dark Age ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Pavan II cast Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new MGMT album little Dark Age this is the latest full-length LP from New York pop duo MGMT who hit it pretty big in the 2000s thanks to unforeseen hits such as electric feel and time to pretend and kids all great tracks but Ben and Andrew didn't seem all that interested in maintaining their musical momentum in the mainstream because almost immediately after putting out or ocular spectacular they started to release very strange and long-winded bits of music such as Metanoia and then followed this up with their 2010 album congratulations which was fun but kind of uncompromising and also my favorite record the duo had released at that time the album overall seemed like a deeper embrace of the quirky experimental but very fun characteristics that made them interesting to start there were also epic and multi-phase moments on this thing like siberian breaks some very funny hero worship such as the song brain you know and then the closer the title track of this thing is one of the most epic and and heartwarming ballads the duo have ever penned they followed this LP up in 2013 with a self-titled album that was a bit of a head-scratcher I can't appreciate that with each record MGMT seeks to do something entirely different but this record was really unkempt lo-fi to a fault under written under produced really under under everything I mean it wasn't the worst thing in the world but to me it kind of read like a band having a difficult time adjusting to the musical landscape of the next decade and also it just kind of felt like the the reception of this album was so negative how could they possibly recover but last year they started to drop teaser singles to this new record over here little dark age all of which piqued my interest and for casted the duo going into an entirely different direction just straight synth pop but with kind of a haunted aesthetic to it like there were definitely some petshop boy and Thompson twin vibes coming off these tracks also a splash of aerial pink in the mix - or maybe more than a splash the song James sounds like a dead ringer for track that that could have fit on like that the before today record the Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti album before today on this track there's even kind of this goofy baritone singing that is like kind of Ariel Pink's calling card this eerie similarity caused me to go look up the writing and production credits on this thing and of course Ariel pink is credited with co-writing at least one song on this thing the song when you dies so I'm not really surprised I picked that up hey MGMT ripoff Ariel Pink's super friggin hard on this record don't be that person that like just listens to this record and you don't listen to Ariel pink please listen - Ariel pink - he's a really great musician he's a really great songwriter lots of good albums in his discography but it's it's almost kind of ridiculous how much MGMT pull from him on this album clearly it was a bit of a mutual thing given the aerial help them with this record in a way but still you know listened to Ariel Pink's music for the love of God the sound of this record is really nostalgic but there's obviously a kind of modern silliness and sense of humor to it it just adds an anachronistic quality to this very vintage style of pop and this very fun aesthetic follows through on pretty much every song here of course there are cuts that feature a little bit more acoustic instrumentation but still the synths do carry at least some presence and even when they're not here in full force there's still an undeniable eeriness that cannot be shaken from a lot of these tracks a lot of the songs on this thing are oddly spooky and kind of frightening and a little morbid it's totally new wave but there's also something a little Goffe about it - kind of tongue-in-cheek as well whatever the mix of moods and influences that are coming together on this album is MGMT pull it off really well and they pull it off very consistently but even though I like the aesthetic and the instrumentation on this album quite a bit my long-term enjoyment of this record really comes down to the sticky unforgettable hooks the songwriting and the very dark absurd and unlikely song topics like the track she works out too much which kicks the entire record off a song that's essentially about a relationship on the rocks because because the guy is not very physically active I guess maybe it's a metaphor or a piece of symbolism for something else I'm not entirely sure but I don't think that's the case in a way the song at its core seems to be about a relationship ending or dying on the vine over just a lack of common interests or different personality types but of course that very common theme is made to sound kind of silly or put into a kind of unique light with all of these funny exercise references a very fun groovy danceable beat and bassline think of the song is like the antithesis to Kanye's new workout plan then there is the track ts lamp which stands for time spent looking at my phone which is a partly schmaltzy partly surreal partly eerily accurate song about phone addiction I love the smooth groove the nocturnal bassline the dreamy swell of instrumentation on the hook the dead on lyrics Jesus Christ then we have the track me and Michael which is a really cute endearing sweet song about friendship I love the gently pulsating since on this thing the twinkling guitars I like be cool assuring lead vocals on this thing - the way it's sung just kind of feels like a bit of a one-on-one conversation which is totally contrasted by the angry and and confrontational when you die which is like a bit of groovy acoustic rock with some very prickly lyrics saying I mean I'm evil I'm not nice go fuck yourself the instrumentation is super catchy and very sweet in a lot of ways but just the nastiness coming off the lyrics it's kind of hilarious the song when you're small is a very haunting ballad with a lot of space around the core instrumentation and vocals the duo definitely does their best to use production to kind of make the music feel like I don't know that it's it's in a gargantuan space or give the listener the feeling of that they're falling into some kind of abyss or shrinking in slow motion like Alice in Wonderland and even though the song on its surface is about physical size there are definitely issues of I guess emotional and mental insecurities being addressed here in the song - or I guess physical size being used as a symbol to address those things I also love the haunting reverb laid on to the Harmonized cultish vocals on the hook here the trippy effects and instrumental overdubs that kind of flash up here and there which this isn't even the only point on the album where that happens there's quite a bit of that over the course of the entire album where you hear you know little instrumental flourishes or people talking and laughing just weird effects just add a little bit more color and context to the instrumentation you're hearing or the lyrics that are being sung and the closing track handed over if I am to read this song correctly to me feels like a meditation on the duo struggle to remain relevant in the music industry it's very cold and intriguing finish to the entire album but for me the crown jewel of the record has to be a song that for me is one of the hardest to interpret and that's the title track little dark age a track that I've been enamored with since the moment I heard it as a single but even though the meaning of the song isn't super apparent on its face I do love the imagery and the cryptic lyrics on this thing as well as the disembodied vocals singing throughout the track be very murky baseline throbbing synthesizers on the hook stellar chord progression and if any track on this album embodies the goth aesthetic that pops up here and there throughout this record it's this one overall really loving this record really enjoying it not too much in the way of a gargantuan theme or concept running throughout the entire album it just kind of seems like a nice loose collection of very memorable songs that are tied together relatively tightly with a very focused aesthetic nothing more nothing less good sense of melody of style of songwriting on this album I'm glad MGMT are kind of back in a lot of ways on this record have have sort of overcome a lot of the faults of their previous album there are a few cuts on here that felt like to me created a bit of a lull in the tracklist mostly the song James which again feels like an aerial pink Xerox as well as the instrumental days that got away which just read to me is alright but still enjoying the album a lot feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review

Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of one of coucher chest his favorite bands what a cow's favorite band eat the booty like pac-man 1975 with the amazing title I like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it the creepiest creeper album title I've ever heard in my entire life this is a sophomore full-length LP from this UK pop rock outfit and I can't really say I enjoy their debut I think there were a few decent singles off of this thing but for the most part as an entire record I thought the songs and the production were just a little too clean slick and sanitary to really suck me in and I can't really say I was intrigued to listen to this new LP either especially since the cover of this new album and the cover of the band's last album are almost identical and just to me that communicates well wouldn't this just be like the same album over again isn't this just like simply a sequel or something but you guys are really insistent that I try this thing out and that I hear this thing and that I review this thing and usually when I get so many requests for a group that I have not expressly said before that I enjoy or I haven't like really reviewed thoroughly before maybe there's been some kind of change of pace maybe some reason to celebrate maybe something to be excited about you know the man could have turned a new leaf and I'm open to enjoying the music of a group that I didn't previously enjoy not everybody makes the same music or the same sound forever change is inevitable so was there a change here and did it appeal to me well on this new project over here the band's sound is still pretty far from original I don't think they've come any closer to putting together a distinct sound that I recognize as being oh this is what a 1975 song is I instantly recognized this band as the 1975 but they are sounding much less like the simple basic overly sanitized pop rock band that they on their last record right from the gate this record hits me with a series of songs that are very funky playful pop throwbacks not really from 1975 more like from 1985 specifically on the song Love Me which sounds borrowed straight out of the Huey Lewis and the news playbook not only that but it seems like 1975 or taking a cue from artists like Mark Ronson who also pulled from that playbook or people like Carly Rae Jepsen who also pulled from a similar era of pop music on her latest record you know more from artists like Paula Abdul but it seems like in the mainstream the 80s are having a little comeback but in the case of this Love Me song I think the 1975 are a little more bombastic with it I love just the gunshot snares on this thing the room but those are some really nice guitar licks really sweet and sour rhythm guitar right there and the bass has a great groove to it hmm the 1975 came through the track on this thing that I thought was fantastic so already we're off to a really great start the band goes much smoother on the song which is a track that I think could have fit a little more snug ly into their last full-length album though it does seem to have still an 80s throwback vibe to it and the guitars even though the song is a lot lighter than that love me track are still pretty flavorful the synths are glistening plus the very tight bass and drum groove on this track seems a little Michael Jackson inspired and even though it is a little overly sugary I like the song she's American - I thought the moment in the refrain where the band is singing about having her teeth or having his teeth fixed was pretty funny so we're not even done with the first half of the LP and there are already some good pop highlights on here but there are some softer cuts in the first half here that I don't really care for at all here the band really fails to appeal to me in any kind of way like on the song change of heart the very stiff drum machine beats and the ethereal instrumentation and the cloying on this thing are just all borderline sickening however I don't really mind the ballot on here if I believe you mostly because it seems like such a weird combination of sounds some of which the 1975 might have picked up on accidentally I'm not sure it's like the band is fusing slow sensual R&B with the kind of ultra vulnerable ballad writing that you would catch from an artist like perfume genius and then there's like a big gospel style chorus finish that came out of nowhere and there are some religious themes turning up in the lyrics here with a you know love interest tie-in it's definitely one of the better tunes on this thing though still again I wish the vocals on this thing had a little bit more grit conviction fire or maybe sort of portrayed a little bit more vulnerability most of the time they just kind of had this very smooth effeminate demeanor to them that you know just seems so dime a dozen these days when you're listening to a lot of male singers in the top 40 the band pulls another left hook and takes a risk with the song please be naked one of a couple tracks on here that I totally did not expect to just be instrumental and sort of electronic too even the title track what I thought was going to be more of a centerpiece on here turns out to be a little bit more than a detour with some very sweet and somewhat bubbly electronics considering that this record is just over an hour long the 1975 not previously a band that I would want to hear a full-length album from much less a full-length album that is an hour long so I'm kind of sitting here thinking it has the band really shown up until this point that they can write an hour of material that is fantastic from beginning to end at least one of these tracks could have been excusable if it was a short concise record and especially if it was kind of transitioning the record from one mood or one sound or one batch of tracks to another but instead it just kind of drowns in a sea of songs which really could have been cut back mostly toward the tail end though after please be naked I don't mind the sequencing here the song right after this my head the band I think takes another risk and takes things down a bit of a shoegaze erode although the track does run pretty long on the end is sort of flaccid because I feel like the band is sort of done everything they can in terms of intensity and volume it's like the 1975 genuinely wants to experiment with some of these sounds but they don't know how to keep them intriguing or you know just like continue to advance them for an entire track but again not every experiment were for Rey into another sound or genre is fulfilling like those somewhat indie tronic little instrumental detours I talked about or like on Ballad of me in my brain where deeper under the track the mix is just so filled with instrumentation layers and sound that it becomes an unnecessary clutter which is also true of the song the sound which features these dance drumbeats and these cacophonous scents and these really sunny sugar-sweet Passion Pit s background vocals and the song this must be my dream too I mean a track that is just so overloaded and simultaneously is like a reminder a good reminder of why the 80s had to end because not only are these sax solos and bass grooves tired today but the band had already exhausted them at this point on the album why are they revisiting them with so much less mmm there's just a point where this album stops being fun which is a shame because it had a good start it stops being fun and it just starts getting stale as they just rehash very uncreative ly these influences that they seem to be borrowing from in the most shallow and cursory ways add to that the lack of distinct vocals and and interesting lyrics and then the album's last few moments are just not interesting at all as we get some of the most breezy most easygoing cuts on the entire project that are just not engaging that there was a point with this project where I was hopeful and I was enjoying it but it was just a small sliver of the tracklist here toward the beginning I feel like this thing could have either been pared down into a gray EP or a somewhat decent commercial record that is like 30 to 40 minutes in length but instead we've got over an hour of material here much of it is bland much of it is uninteresting and much of it just borrows from a bunch of tired clich√©s from the 80s in the worst way vast majority of the time this 80s pop pastiche has no real substance behind it you know it's it's just a record they had a lot of potential but the fact that it's so bloated with all these unnecessary tracks and and filler there's not a huge concept going on here we're talking about three minutes songs which get old fast especially when you're talking about a band that does not have that distinct of a sound you know I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing unfortunately transition have you given the sound listen as you love it did you hate it what would you rate it universe universe what should I review next hit that light if you like the 1975 I like it when you sleep thank you for watching I appreciate it hope you're doing well forever "},{"id":"oiNIJAQWUbY","title":"Run the Jewels - Run the Jewels 2 ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fangio here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new run the jewels record run the jewels did run the jewels is a hip hop duo consisting of southern rapper killer Mike and new york-based rapper producer LP these guys have been one of the most unlikely and super hyped rap team ups of the past few years they started turning heads in 2012 with the entirely LP produced killer Mike album rap music which was highly praised by both fans and critics and LP n killer Mike seeing the success off of this record and basically the chemistry they themselves rivers we're seeing in their creative process decided to solidify this duo with the name run the jewels and they dropped a full-length record just about a year after this killer Mike album even though LP and might come from different walks of life they've had different artistic trajectories when it comes to run the jewels they really get on the same page artistically they kind of get together and meet at this middle ground where they can be straightforward blunt super aggressive brutal but also kind of cunning and clever too a little adventurous I think LP skips a little bit on the wordplay on the technical ability I think killer Mike drops a bit of his southern flavor from the equation too and this is all for the sake of coming together and doing something that is uniquely them still even though this first record of theirs really hit it off the question remains that can they continue this and hold people's attention can they keep it fresh can they keep it entertaining can they come up with some new ideas how far can this newly formed oooooo go are we going to get another black star or can we progress past this first album into something just as good Mike and Jamie certainly seem to hope that that's the case because it looks like they're marketing this album as a sequel to the first album Plus on top of it they're dropping this record just a year after they put out their debut record I guess really hitting while the iron's hot but still a lot of hardcore fans are going to have that debut album in their recent memory and they're going to hear this wasn't going to okay which is a completely fine reaction to have if you feel that way but in my personal opinion I think rtj 2 is better there are super brutal violent and aggressive rhymes all over this record cartoon alee aggressive sometimes hilariously aggressive sometimes as well but I think LP and killer Mike have stumbled upon a newfound just like serious darkness on this record - on some of these tracks I think LPS production on this record in comparison with the debut is way more layered detailed it's got more melody - on some of these tracks it's heavier it's busier it's punch here these beats are weighty and together with the lyrics these songs are about is blunt and straightforward and hard-hitting as like a wall of the coolest graffiti - tumbling over on top of you some of these songs feature numerous parts or have wonderful segues toward the end of them that bring you right into the next track without losing any momentum on the record like the track oh my darling into blockbuster night or all due respect into love again like with the last record Jamie and Mike bring just a handful of features but the features they do bring are super impressive Travis Barker of blink-182 hammering it out on drums on one track we also have Zack de la Rocha of raging as the Machine and gangsta boo of three 6 mafia they're not messing around and a few Underground's somewhat unknowns as well Diane Coffey who you might know as a member or a collaborator drummer for Fox again as well as boots a new york-based songwriter who on this record helped lay down one of the most beautiful choruses on any hip-hop album this year as I said earlier I think LP and killer Mike are finding their dark side on this record are finding a way to make slower more toned-down songs entertaining they do it right at the start of this record with the track jeopardy which is a really odd track for run the jewels they're lurking bass lines all over this thing just like eerie horror movies synthesizers and lead guitars some synth swells once the beat kicks in it's really heavy its lumbering and they're like some kooky saxophone leads all over this thing to LP and Mike bring these really slowly paced gritty grimy verses that really build up the the evil of this record like this song isn't the most evil that the album gets but you know that there's a larger evil coming down the pipe there are other tracks on here too that are equally toned down but a little darker just a little more depressing or even sad at times like the song all my life or even crown where killer Mike is delivering this eye widening lease adverse where he's rapping about dealing drugs to a pregnant woman regretfully however throughout the rest of this record run the jewels is the typically head bashing duo that you've come to know this is like some action movie shit with like LP and killer Mike running in slow motion with like trucks filled with gasoline exploding behind them and like Isis terrorists all around them like shooting at them with their fully automatic assault rifles but like every bullets missing like with the song Omar which has one of the most massive instrumentals on the entire LP really heavy sub bass simple snares coming through some watery swirling keys LP delivers some pimp sea references and some big references there's a hilarious line where he says that someone should run backwards through a field of dicks the instrumental gets noisier and more chaotic as it continues the song isn't exactly delivering any food for thought or anything like that but the lyrics and just the overall tone of the song is hilariously badass same with the song close your eyes and count to fuck LP and killer Mike also deliver some brutal verses here and we have Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine like I mentioned earlier on this beat he is laced into the instrumental itself and it sounds amazing however his verse isn't totally mind-blowing or anything like that but I do think it's better than his appearance on the recent Deltron 3030 record we've got the song lie cheat steal which one of my favorite images on this entire record comes from this song teabagging a piranha tank or the song love again which has another incredibly hefty catchy beat and gangsta boo delivers a verse that is so raunchy that I blushed a little bit nearly every other track on here that isn't you know sort of sadder or more toned down song is it outright banger and I love that about this record but I also love the LP and killer Mike came together and and put forward a full length that is more balanced as well there are some darker tones on this LP and some of the most melodic hooks that LP and killer Mike have delivered yet especially on this track that features Diane Coffey to me this record is run the jewels sounding more distinct sounding more dynamic despite their incredibly aggressive attitudes I think they took some risks on this LP and the results are positive there are a few tracks here the pale in comparison to others but I don't really think there's anything incredibly negative that I have to say about this LP sometimes the more aggressive lyrics on this record can be a little cringe-worthy but that's the kind of tone and story that this album chooses to put forward it's unreasonably mean I mean look at the cover here it is a stick-up going on it doesn't want to hear your sob stories run the jewels man here and there I wish there were some beats that were just a little bit louder so the vocals were we're more immersed in them as opposed to just feeling like killer Mike and LP were just sort of on top of them with just kind of a lot of space between them and the beat some small technical things here and there pretty much but I'm still feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana have a nice day music forever "},{"id":"C0C-ZtZapNM","title":"First Aid Kit - Ruins ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone les that he do tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new first aid kit album ruins this is the 4th full-length album from Swedish folk pop duo first aid kit who I first stumbled upon in 2012 like most people did through their breakout album lion's roar the record wasn't one of my favorites of the year but I did walk away from it pretty impressed impressed by the sisters tight vocal harmonies rustic instrumentation dramatic songwriting style and it was sad to see some of that kind of evaporate on their follow-up albums state gold a few years later which was a slightly more measured and glitzy release by comparison while the instrumentation did seem bigger than ever totally soaked in reverb there was something kind of sterile about this record in my opinion the presentation of the music seemed like a little more mainstream and kind of watered down first aid kits sound wasn't nearly as cheap and as groovy and as melodramatic as like a band such as the Lumineers but there was definitely something about this record that kind of made me lose touch with the emotional connection that I had with their previous work despite the sisters very unique vocal chemistry fortunately ruins takes things in a bit more organic direction with a new flood of sound and instrumentation this thing is not simply a full chrec 'red I mean there's a lot of electric instrumentation on this thing these sisters are now dabbling in elements of country and Americana on quite a few tracks of this thing kind of pulling from the back catalogs of artists like Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris the duo's core songwriting characteristics haven't really changed all that much though quite a few songs on this thing still feature their cheek-to-cheek harmonies that typically reach into their upper registers soaring over swelling Fulk instrumentation on the chorus an effect that is enhanced by the extra layers of guitar and percussion and strings on a lot of these tracks case in point the song it's a shame great galloping epic folk pop tune and there are moments on this record where they're kind of breaking away a little bit from the incessant vocal harmonies to deliver some singing that is a little bit more stark and raw intimate the song postcard is an example + on this track there is a little bit of what sounds like pedal steel or some very nice sweet slide guitar a bit of a backwater groove too easily one of the route SIA songs the duo has ever put together and the song fireworks is this really sweet ballad in three that has a very humble simple introduction and the song gets more and more lush and dense and layered as it progresses and it just kind of hits this really epic finish against some dancing strings and a swinging drumbeat but even though I like that the sisters are changing things up sometimes their approaches to these genres outside the Fulk world can be a little basic like on the song to live a life which is not really one of the most entertaining tracks on the track listing here plus when we're looking at the lyrics sometimes I get the sense that whiskey and wine and driving on the interstate is about as Americana as these two Swedes get so truth be told there are some moments on this record where first aid kit doesn't really have quite as much bite as they did on their earlier material quite as much urgency there are moments on this thing that go a little middle-of-the-road and predictable the slightly new direction this album goes in doesn't drum up quite as many surprises as I had hoped for and depending on who you talk to first aid kits unwavering dedication to this harmonized vocal style on every record thus far could either sound like them just sticking to their guns or painting themselves into a corner however I would argue that this album on the whole and its best tracks their appeal doesn't really come down to their risk factor but rather their warm welcoming comfortable familiar and enchanting vibe and for the most part the grandeur louder larger more refined full chimeric on a country instrumentation on this thing enhances that I mean there are some spots on this thing where the duo's music almost becomes as epic as like a Fleet Foxes song occasionally the gargantuan size of these tracks kind of gets away from the duo or doesn't come off quite as spectacular as I think they had hoped like the chorus of drunken horns and Lala's at the end of hem of her dress just comes off like really ham-fisted to me kind of reminds me of some of the worst and most gimmicky days of the indie folk revolution of the 2000s you know like some really annoying Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros type stuff and for all of its volume and noise the final moments of the closing track on this thing just came off a little too measured I mean I like that they try to bring things to a distorted crescendo so that it's really an explosive ending but the pacing up until that point is just way too measured to feel like you're progressing toward anything that's really as freewheeling and really as wild as I think they want you to feel it is with the volume all that being said though a great deal of the tracks on this album are good and well written and well performed and well recorded and produced I'm just a little hung up over the fact that I feel like some of the shortcomings of this album just keep it just ever so slightly back from being the great album it had the potential to be because I do think that ruins was really close to being the duo's best record however I feel it's fallen a bit short still though this thing is packed with rich Fulk instrumentation tried-and-true chord progressions obviously the vocal performances are good and I'm sure most listeners looking for some very direct and to-the-point full pop are gonna enjoy this thing nearly from front to back I'm feeling a light to decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it too

music nerd and it's time for review of the new Mac DeMarco album this old dog neck DeMarco was a singer-songwriter white guy from Canada captured tracks artists and a viceroy smoker and now he's back with another album which I have been looking forward to not only because I knew it was going to be one of the bigger releases of the year but this is the record that I was crossing my fingers and hoping that Mac DeMarco would come through with an album that didn't just play like a compilation of songs sort of my primary issue with his album number two his big breakout album though not my only issue a lot of good tracks on that record though I thought the kind of jangly smooth very dreamy pop rock he delivered on this record could have used a bit of variety especially on the follow-up album salad days where I feel like that sound really turned drab very fast I came away from salad days feeling so underwhelmed but felt weirdly hopeful when I read some talk of Mac DeMarco butting heads with his record label over the creative direction of the album a bit thinking that hey maybe if Mac DeMarco had more full control over the record I would have liked it more after all I did end up enjoying that another one EP that he released shortly thereafter and captured tracks dropped quite a few teaser tracks up to the release of this album so it was kind of easy to see where Mac DeMarco was going to be taking this record with the emphasis on synthesizers songs that lyrically seemed way more sad and introspective Mac's usually happy-go-lucky very blissful vibe was kind of melting away a bit and that is swapped out with tracks that kind of reflect the pain of loneliness and Mac DeMarco struggled to grow up in mature to become his own man outside of the shadow of his father who he has a troubled past with given that he abandoned him and his mother when he was young this is a sight of Mac DeMarco that we have not seen explored before we're at this depth and even though it may not seem like much because Mac DeMarco doesn't really tend to load his songs with a lot of instrumentation with a lot of sound he plays it pretty subtle he plays it pretty simple the addition of drum machines and the synthesizers and more acoustic guitars into the mix on this thing actually does bring more variety to the record makes the album sound more dynamic more engaging even if on the whole this album still feels very easygoing and somewhat breezy I guess now that sound makes a more interesting match and more interesting juxtaposition against the increasingly grim and somewhat depressing lyrics that are laced throughout the album like on dreams from yesterday or one more love song as I listen to this record it feels like I'm watching some kind of slow motion video Mac DeMarco descending into some kind of moody abyss whose depth and intensity grows as the album goes on like when Mac DeMarcos vocals are drenched in echo on the very Spacey on the level whose verses swap out with these very smooth elongated and icy icy icy synth lines the song moonlight on the river closes out with this very chaotic and abrasive wall of guitar noise and frightening sound effects as lyrically on the track he kind of reflects on his father abandoning him and his mother which is a bit of a narrative on the record he puts to bed on the closing track where he is reflecting instead on his father dying and even though he didn't really kind of have that relationship with him over the years you never really got to know his father personally like that it still hurts to know that he's not going to be on this planet anymore Mac DeMarco struggles on this track to call him up to really do anything to reach out or even tell him off for all the years of abandonment now this album isn't all doom and gloom Mac DeMarco does still bring a handful of funky playful I guess awkwardly sensual instrumentals that I like quite a bit the song for the first time I think is one of his best love songs in a while really up there in my opinion with my kind of woman it's just like seeing for the first time I love how smooth and sweet that song is I like how the song is just a soft and gentle but there's also kind of something that's playful about it flirty about it but shy too on the track one another we get a little bit of a Velvet Underground vibe coming through on the groove and some of the guitar licks on the track I love the opening of the track of wolf in sheep's clothing at our licks and harmonicas as well kind of seems like as a bit of a classic rock vibe to it and dreams of yesterday has like some undertones of bossa nova to it I'd say there are a lot of instrumental qualities about this record that I love Mac DeMarco seems to do a lot with a little on this album the bass lines and the drums play a pretty straight the acoustic guitars really only serve as a rhythm track a lot of the time it's really about some of these guitar leads some of these siblings mac DeMarcos lyrics and vocals the songwriting sometimes is just so sturdy you really don't need to gussy it up in order to to get across what makes the tune so good however not all Tunes on this album were created equal which is kind of a continuing issue for me on Mac DeMarco albums just the inconsistency in the quality of the writing and not that there's an incredible nosedive with some awful lyrics flying at you in every direction or something like that it's just that some songs here feel somewhat unfinished of the end very abruptly they don't have an ending it all or they're just painfully short like Mac didn't fully commit to just fleshing the song out to its proper finish sister the the wolves and sheeps close the gems track meanwhile other tracks such as this old dog I think could have used a starker course or just more instrumental change ups to make the song feel more dynamic these tracks feel just kind of flat to me like there just wasn't enough progression across the track and on the track baby you're out one of the least pleasant instrumental decisions is made to sort of include this little keyboard part that I it doesn't enhance the groove of the track it doesn't enhance the melody or bring a melodic element to the track that's all that interesting it sort of juts out and ruins the smooth groovy tone of the song is really it's it's it's one of the worst sand corporations of since on the entire record actually the worst incorporation of cents on the entire record I have no idea where this you know sort of comes from it's it's really poison to me every time I hear the song it really ruins the tune for me is something that would have otherwise been a decent track in my opinion while this album may be a bit of a mixed bag you know I didn't come away thinking that Mac DeMarco made the best use of all 40-plus minutes of this album I do think this is his best record since - not only because of the instrumental diversity across this record but also just how interesting some of the the songs and lyrics are on this record I feel like we're just getting a side of mac DeMarco that we have not gone before not to this degree and I've also noticed he's matured quite a bit in his songwriting and his lyricism for this record - something I highly commend but while I like this record coming away from it I'm not so sure if it's you know going to hit if it's going to pop if it's going to make waves like his previous releases did because I do think this is a patient listeners album people looking for those purely feel good vibes from Max earlier releases might not get that on this record not to say this is a negative album but you know it is very introspective and somewhat moody record I think Mac did a good job of mostly getting his sound to apply to this new lyrical direction but you know this is this is not a - still though it's working for me I came away liking this record I think it's very good I'm feeling a strong 7 - a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you

Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new father John misty album pure comedy singer/songwriter Josh Tillman aka father John misty aka farmer John misery aka Papa John lunch me aka feather Jam ministries aka fucking jerk missed me aka faster wan whiskey aka fava-bean Pepsi he is on his third full-length album under this moniker he has released a myriad of albums under the Jay Tillman name years ago peer comedy over here follows Josh Tillman's second father John misty album the excellently lovey dovey I love you honey bear wish that record is a beautiful record of self dissection of affection of commitment it's an album that is as smart as it is moving to your Josh Tillman I think really honed his talents for writing these grand musical gestures that are laced with these very blunt sharp witty pieces of lyrical satire so blunt in fact that his sense of humor has a bit of a grim tone to it you know it's kind of like getting hit with a baseball bat on fire wrapped in barbed wire that's a bar and it's that wits that satire it's that drive to sort of critique the world at large that had me pretty excited to listen to this new album over here because judging from everything I heard from this record up to this album seemed like Joshua's just going to be doing that on a much bigger scale to the point where he's kind of getting down to the Nitty Gritty of what's ailing the human race itself whether it be politically socially philosophically religiously now just the length alone of this record I would say makes it a grander statement on these issues I mean this thing is 80 minutes long and I would say on this record that Tillman's statements are generally bolder stronger more pointed he really kind of gives off this attitude of not givin a fuck at least not about who his opinions alienate or what bridges he may be burning with a track like leaving LA a ruthless 13 minute takedown of the entertainment industry here's just one verse from that which I thought was sort of brutal and even on this very track Tillman doesn't escape from his own criticisms recognising the fact that he's become this cliche of the super self-serious white singer-songwriter who's going to preach the listener about you know what's so shitty about the world they live in and for sure there are moments on this record where Tillman plays the role of the verbose sad sobering folk stir or piano man but there are moments where he plays with that role to kind of lampooning it a little bit or at least being self-aware enough to comment on his status and his abilities as a singer-songwriter and dissect his image as far as a public figure - one of my favorite tracks on this record Ballad of the dying man a song that's essentially about somebody who's so in love with his own ideas and opinions that when he's on his deathbed when he's at the threshold of passing away his number one worry is who's going to critique all the thumb of those in the one-percenters the guy is even portrayed is like checking his newsfeed before he passes on so that he sees what he's a about to miss and I can see this track as Tillman kind of lighting an effigy of themselves on fire a little bit but simultaneously taking shots at people who are culture writers in the internet age and you know take themselves a little too seriously this record brings my favorite kind of negative viewpoint of the world it's the sort of pessimism that while it acknowledges that that everything around it is shitty it just can't help but laugh at it you know let's just make a joke out of mankind's endless cycle of self-inflicted wounds and while deep down Josh most likely wishes he had the fix for a lot of the problems that he's singing about on this record I think he's just as content to be you know riding the a bomb that ends all of our lives within a cowboy hat and air like major Kong and dr. Strangelove some of the issues Josh sings about on this record seem like dough why are we still dealing with this others seem a little more inherent at least according to him that pretty much seems to be the concept of the title track on this thing itself Josh sees these issues of mankind prevailing right at the very start of our lives is through the birthing process in this opening verse well it turns out nature's design has some flaws Josh I think also explores human nature a little bit on the track when the God of love returns there'll be hell to pay sort of portraying I think what looks like this a rapture esque scenario where God comes back and is discussed by the world we've sort of created for ourselves but then that criticism that judgment is thrown right back in the face of that God like well you know you left us with this really unjust world like what was it a thing was going to happen bro also when my favorite lines on the entire record turns up on this track to where Josh refers to human beings as earth's most soulful predator and their moments on this record where we're very much in the past very much at the root of what he sees as mankind's problems other moments he's pushing things toward the future like on total entertainment forever where he gives us this scenario where mankind's obsession with keeping itself entertained puts us in a world where you know we're having sex with Taylor Swift through virtual reality it's this matrix like world where it doesn't really matter everybody's kind of plugged into the same thing rich or poor the channels are all the same they're tons of celebratory pianos and horns all over this track that make it really peppy grandiose and beautiful in fact the instrumentation sounds so pretty it's almost a sales pitch for this soul sapped dystopia that Josh Tillman has spun out sort of like you know good piece of sci-fi also kind of the case on the track things it would have been helpful to know before the Revolution where we get this image of a society that seems to have overthrown the government overthrown the the world of industry too and now we've kind of gone back to this hunter-gatherer sort of economy in this post-apocalyptic Mad Max Ian kind of world Tillman tries to escape the world's problems though on the song birdie or at least kind of portray this bird as a form of escapism because this bird sort of flies through the sky high above and far away from us trying to perfectly engineer our world our societies and Tilghman portrays it as impossible perfection to scenario where it seems like the cure is even worse than the cancer itself I get a sense of escapism off of the track a bigger paper bag to where it seems like Tillman is using alcohol drugs and ego to kind of shield himself or build up his status build up his image build up his self-worth but then pairs this with some really self dissecting refrains of what a fraud what a con this could also be a critique being lobbed to him by his own audience or kind of the the music writer public pretty much everything Josh touches and talks about on this record he goes through very methodically very thoroughly really thinks about what he wants to say and then says a lot about it however this a really fantastic quality about the album does falter a bit toward the end on tracks like a smoochie for example a song that sounds like it's about his wife encouraging him through these really dark depressive spells which you you would have to figure a guy like Josh would would go through given that he is so concerned and I guess so aware of just how shit the world is but he doesn't really give these potentially intense throws of depression much more than a lyrical footnote on this record it's not really something that he goes into what the depth that he does many other things on this album same for the track two wildly different perspectives while I do appreciate the observation that yes politically and socially things do seem really polarized right now Josh's observations here are not much more than surface level he does go pretty deep into the topic of age though on the track growing old on Magic Mountain a grand ballad about what seems like a man's last night of raising hell and living without regrets and just kind of burning the barn down this guy is watching his youth slip away but he's trying to take advantage of this last moment he has with it the track eventually builds up to this very droney heavy epic instrumental climax that I like a lot gives the album a real touch that's a sense of finality feels like a grand finish for the record but this is not the end of the album if anything this is kind of like maybe the the finish or the credits rolling or something because the last last track in 20 years or so is like a bit of an epilogue and essentially this track comes down to one simple statement that this doesn't matter it's not really going to matter in a few decades it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things of the universe because really all we are is a speck on a speck on a speck which you know I get that that's fine with me all the more reasons say fuck it bring on the Taylor Swift oculus rifts bitch as far as the production of the sound the instrumentation on this thing it's immaculate it's very well recorded it's very well mixed just like the last album you know that there's obviously still kind of an instrumental a sonic similarity here between what Josh Tillman is doing on this father John misty record and like maybe the last Fleet Foxes album it's very very Airy it's very open it's very pretty Josh brings a lot of different sounds on this thing whether it be some lavishly arranged piano ballads that are very tender very refined some exciting fiery passionate piano rock some acoustic ballads a track or two that has more of a gospel tone a couple that take on more of a country tone the weird distorted experimental vocals on the track the memo which is one of the most conceptual of the entire album especially as you're getting like the weird sort of talking background vocals kind of adding this very funny tongue-in-cheek context with these little stupid vapid statements behind what Josh Tillman is trying to say in his music it's sort of like hey you know I'm here trying to make this statement here and tell you guys something but people who are listening to the record don't really get it they're just fucking morons or at least that's what I took away from it there's thoughts were they're heavy instrumental interludes that are just again really grand really reaching just oh so ambitious and powerful this thing is so dramatic it's so theatrical it's so intimate it's so well thought out a lot of the time too then there's what is just the personality of the album and there's a lot of that this album is immensely funny immensely depressing it's heartfelt it's sincere but also has incredible moments of cynicism too it's the soundtrack to the world going to hell in a handbasket and that's great because honestly like it sounds so good I don't really mind I'm going to say I'm feeling a light too decent 9 album and leave it at that thank you for

Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Shamir record ratchet Shamir is a los vegas based singer musician and with this new LP over here he is making his big commercial label debut via excel records i think years ago I might have heard his early early stuff and had a bit of Twitter correspondence with him whatever his older music sounded like I don't really recall it it's just completely slipped my memory but what I do know is that I stumbled upon his call it off single during the YouTube Music Awards that just happened this year and it was like stumbling upon a new artist entirely as I'm sure it was for many people on this track we're talking about a driving four to the floor beat a very bouncy gummy bassline some repeating synth phrases that are kind of squeaking and making glitchy just sort of abrasive noises but it's all very pleasant to the air at least for me that's a strong alternative dance flavor I think that on this track Shamir and his producer Nick Sylvester who he works with across the length of this record do a bit of LCD soundsystem worship on this thing I mean even the refrain about not being able to turn a thought into a wife on this song sounds like something that Nancy Wang would sing off of sound of silver listening to this track and then listening to other singles off of this LP I am floored this record is not coming out on DFA and on excel instead but even though this LP has some blatant LCD soundsystem influences Shamir ultimately has an altogether different personality musically and especially lyrically he is much more influenced by hip-hop he's also influenced by house and that lyricism combines with these danceable beats and then you get the insane body rocking debauchery that you might remember from like Azealia Banks is two-on-two single except maybe a little quirky ER and you get this flavor again on other tracks here like a hot mess as well as make a scene and on the regular other songs on this track listing that I love undeniably this record Nick Sylvester and Shamir have a talent when it comes to hard-hitting dance instrumentals with bubbly playful kind of silly lyrics but this is not a strength they continue to play to on the rest of this record which is a bit of a letdown considering how fantastic I think the singles from this album are this is me on the regular so you know I'm white not that I think these tracks will translate to everybody's Shamir's voice I think is a bit of an acquired taste it's very nasal it's got a strange inflection to it kind of weird but he really plays that inflection up just to add some character character I think it's gonna be a turn-off for some people it was not personally a turn-off for me until Shamir and Nick's start making these attempts that fall very short toward more emotional songs and more balladry like would be very stiff and and kind of passion drained ode to Shamir's hometown on the intro track here or on the track demon where I actually think this record kind of loses its eccentricity and trades it out just for some radio pop blandness with a hook that sounds like twenty one pilots could have written it what made the singles from this LP so attractive those hard-nosed dance beats come back on the track and on the kill but this song among others in the final moments of this record are topped with these incredibly awkward stiff vocal performances that are so redundant it just kind of feels like he's just washing rinsing and repeating as Shamir shifts from the verses to the choruses done and but just not the sharpest and most memorable or our sing-along little vocal melodies either with these lighter more easygoing tracks I feel like I'm listening to Hot Chip but without the pop sensibility when we get to the song youth in the tracklisting here once this track hits though like the the two-minute 15-second mark when Shamir really tries to push himself vocally and I'm done I'm just done but on this track I do like that Shamir tries to say something about the the cluelessness and the follies of youth I find a lot of his lyrics to be kind of funny tongue-in-cheek or he's even making an interesting philosophical statement but on pretty much every single track where he's not going for that bubbly fun demeanor I don't really think his voice because of just constraints with skill and ability don't really carry or convey successfully the emotion that he's shooting for and let's get in closer this one listen the the kind of sour harmonies the strained notes and the very nasal inflection just derails it for me I love the singles off of this LP but this album leaves a lot to be desired vocally and that's it I'm feeling a strong five to late six on this LP transition if you'd give him this tracker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Shamir ratchet forever "},{"id":"k53xc1uVMXM","title":"Eyehategod - Self-Titled ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new self-titled I hate god record this is the comeback album from New Orleans metal outfit I hate God their first studio full-length LP of brand new material in 14 years the band left us on a very gruesome note back in the year 2000 with the LP Confederacy of ruined lives which was a pretty typical record for I hate God heavy noisy abrasive disgusting and I hate God we're not the only metal group in the 90s pumping out these heavy sludgy aggressive riffs there was neurosis of course there was down in crowbar of which I hate God member Jimmy Bower also plays in there's also The Melvins but I hate God was easily one of the most stomach-churning of these groups their music just had a reputation for being more savage more grating heavy distorted guitars primal drums that had a nice punch to him really gross Friday vocals from longtime frontman Mike Williams and then there was the occasional bluesy guitar riff working it into the bands very sludgy brand of mayhem as well and even though the Blues most likely was a musical influence on I hate God directly considering that they were from New Orleans a lot of the blues elements that turn up in the band's music for the most part comes off a lot of the time like Black Sabbath Tony Iommi worship speaking strictly in sludge metal terms I hate God was pretty much on the polar opposite of the finesse scale from a band like Isis back when they were releasing a steady stream of LPS I hate God didn't have much to offer the world in terms of evolution and experimentation but they had the punch you in your face a tude of five bands in their genre so now I hate God is back with this new self-titled record and after 14 years and I'm sure it definitely helped that a lot of the members of the band were still active in other groups but after 14 years their sound is feeling pretty unchanged they are working with a noticeably clearer production sound on this LP but for the most part the guitar tone the drums it feels like all their instrumentation was locked in a room their amps stored away untouched in some studio somewhere and then they just returned to play and it's just all the same because it wasn't touched like I said earlier there are some slight but noticeable changes though I think the vocals are a bit nastier I think the guitar riffs are a little stiffer and the clarity of the recording on this LP maybe puts the band that a level of sonic cleanliness that they didn't really need in a way I think it kind of subtracts from the impact of a band whose style is all impact because at this point I mean you know honestly I hate God is not writing some of the most original riffs in sludge especially in an age when we have people experimenting with the genre so boldly with noise such as bands like Indian and stone Titan and Lord mantis of course crowbar and down are still active there's also groups with flashy er playing and heavier recordings than this like Mastodon and high on fire however I still think there's room in sludge for keeping the genre keeping new records in the genre close to the roots and just keeping things disgusting keeping things straight forward keeping things visceral and that's exactly what the band does from the opening track on this thing agitation propaganda a song that takes these heavy sludgy guitars and pushes them into a punk tempo not a novel song but hard-hitting at least however I think the band goes straight from ruthless to toothless on the very next song with all these staccato guitar riffs that really have no thrill to them whatsoever it's just so tedious listening to the band hammer through these riffs I think the same thing happens on the track framed to the wall in the second half of that song which is kind of disappointing considering it starts off as one of the fastest and most explosive songs on the entire record but there are songs on this record that I think are legitimately crushing toward the back end of this LP where I think more than ever on the rest of this album I hate God is truly sounding like their old selves especially with the second-to-last track here which gets incredibly heavy and doomy especially with this wall of blaring guitars on the tail end of the track just so massive but some of my favorite and what I think the most memorable parts of this LP are are when I hate God are kind of at their blues iasts there's the song quitters offensive which to me sounds like Led Zeppelin on cocaine and meth for a decade adding to its rap sheet every year that goes by and in the process you get one of those really disgusting mug shot progressions where okay Physical Graffiti is the first one and this is the last one there's also the song nobody told me which has these beautiful harmonized guitars in the middle of the track which is a really nice change of pace from the the relentless sludge throughout the rest of the album and there's the track worthless rescue to where I hate God actually pulls out I think some of the sweetest guitar leads on the entire album I hate God's incorporation of leads and melodies like this it's it's good but I do have my slight reservations about it because I think they tend to approach them with so much aggression that they suck the soul out of them a little bit like they really took these melodies and they just seared them on a hot coal grill for 24 hours till they were just like burnt to a crisp I think it's really admirable that I hate God was able to come back with a sound that is so true to their past shovel records I mean it's it's very clear that I hate God cares about their sound but maybe at this point in their return the the joints are not completely fluid and moving yet because despite the volume of this LP they're just so many spots where I think that the animalistic nature of the band doesn't really translate into the listening experience because there are quite a few riffs on this record that either grow stale over time as they are repeated through these tracks or just aren't even interesting to begin with I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you've given Recker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh I hate God forever "},{"id":"osgQqOgJGtw","title":"Red Hot Chili Peppers - The Getaway ALBUM

Orion Joe here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Red Hot Chili Peppers record the getaway this is the latest LP from internationally famous alternative rock and funk rock outfit the Red Hot Chili Peppers the chillies output so far this decade has been kind of lackluster the only other album they put out this decade was 2011 I'm with you which was easily the band's most middling inconsequential smooth and easygoing album yet and that's not really what in my opinion made the band great I mean sure they have some very awesome ballots in their discography songs like under the bridge or scar tissue but it's they're fierce funky and fun rock style that made them such an iconic 90s group now thankfully the getaway brings that funky fierceness back but somehow a lot of the time it still kind of misses the mark unfortunately there are still these really slick and sonically sterile cuts in the mix namely songs like the title track which also kicked the album off for some reason the song the longest wave also makes sure the album is off to a very slow start with one of the most redundant drum beats and lead vocal melodies of the entire album every single time it comes around on the verse I get sick of it so quickly Dadda Dadda Dadda and anthony kiedis of course still comes through with that really put down staccato vocal delivery you know that's just his his singing style you know it's tried and true at this point but I wonder if he's explored every nook and cranny of it especially since on this album I have several moments of deja vu as he kind of delivers his vocals in the same rhythmic pattern it's either this pattern or a variant of this pattern and that would be Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada which is also kind of the same rhythmic pattern his vocals we're riding on the song can't stop which the lead guitar line on this track sounds almost like the bass line from the lead single from this album dark necessities which is a song that I like by the way definitely a highlight in the track listing here I just can't help but feel like everything I like about this record is something that the peppers have done before so there is a lack of new ideas and there are also moments that just feel a little too mellow and maybe that has something to do with the Danger Mouse production on this thing there are a few other artists who he's worked with in the past namely the Black Keys and the result was a somewhat gutless record still though I get a sense that the band is going down a more mellow road like they were on their last record but they're finding more of a balance with their funk rock roots on songs like dark necessities where you have usually smooth beautiful melodic passages balanced out with the slap bass and the hard-hitting drums the song we turn red is similarly melodic funky and dynamic and on the song goodbye angels I love the way that the band plays up to this really tense melodic explosion of instrumentation with these really relentless that the bass lines rhythm guitar and drums it's a little cluttered but the band gets their point across things go slightly south on the song go robot where the band tries to make a pointless point about modern day love and sex against this disco beat that's just a little too easygoing there's a kind of awkward sudden fade-out ending at the very finish of the track which is kind of masked over by these a little blooby blooby synthesizers that I think are supposed to symbolize the digital sex age that the song is supposed to be about oh and then my least favorite track on this thing this Ticonderoga rolls into town where I just cannot stand the brittle distorted sunburned on guitar riffs on this track which sound absolutely hideous and glide awkwardly into and out of the slower more melodic passages of the track it's like the band just wants to bust into this riff but have no idea how to build up to it and they just think kind of this very sudden transition is a good way to assemble the track when in fact it just sounds just cobbled together still I do like the song Detroit even though Anthony Kiedis is vocal inflections here do get to me a little bit I like how the song is essentially a really heartfelt tribute to the Motor City with references to not only Henry Ford but also the Stooges and J Dilla and the song the hunter unquestionably wins the award for the dreariest most depressing and most personal song on the entire record with references to Anthony Kiedis as father as well as Fame and even though I'm kind of indifferent toward the song the choral group vocals on the closing track on this record somehow go over really well and those are essentially my feelings on the album I think they're decent moments to this record there are certainly some high points but they're plenty of low points to that balance it out either they are incredibly forgettable tracks their songs that are awkwardly assembled their songs that are utterly toothless and there are some pretty notable moments of deja vu and the track listing here where it really feels like the Chili Peppers I don't usually say this kind of thing but it literally feels like they're ripping themselves off I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this record I was hoping to like it a little bit more especially since there are songs on this album that are legitimately good it's just that despite the I guess the improvements the Chili Peppers make to their music on this record the album is kind of inconsistent whereas their previous record it was consistent but it was consistently forgettable I'm going to leave it at that thank you for watching transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would your a

of the new against all logic album 2012 to 2017 this is the debut this is the new album from the once mysterious music project on the other people label a music label run by none other than electronic music producer Nicolas jar one of my favorite electronic music producers spaces only noises one of the best electronic records of the decade I don't care what anyone thanks so I take notice when something gets posted on to the other people YouTube channel because not a lot of stuff goes up there I mean the last material Nicolas jar put on the the channel was like leftover stuff from his last album cycle and I also enjoyed some of the artists he was putting on when he originally was running the clown and sunset label a little while back so when I went in to sample these tracks from this artist I assumed was brand new the production style sounded a lot like Nicolas jars although I didn't necessarily assume anything because there were at least a few producers on clown and sunset that sounded a lot like him the production on this thing was very cool very funky very deep a pretty subtle approach to the house music genre and I guess the cat couldn't really stay in the bag because now pretty much everybody and their mom knows that against all logic is in fact Nicolas jar I guess with the age or some of the material on this thing some of it had been circulating around for a while ultimately it doesn't really matter to me under what umbrella the music on this thing is released I think the music itself is fantastic and I'm really happy to hear Nicolas jar kind of making his return to house music because he just sounds better than ever doing it seriously though I think this album is incredibly cutting edge and blows completely out of the water much of what Nicolas has done up until this point because I think Nicolas is production on this project is funkier it's more melodic it's more cerebral he gets more ambitious with samples on this thing to lacing numerous pieces of soul music into these tracks whether it be horn hits or vocal leads like on the track I never dream which features all these cascading vocal samples that kind of bleed into each other in a really psychedelic way also transitioning into some really blissful synths and bustling beats nearly every track on here features these nocturnal groovy rhythm sections that can't be denied also on every track here very round full baselines some of which really just like kind of overtake the lower frequencies of these tracks they're just monstrous or pieces of bass and some pretty cutting-edge sound play too right from the start of the project where it sounds like Nicholas is working with these like distorted samples and he kind of fusses them out to to to a very uh I guess abrasive effect there are so many unique musical moments on this project that make individual songs stand out the song some kind of game features these soulful passionately vocal samples as well as like these hypnotic mashing piano chords the song hopeless has these eerie and impossibly dark synth leads the track is beautiful at subnautica there are these weird noises shots of percussion working into this very intricate beat that gives the song weird sense of place like it's being recorded in like a I suppose like a factory floor or like a loft and attic the bouncy remixed funk of the song nowyou has not only just funk vibes but disco vibes too I can't not move to it even though the track does oh I think a lot of its appeal it's very glitzy appeal to its core sample I think Nicholas does a great job of building musical passages around the sample to me that's where a lot of the magic of this project happens in Nicholas's ability to sort of string entire tracks off of a single sample or a single idea case in point the song City fade which features these tense house piano chords which really could have been plugged into many a house song but I feel like Nicholas breaks the formula up with a pretty intense and complex beat and these ghostly haunting choral vocal samples when we move past this introductory passage Nicholas takes these synthesizers and the drums of the track and strings them into a passage that's pretty jammy almost at the point where it feels like I'm listening to a group of musicians playing together as opposed to more so one man assembling all of it in a computer and Nicholas does get pretty inventive with how he revises or applies samples in this record like on the song now you got me hooked which samples very generously from the dramatic song you got me loving you and Nicholas just finds a whole nother groover this sample just building his own pieces of bass and percussion into the sample because when I first heard it was kind of difficult to tell where Nicholas's input started and the sample ended he's just that good at picking a sound palette where everything kind of just feels very one oh I just love this man's approach to sound I love his approach to sound he just treats sound so nice he treats it so nice another thing I have to compliment pretty much every single track on this record with is the amazing progressions Nicholas works into these tracks rarely is a moment or rarely is a song on this album tedious redundant not heading anywhere the progressions on these songs are fluid they're cinematic they're engaging they have a fantastic balance of tension and release jar takes these songs into really creative and unexpected places while simultaneously just building all of them out very logically this is a fantastic electronic music album I cannot say enough nice things about it it is records like this that remind me that hey it's really fun and its really great being a music reviewer because if I was not constantly trying to find what is the newest latest most interesting thing an album like this could certainly just float under my radar totally unnoticed but now that I'm doing what I'm doing I don't miss records like this thank the Lord because this is just it's an excellent record groovy record very fun record very engaging very fulfilling and even though it does have its slightly mild spots the songs such a bad way is certainly one of those and on the whole the project is pretty much just like a mixed bag of tracks a little bit of a compilation the overall vibe of these tracks really just enhance each other in the album listening experience because they're all so entrancing they're also transcendental and kind of eargasm ik - I'm feeling a decent too strong 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen I hope you have because it really is that good of an album anthony Fantan oh here Nicholas jar against all logic video here next to my head give it a shot also link

white guilt tacking right there okay never mind that now just not review it at all no Beyonce reviews fuck it any what'd you get a review the Beyonce album what do you had it touch mmm damn it I'm gonna end you I swear hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Beyonce album lemonade global pop singing sensation Beyonce with her sixth full-length album she really needs no introduction at this point she is back with another record that is being released sort of out of the blue a lot like her last album which was self-titled which was just like released onto iTunes overnight and didn't really have her need any promotion as everybody was pretty surprised and talking about it like crazy the very next day she complimented track after track after track from this record with a series of music videos and stylistically I thought this was her riskiest album to date even though there were some safe spots and I think risky for Beyonce I see her on this album is kind of dipping her toes into some new sounds some new ideas and on this latest record of hers lemonade I think she's not just dipping her toes I think she's diving right in she's taking even more chances which I assumed was going to be the case from her latest single formation which I thought was great which had a colorful trap flavored banger beat a twang II just plucked lead melody and even though it was just a very snappy a very punchy very catchy single I saw the lyrics as being more personal than what beyonce usually delivers her typical verses about love and relationships and femininity and empowerment on formation we got a little bit of that as well but also references to Beyonce's heritage and her culture and her Southern roots her parents delivered with this monstrous swagger and charisma that I couldn't help but get sucked into I had a hunch I didn't want to assume but I had a hunch that the rest of this record would follow a similarly personal pattern and in fact it does but so personal that I think lemonade is confessional I just didn't know how many personal details Beyonce would be divulging on this record it's to the point where I'm kind of worried about whether or not we're going to see some divorce papers between her and jay-z surface in the next year which is something I read people online talking about but it's it's something that before listening to the record I partially assumed was mostly because people were reading into some esoteric lyrics a little too much or just making some very bold assumptions but but no Beyonce makes her emotions her personal struggles and her intentions painfully clear on so many of these tracks going as far as to hint at the infidelities of her husband and say that she regrets putting this wedding ring on her finger and on other tracks here she makes reference to her parents her father specifically freedom a little bit of politics as well and sonically this is a very risky record for Beyonce - the last album had some subtle hints of alternative R&B and Beyonce's experimentation didn't really go too much farther beyond that now I think she's overtly referencing that sound with appearances from artists like the weakened and James Blake there's even a cut on here that seems semi inspired by fka twigs and there's even a country instrumental a Hard Rock instrumental she makes bold references to funk and soul there are numerous producers on this thing including familiar faces such as boots as well as Diplo they're soft and subtle spacious synthetic beats as well as luscious string sections the track listing is diverse it's occasionally epic its catchy and sometimes heartbreaking the album starts out very somber and quiet with the opening track and the story of this record is as plain as day from the first few lines we have an image of dishonesty being on his breath there's a lack of trust here she's kind of questioning this relationship that she's in she knows something's going on but nothing is quite confirmed beyonce is feeling out of the loop she's feeling confused and there are beautiful pianos on this track that I love a lot that I wasn't surprised to hear that James Blake might have had his hand in writing I saw he was in the writing credits on this track and just the instrumental read to me so much like something James Blake would have put together especially like off his first record and the picture beyonce is painting on this track goes very much with the subtlety of the music because I just get this image in my head of her listening into what's going on on the other side of a door or a wall or something she's just having this very quiet introspective moment wondering what's going on in this relationship that she's a part of the song hold up is a little louder it's a little bolder you can hear the intensity of the album kind of ramping up it's not going hard it's not going crazy it's not aggressive but beyonce has sort of up to the volume of her voice the music is a little more lively her lyrics to me are kind of a mix of anger and pleading for sanity here it's like she's trying to convince her significant other that who else loves you like I love you who else cares about you in the way that I care about you a lot of people have talked about how the chorus on this track directly references the ya-ya song maps and the chorus here does seem like a subtle play on that I get that so Beyonce takes this confusion and uh the the pressure builds into a full-fledged explosion on the very next track the song don't hurt yourself Beyonce is totally fed the fuck up on this track she's volcanic there's a pretty edgy instrumentation on this track to some very crisp drums and weird keyboards that to me sounded like something that could have come off of a battles record but once I heard the blaring guitars and Jack White's voice on the chorus it all kind of made sense Jack White had a hand in the production of this song AHA and the lyrics here in Beyonce's vocal delivery are insane this level of aggression that I never heard her lay on to a record and she even goes as far as to say on this track that she might just you know leave this relationship and bounce over to the next dick though there are some lyrics here that did make me roll my eyes a little bit like motivate you call me Malcolm X the song does have its other shortcomings I do wish that the distortion on Beyonce's voice wasn't really there it thins her voice out in a way that I don't quite care for and I don't really like Jack White that much on this chorus I mean I think the instrumental is cool it is a big change of pace for Beyonce and this album but I think throwing Jack White's vocals into the mix is just doing a little too much and also it it would just make more sense for Beyonce to sing the words on this chorus given what the song is about and who the song is about for Jack white to kind of come in and say when you hurt me you hurt yourself etc it just seems kind of like a bit of a disconnect still though I do think Beyonce's singing on this track is monstrous and I like the sentiment of the song a lot in a smart way it poses the idea that when you're in a relationship anything that happens the other person also happens to you also affect see any of you continuing the flow of the album because again this is very much a story this is very much a progression in a way it reminds me of the relationship tale that Bjork was telling on volnek Keira the song sorry we have Beyonce after this explosive moment with no regrets in her mind the relationship is like over she's not second-guessing herself the instrumental is a little synthetic bleepity bleep ii it's very sweet but i do wish it changed up a little more from the verse to the chorus but in a way it works because the instrumental doesn't really take away from what beyonce is saying and singing on this track as she delivers more very biting and telling lyrics she's calling out excuses she's taken the baby she's gonna start a new life she even makes reference to this mistress woman calling her Becky with the good hair who the Internet is so of hunting for for the blood of right now boo but also referring her specifically as Becky with the good hair could have a lot to do with you know some stuff I'm not really going to get into because people fucking get up my ass about it all of a sudden the flow and the story the direction of this album changes we have the song six inch which is sort of like a working women's empowerment anthem with a banger beat Beyonce sort of monotone on the chorus some subtle auto-tune on her voice just to add a bit of an effect it's a little much especially with the weekend being thrown into the mix too but the track is catchy as hell and it's got I guess kind of a smart life lesson underneath the very gaudy beat the very kind of Club flavor of the song it's not about heed mystically blowing all of your money away on just short-term pleasures but stacking your paper up for a better life tomorrow I don't quite get why Beyonce had to kind of take the stripper angle with the track but Beyonce has always been someone who celebrates sexuality the power of a sexual woman but yet she's kind of working herself to the bone to the point where she's crying at night when she's away from the stage and away from the club Beyonce doesn't get so bogged down in the details of this life that your average person can't relate to this because you know selling yourself for 40 or more hours a week just for a paycheck and that can be kind of degrading - we have the song daddy lessons which is the most endearing track on the entire record beautiful tribute to Beyonce's father over some organic percussion some acoustic guitar the track has a country flavor to it and I do appreciate how dynamic and diverse the tracklist is and how well these songs are kind of flowing into one another as far as the narrative and I guess Beyonce's voice does a good job of kind of tying all of these songs together even though they are in a load of different styles however this particular track it is one of my least favorite instrumentals because I do think it could have done without all the hooting and the hollering throughout the track which to me read like they were making a character of country music there are a few moments where the lyrics are painfully basic like daddy made me fight it wasn't always right although in a way this does remind me of a return back to the lyrical styles of a lot of older soul singers and I get that sense in the the style of storytelling on this song Beyonce referring to her dad simply as daddy and going through a series of life lessons in every lyric that he passed on to her and even when there is a lyrical shortcoming on a track such as this I still get a great sense of emotion coming from Beyonce on this song and others too because what's going on here on this track is so personal that I can tell it just has an immense amount of personal significance for Beyonce and as a result we get great vocal performances and I do have to admit the the refrain about sort of shooting at the site of any of these dangers that her father warns her about is pretty catchy also there's a very telling moment in the chorus here where Beyonce's father tells her that she should also shoot if she sees another man like him approaching I mean Beyonce is dad his inclusion in this record though she does love him and she has a lot of admiration for him he had his own infidelity issues as well so he works in the theme of this record we go back to Beyonce's relationship crumbling immediately after this cut we have the song love drought which is the track that to me sounded a little bit like fka twigs the beat was very synthetic very Spacey Beyonce's vocal delivery here hushed but still plenty of emotion there and she's singing about this loved route that she's in the midst of with her husband could be ended but there's a disconnect there like neither of them are willing to make the effort at the same time to kind of reconnect and make things work again and then from there we move into probably the most depressing and heartbreaking track on the entire record which is just simply a very bare piano ballad but also features one of the best vocal performances on this thing sandcastles and it's painful man this track is painful as hell to me it was kind of like you know when Adele would do a really great piano track but maybe even a little bit beyond that because again the picture she paints here is just so vivid and it hurts just hear her kind of refer to this relationship that she's been building over years and years and years as simply just a sand castle that was eventually meant to crumble and say that every promise wasn't meant to work out that way or the way that you want it to still you know a lyrical flub here and there like Tisha's smashed on the counter from our last encounter but still a stand out moment on the record uh Whitney Houston fans I think we'll get a lot out of this track two and then we go into this short interlude titled from the Shimura which features vocals from James Blake he returns there are some more beautiful piano embellishments and some strange electronic edits and even though the track is so short it's just a little bit of an epilogue to this song it adds so much to the record in transitions into the next track nicely which is the song freedom now this track a lot of people would say and they'd be right that this is the most political cut on the record Beyonce's making a huge statement here especially on the music video that is paired with this song if you watch like the visual lemonade HBO special but I think Beyonce's approach lyrically on this track is a little general and I think that's with a purpose I mean if you take the lyrics in a very general sense you could certainly pose this track within the relationship that she's been singing about for the entire album too but she kind of kills two birds with one stone and I'm not saying that she's not trying to make a political statement here that it could have been better I'm saying she did a smart thing here by being able to make a political statement but also make this track work within the story within the context of this record it's like she wants to be freed from this prison the suffering this unhappy relationship but simultaneously this song again it's also a statement she's making in reaction to all these stories of police brutality to minorities over the past several years the track has a strong funk soul hard like edge to it the instrumentation is vibrant it's dense it's lively its blaring and of course there's got to be a Kendrick Lamar feature on here if you're gonna make a political track and Kendricks verse is great I love how in the first few lines didn't know if you noticed this but he sort of does a bit of a countdown thing and Beyonce I think she just puts together a great track that is this heartfelt as the other songs I mean Beyonce not usually the one to make political statements in her music or make a country song but you know whatever make political statements in her music and this comes across is so heartfelt she portrays freedom as something that isn't simply just given to you it's something that you earn it's something that you need to maintain it's sort of motivational in a sense - as we have a refrain here saying that I'm going to keep running because winners don't quit on themselves and after this big showing of instrumentation and in a grand statement we're given a kind of low-key cut called all night which is sort of like The Closer of the album or at least the closing of this story in a way and Beyonce comes to the conclusion that this relationship is still worth working for and it's still worth being in but she needs to get to a point where she can kind of trust her significant other again and I love the base on this track - I'm really happy not only for this track but any point on this record where some great organic instrumentation turns up and even though there are lyrics on this track there may be a little blatantly sexual or basic for some people I see Beyonce as just a very sexual artist and someone whose love is a very physical love and that's why when she sings lyric like I'm going to row because of a Dutch opinion there's still so much conviction there it's not like she's just saying it for the sake of titillation like there is a point to that those types of expressions really mean something to her so this track to me is kind of the finish is the conclusion of this tale of this moment of infidelity this moment of kind of questioning the future of your relationship and meanwhile formation is kind of like this big banger that plays as the credits of the story role and even the song makes sense within the narrative the entire record because there's a point where she says she's possessive so she wears his chain so I guess at this point things are kind of fine and smoothed over but still you know for me personally being kind of subject to all of these very intimate details of a very public relationship was semi traumatizing so to be to be in the relationship I imagined could you know be even harder or it's just all sort of thrown in there for jihadist and I'm not sure you know it was entertaining I liked the story I liked the concept I thought the theme was cool but simultaneously I can't help but feel like the music industry occasionally is like I don't know some Truman Show esque thing where everything that's released to us is just meant to manipulate us in some way and if everything Beyonce is saying is true on this album and the result is this great record you can truly say that she was given lemons but she made lemonade I'm feeling a strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen you better have and I hope you enjoyed it I like it a lot I think it's great definitely my favorite Beyonce record a really mature album really well fleshed out concept thoughtful focused on point good production really it's it's a very nice record I'm I'm already saying it so a nice things about it let's get the fuck out of here Beyonce lemonade forever "},{"id":"AZD9mJ_yGIQ","title":"David Bowie - ‚òÖ (Blackstar) ALBUM REVIEW [R.I.P. BOWIE]","y":9,"x":"hi everyone blaka knees start on oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new David Bowie record black star the thin white duke David Bowie legendary singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist entertainment icon and up until very recently um alive and I know that that last part of my description might sound kind of callous however it does play Bowie's death very much into the theme and the lyrics of this record in such a way I don't think this piece of context could be ignored it's essential to the narrative of this record this record over here is the follow-up to Bowie's last album 2013's the next day an album that ended a ten-year studio album silence for Bowie as he came back with a sound that emulated his older work but with a heightened sense of self-awareness maybe to the point where it was a little tongue-in-cheek and on his latest project over here Bowie seems just as aware and conscious of his musical past and relevancy but not in a way where it feels like he's trying to redo anything blatantly more in that he's trying to plow forward into some real experimental and left-field territory that is definitely going to challenge listeners and hardcore fans now this record is a very different project for Bowie mostly because I think he was in a very different place as he was recording and writing it and that place is the threshold of death a lot of artists no matter what the medium explore the concept of death it's a pretty universal theme a theme that audiences are interested in as well since it's going to be a part of their experience in life too or has been via the deaths of people around them but I can't think of another instance where it's been so clear that artist was exploring this theme face to face literally like head-on because now we know with David Bowie's passing he had a pretty intense battle with cancer going for the past 18 months it's almost like his job was done here and now that his swan song had been released it was time for him to move beyond and it's like the lyrics and the music videos attached to these songs turned Bowie's oncoming death into an art project and I don't mean in such a way where it cheapens his death as a listener you can kind of in a strange way touch death vicariously through the music of this record tracks like Lazarus and Blackstar and I can't give everything away alone these three tracks alone throw a heap of morbid and occult imagery into the lap of the listener but moving away from the context a bit and talking about what's going on with this record musically speaking before the release of this record Bowie had cited Death Grips and Kendrick Lamar as influences for his music on this record and I think those influences do show up when listening to this thing but in a very subtle way in the instrumentals Bowie similarly creates a very lively organic human feel out of what sounds like guitars drums bass packed into very digital boundaries and within these boundaries Bowie creates beauty but also very intense cacophony to just look at the song Blackstar which though it is very clearly a rock track at its core there are a lot of synthetic elements to it the weird vocal manipulations on Bowie's voice that reminds me quite a bit of Fever Ray the weird blur decent stabs that appear here and there throughout the track the bass instrumentation a lot of the time feels kind of simple but it's heightened by some great string arrangements and an horns too which appear throughout this record the first half of this track is very unsettling it's eerie it's challenging more impatient music listeners might be kind of waiting for when the track is actually going to get started but the second half bowie kind of transitions into something more within his wheelhouse something with more of a glam style swagger to it but still remains the weird unsettling characteristics that were there on the first half of the track it's a really great two-part song that weaves together all these really intricate flavors and lyrical themes very well and if there's another thing that strikes me in terms of the differences between this latest record and Bowie's last record is that he seems to be embracing the weariness of his voice on here in a very big way like with the crack yelped vocals on girl loves me or on the song tis a pity issue was a hoe where we have these shaky singing vocals on the verses and these very intense manic shouts in the second half of the track as the instrumentation intensifies the bass and the drums go way harder and that's topped with these noisy horns wailing away in the left and right channel all and the lyrics take kind of a vulgar turn which seemed similar to me in tone to what Lou Reed was doing on that Metallica collaboration Lulu and before you groan at that comparison Bowie actually was noted to have enjoyed that record and it kind of reminds me of Scott Walker's latest output - with how freakish and and vulgar the lyrics get especially on the song sue where Bowie's singing turns similarly ghoulish over a little gnarly bass and guitar riff and drum beat that sounds like it could have come off of swans - be kind sue really sounds like a fusion of bish Bosch and to be kind but I mean that in the best way possible and James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem actually has drum credits on this track and the song girl loves me - it's easy to see that Bowie was going for something really visceral and propulsive when it came to the bass and the drums on this LP given the personnel and Bowie himself is no stranger to viscera and linear grooves and repetition just look at a lot of his art rock records from the past like station-to-station and heroes and lo so in a way on this record Bowie is kind of returning to his roots but in the most freakish way possible Bowie's glam tendencies do show up on this record though but more on the ballads of the LP like on Lazarus and dollar days and the closing track and these songs make for a very beautiful contrast to the harder and more aggressive cuts on the LP the music on this thing is great for the most part if there's any complaints that I have it's that sometimes the instrumentation is a little too sanitary clean kind of feels like in the digital space where it exists it doesn't kind of bleed together in the way that live instrumentation would so I think there's a bit of an organic feel that's kind of lost on some of the more aggressive tracks and also the Weeping harmonica and very sugary synthesizers on the closing track here do feel sort of dated but it's it's really the lyrics on this record where this project kind of comes to life for me or comes to death and turns super surreal like on Black Star which when I first heard it I thought it was some kind of a cult analyzation of Bowie's popularity fame relevancy but now given his passing and all of the other themes of death that run throughout all these other songs which are way more obvious in the context of the rest of the record it seems like Bowie is talking about being a black star in the sense that he is no longer a star that is light or has light the star is blackened it's gone dark and light being life itself I think and another thing that kind of struck me when I thought about the music video is that there are moments where an astronaut suit broken with a skeleton side is kind of portrayed I'm thinking that's got to be Major Tom and given the song it's it's like the mission that Major Tom was going on it was like a suicide mission or he was just going into the great unknown sort of like how Bowie is on this record over here which is really intense to think about um you know I I don't think Bowie would have self referenced so blatantly if weren't for a purpose and now that purpose seems super clear then there's the song Lazarus which if you know the story of Lazarus he died and came back to life via a miracle four days later and now we have Bowie on the song singing in a way where the lyrics are literally like a transmission from beyond the grave and he's making observations about how he's up in heaven and now everybody sort of knows him which sure given his iconic status isn't really that bold of a prediction that people would be talking about him his death but still it's like too real to hear him singing about it and in the greatest lyrical coincidence on the entire record with the track girl loves me we have Bowie's singing where the did Monday go and with his announcement of his death from this past weekend it's like he didn't even make it to the Monday when I'm recording this review but deeper into the lyrics it's like I'm listening to the deterioration of Bowie's mental and physical being on this track as it seems like he is unfamiliar and scared or freaked out or confused by his surroundings or what he sees he's losing time he's losing his sensibilities his sanity and the song dollar days similarly feels like a descent into death as well especially as Bowie is quite literally singing on this track I'm dying too and the closer really does sound like a final goodbye surely without a doubt it's just really crazy to think of and there are moments in the lyrics here where I feel like I'm listening to Bowie reach that point where he can't give any more can't do any more he's been fully drained or maybe this song in a way is about parting with his earthly possessions earthly relevance and fame because he can't take it with him this is a really strange music listening experience and a deeply moving one as well I was getting choked up listening to the record and thinking back to that Major Tom reference in the music video and just the fact that I mean it literally Bowie is facing death on this record and quite bravely exploring it and it seemed like he made his life all about music and now in his final moments he decided that you know he wanted to spend his last bit of life sort of doing exactly what his life was about and reflecting on where his life was about to go this is a great record you know and I think it's a really interesting that Bowie provided a series of songs that it's it's really no BS I mean there's not really a low point on this album it's almost an hour long and it seems like every moment is just as essential to the next it all plays into this very jaw-dropping odd inspiring look at the end of the life of the artist who's actually creating the music here it's a very surreal experience and the music would have been great even if Bowie lived on for five more years because it explores these themes so incredibly well and does it with some interesting instrumentation great sax solos cool vocal performances that that play to the strengths of Bowie's voice at this point in his life the passion the emotion the weariness I'm feeling a light a decent 9:00 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it did it shake you deep down below emotionally did you feel like you were right there with Bowie at the end of his life on this LP let me know you're the

emo tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new you know the new self-titled American football album this is the second full-length album from emo legends American football a band whose lone album which was released back in 1999 shaped up to be one of the most influential for the genre American football has never been one of the most famous emo bands out there they never quite hit the mainstream like groups such as save the day or Jimmy Eat World did but they did make some incredible music in the short amount of time that they were around which is why I was looking forward to this album I had actually caught them live after they reunited not too long after and the show was pretty good too so no reason to worry I say that but I'm also a big proponent of the idea that you either use it or you lose it and not to say that American football has been entirely inactive in between these two records Mike Kinsella frontman Mike sella has released his share of solo albums in the interim but rebooting a band that had its creative peek back in 1999 is a lot like rebooting a computer that was the top of the line back in 1999 it's going to be slow going and could use some serious updating as well hence why comeback records can be so hit or miss and I think this new record over here lands on the Miss side of that fence while I do like American footballs debut this album in my eyes anyway proves that it was kind of a flash in the pan because American football have returned on this record only to sound like some no named easy listening soft rock band with twinkly guitars and forgettable songs and sure American football they never really had an aggressive streak in their music but their hypnotic and beautiful songs were always punctuated with some strong percussion we're usually pretty tight and nimble and detail-oriented like the band could certainly go aggressive that they wanted to and occasionally they would give you a taste of that power but they would always play a reserved and subtle which helped the song shine really brightly and still the band's recording and their performances came off very raw and intimate but lb2 unfortunately is just a shell of its predecessor it has elements of the debut which is to be expected I mean the they were there when they were recording it so of course there are some aspects of it they're able to recreate here pretty nicely but things are off just enough to where really derails the album and I'm not looking for American football to just literally repeat their debut record despite the fact that this is another self-titled album and I imagine the photo here features the house featured in the first album's cover it's just that the vibe is super different and that might have something to do with Mike having evolved as a songwriter for years outside of the context of American football and now trying to come back to the band and write songs in the same style but also kind of not what I do know is that the serene guitars and the easygoing grooves and the very clean recording come together into this noxious mix that sounds like a Coldplay album more than it as an American football album and that clear potent feeling of sadness from the last record has been replaced with just complacency there's very little on this record that feels worth getting emotionally invested in when the band picks up the pace a little bit the album is somewhat entertaining like on the track desire gets in the way which has some of the sharpest guitar leads on the entire record and the song I need a drink has this enjoyably woozy kind of groove to it that sort of trips over itself every few bars or so and the way the track builds into these tents but gentle rhythm guitars in the second half is pretty nice too it was a stroke of genius that reminded me of some of the great songwriting ideas from the band's first record you know it's not a complete and total fall from grace it seems like the band does their best to try to rekindle that flame and I think some fans are going to see this album as an acceptable as an admirable return but let's not pretend that the band came back better than ever this thing fell so short of expectations and so much so to the point where I'm not holding my breath for another record if there even is one I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one Tran have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should interview next hit the like if you like please subscribe and

"},{"id":"S8BpvVYuqgk","title":"Noname - Telefone MIXTAPE REVIEW","y":8,"x":"ah hi everyone know that he named Shanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new no-name mixtape Ted a bone did it did a PO no-name who I've also seen credited as no-name gypsy in the past is a Chicago rapper who made some waves in 2013 with an appearance on chance the rapper's hit mixtape acid rap now given that that was chances big breakout tape it didn't give no-name a whole lot of room to steal the show but as the years went on she started to make more appearances on more chance the rapper projects also appeared on a few albums from fellow Chicago artists like Mick Jenkins as well as Jessi Boykins the third and even though I've heard her around and I've been aware of her as a rapper I have to admit I've never really came away from a no-name verse like damn that was verse there were some bars and in a way maybe that's kind of by design not that I think no-name tries to sound boring but her features lack the overblown put on they usually come out to play once a rapper starts spitting instead of trying to sound better than you or larger-than-life or really angry or super sexy no-name sounds and since it's like a likable relatable human being weird I know and the same vibe comes through on this new mixtape over here except in the concept of an entire project this very subtle soft-spoken delivery that no name has going actually has some impact to it it's kind of like she was that girl at that party who didn't really stand out because she kind of kept to herself and wasn't really trying too hard to get anybody's attention but away from the riffraff and the hustle and bustle and in the setting of this very intimate mixtape it is revealed that she is in fact one of the sweetest and smartest people there now this thing is ten tracks it's about 33 minutes long and the project gets sweeter and warmer with every cut telephone is kind of like a big loving hug and not in a corny way like the music's trying to be really happy and in force you to be in a good mood rather no names really positive attitude throughout this project is so natural and comforting that it's infectious and the music on this thing reflects that - of course it is not surprising that she is rapping over a lot of very smooth jazzy soulful instrumentation not a surprise because she has worked with chance to rapper on numerous occasions and you know that's obviously a sound that he loves to work over but also I can't really see many other instrumental styles complementing her rapping I think it just makes sense for her delivery now the soft sensual sleepy sounds of neo-soul are very popular right now as well and in numerous reviews I have been quick to point out when artists are playing with the genre and they don't sing well they don't play their instruments well they can barely write a song but in the case of telephone the production is consistently gorgeous the percussion is simple but it's effective the keyboards are fantastic the chord progressions mwah mwah mwah the guest vocalists sound great and are usually mixed over one another really well when they're doing some background vocals or something like that doing some multitrack vocals and no-name while she does sing on the projects she never really takes lead and I think it's because she realizes that she's more of a rapper than a singer and this project is better for it instead she does her best and I think succeeds shining through on this project with her very personal and personable lyrics like on the song yesterday where she has a funny little line about wearing tennis shoes to clubs with dress codes because fuck their clubs while the second verse of the song is loaded with nostalgic allusions to life her past her grandmother the song sunny duet has these very pretty sporadic do-do-do vocal harmonies that that pepper the intro of the track which are really ear grabbing and once no-name starts rapping it's really cute and heartwarming because she's kind of just like spitting bars about being in love and - rapping about a crush on the song ditty Bob there are numerous references to her mother in her lyrics specifically moments when she was a kid and was getting in trouble and would be threatened to have her ass being there's just something really sweet and heartwarming and innocent about these tracks even as No Name is rapping about things like the drugs that she's not doing anymore or that her mother is worried about her because she likes alcohol a little bit too much it's her lyrics and it's also her delivery as well which occasionally I think while it is quiet it does get so slow and so lazy that it is a little bit of a turn-off like on the song all I need we're in the second half of the track she just kind of stops rapping for some reason but then the song reality check shows how capable of a rapper she really is as she keeps a pretty steady flow from the beginning to the end of the cut also one handful of bars that stuck out to me 17 moments and cloudy days on my snap mysterious aberration illuminated the trap my telephone Cal occasion synonymous with the sunrise now is against the foreground I thought that was a pretty poetic also the song casket pretty very short track wish it was longer wish it was more explored because it's one of the heavier songs topically but it's a very dark song despite how sweet the instrumentation sounds talking about how her friends are young their casket pretty other sort of at that age where their lives are most threatened by the ongoing violence in Chicago and violent police officers - as she raps in the song about helping her friends make it home hoping her telephone doesn't ring with of course you know bad news the song forever is one of the peppier smooth and and upbeat and catchy tracks in the track listening and then the song bye-bye baby another favorite of mine in the tracklist is very sad I don't know whether or not to be moved to cry or move to just kind of smile because of how thoughtful the song is she's essentially rapping about her baby who she aborted and she is deeply regretting this decision and kind of envisioning in her head being in heaven taking care of the baby or you know atoning for this mistake in some kind of way I've never really heard of this topic quite in this manner and I actually have to say it was pretty unique it was pretty interesting overall I love the project it has its obvious shortcomings I think no name could do a little bit to make her rap style more engaging occasionally with the muddy vocals it does sound like this thing was recorded on a potato plus I would like to hear a couple more focused song topics and verses on the next project all that being said though telephone is unquestionably one of the nicest one of the kindest and one of the warmest mixtapes I've heard this year a project that I think is going to greatly reward sensitive and patient listeners I'm feeling a light eight on this thing transition have you given this no name tape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this tape have a good one thanks for watching bye "},{"id":"ZAKIxgzgNJ8","title":"Swans- The Seer ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd albums this long take a lot out of me and this album is the seer the latest LP from the longtime experimental rock outfit swans I've covered this band before on the channel reviewed their last LP in 2010 which at the time was their first album in over ten years the band broke up in the 90s ended up performing in the in the 2000s and there is a bit more information in that review you can watch it it's linked in the description box of this video now truth be told swans returned to putting out studio records was not as exciting for me as it was for some other people and not because I'm not a fan I am I just felt like swans last effort was a bit of a letdown unfortunately kind of subdued a none adventurous for a record carrying the swans name there were a lot of very dark funky sounds on this record and despite the fact that the band has indulged in sounds like that before on previous records I couldn't help but feel like this album was more like a michael gira solo LP or a record from another one of his side projects Angels of Light which wasn't completely surprising considering that a lot of the members in this current phase of swans career were previously collaborating with jira on that project before he kind of jumped and did the swans thing I really just kind of came away from rope to the sky hoping that the band was just getting warmed up and I feel like the seer confirms that bands definitely kind of getting the ball rolling again on dishing out the sounds that that I would normally associate with this band you know the noisy experimental ought inspiringly weird and challenging music that they're known for because they're really getting back to those longer tracks those drones just that that overall strangeness that was so awesome about the later period of swans career with loads of drones cacophonous instrumentation noise escapes and mind-numbing repetition and of course michael gira is very disturbing lyrics and and abrasive sounds of all shapes and sizes rumbling overpowering over modulated shrill love that word considering the kind of music the band puts out swans fans are really the type of people who beg to be tortured and abused and on this LP swans are happy to oblige the most impressive thing about this LP overall i would say easily is the fact that swans maintain such a high high level of tortured despair for a majority of this two-disc two hour-long very ambitious album which I will start describing right from the beginning I will try to keep my descriptions of tracks and musical moments succinct because I really do feel like I could talk for as long as this album lasts now the opening track on the first disc lunacy just has an amazingly hellish chorus on it it is just bone-chilling and the track actually features members of the band low hell of how these chorus vocals just trade spots with some really heavy abrasive instrumentation it is the perfect opener for this thing it kind of sets the stage for what you're going to get throughout the album some strange vocals a little bit of organ in there I believe some guitar and some hammered dulcimer as well kind of chopping it up in the mix the next track mother of the world has these really sharp repetitive riffs on it guitar riffs that play this very stuttering groove that is very unlike any groove I have heard in any sort of rock inspired song it's very attention grabbing and you can hear Michael Cera's vocal on the track just it's just heavy breathing into the microphone is just weird like I listen to this track and and other tracks on this album and just think what are you doing it's freaking me out man at first I wasn't too impressed with this track thought it was a little too repetitive the groove itself is repetitive but the band works to subtly build atmosphere around this groove more instrumentation just more sounds kind of fly-in swans really do love repetition on this LP I like the subdued outro on this track too that it kind of breaks into after after a really intense build-up is very mournful very funky now the title track in the middle of this first disc is 30 minutes long and it is surprisingly cohesive considering its length however this is not the first long-form song that swans has written like this the only thing that really kind of feels disconnected from the rest of the track is the very noisy drone that introduces the whole thing and they just kind of dies out before the real meat of the track begins and the track features this really slowly building groove before Michael Gira's vocals just kind of get multi-tracked on top of each other and in this very kind of chanting repetitive hypnotic way he's trying saying I see it all I see it all I see it all really strange and the track builds into a very high high noisy just ear-shattering climax and right after that it just kind of breaks into these syncopated hits of drums guitar just basically every instrument the swans can muster all crashing down over and over and over I should also mention that there are some slower moments on this track that also kind of remind me of God speed but I digress back to this crashing instrumentation though this point can seem especially repetitive maybe the most repetitive point on the entire album work and it can really kind of drag on I'm sure for a first-time listener but every time you get a hit you get a crash of instrumentation swans work to kind of make the dissonance qualities of these hits different like subtly different either there are just different tones buried in the crashes or they are just slow getting more and more intense or altered as the Tramp progresses and I really like the dusty soundscape that finishes the track off there's a nice harmonica in there it's it's a really interesting serene calm after the storm the track the seer returns features Jarboe on the track you know coming back into the fold with swans although I found her vocal contribution on the song to be maybe a little too subtle I would have loved to have heard her just more front-and-center this track features one of the more straightforward grooves on the entire LP and it could even be catchy and kind of easy to show people who don't know about swans if it were not for Michael Gira's very freakish vocal delivery and and narrations this group is jammed out with more intense energy as the track continues on it's a song that I wish kind of came to more of an interesting climax to be completely honest I do think it's a little bit underwhelming because it doesn't really have a point be really kind of just a getting loud and then it's you know kind of it the track afterwards though 93 Ave that is totally the kind of mind I go to a swans album to hear there are these wailing strings coming from all directions and man all the gaps between the sounds just keep getting filled more and more and more until things are just oh just unbearably sharp and ugly I love the deadpan chorus vocals on this track as well and man do things get loud and just oh I don't have a word for it it's so goddamn loud toward the end of this track everything just all ones it's like murder it's sonic music murder it is murder on the track on the second disc you get a nice little experimental Fulk opener that features Karen O on vocals it has very tried and true chord progression very dusty it has some very heavenly layers of indescribable instrumentation kind of popping between some of her verses and ending the song off its you know kind of a treat for anybody who has kind of made it through the album's so far like hey hey here here's here's a nicer track for you since you just sat through all that you know the song avatar after that has a nice groove a cool chord progression very nice instrumental progression very s collective not a word whatever maybe it is I just made it up it is a word there's some really cool bells on the track and I would really love it if it were not for the just I'm gonna say it bad lyrics just bad lyrics on this track my eye is in your eye is just like constantly just switching out words it's like a fill-in-the-blank lyrical scheme that is just not interesting at all but still despite that I would say the second disc is so much more solid than the first more cohesive than the first even with the two 20-minute tracks that end it which at this point should I even describe them in detail I mean you know if you've made it this far through the album and you're enjoying yourself you're gonna like these two tracks the first of the two tracks I kind of think of as being a short acoustic ballad that has a fifteen minute long intro the drone that starts this track off is very sound rich I love the just multi-tracked hammered dulcimer that just oh man they just really just rock my brain when they pop in it's it's very overwhelming and the groove that pops in shortly after that and the way it kind of you know coasts downward into something very kind of smooth and friendly and heavenly is is nice and last track on here is just oblivion it is just everything getting destroyed it is just pure filth ugliness just oh man while I wasn't so in love with this LP ifirst I was pleasantly surprised and very happy upon further listening to really get a grip of how frightening how twisted how sick how dark how just freakish strange unsettling disturbing this album is I feel like because of the length of the album and the repetition of some of the songs that is not necessarily going to sink in on a first impression and you know I'm also going to come out and say that some songs on here are for some people going to be unnecessarily long pretentious to experimental just masturbatory but it is because of that masturbatory nature the swans has that they are just able to plunge their hands and just reach deeper and darker then a lot of bands can and that's just all about I have to say about this LP really an album that is too large for words to be completely honest however I don't feel like that means that this album is without its flaws there are some underwhelming moments you know there are some spots that I wish had a bigger climax and there are some spots that I wish had a bit more instrumental variation still despite my small gripes this this is an album nez deserving of of the swans name I'm feeling a light decent 8 on this thing what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana swans the seer forever you "},{"id":"tAXqMlMoyg8","title":"Ab-Soul- Control System ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"my Death Grips tickets hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review absol control system absol is a California rapper this is his second full-length album it's out now on rapper Jay rocks label Top Dawg entertainment and he's also a member of the rap collective black hippy which is kind of just his cohorts on top dawg dawg including j-roc schoolboy q and my favorite Kendrick Lamar now I first caught absol like I'm sure a lot of people did last year on the Kendrick Lamar album section 80 a fantastic conceptual mind-bending hip hop album that you must check out if you have not one of my favorites of last year an absent one of my favorite verses on the entire LP on the track absol doubt row and I thought it was funny that a guest rappers verse pretty much summed up the entire emotional package of section 80 in one single track I had to check the dude out and I found out that his debut full-length album long-term mentality was dropped earlier that year so I took a listen and overall I thought it was decent it wasn't really impressing me to any great extent and I guess my biggest disappointment about this LP and this is just from hearing him first on Kendricks album it didn't feel as deep I guess as what I heard him spitting on on Kendricks album now control system is out absol sophomore album release 17 tracks on this thing and overall more length more energy more variety and more topical songs too as far as rapping goes I feel like absol is coming off way more passion on this LP whether he's telling a heart-wrenching story getting wasted bragging or attacking societal norms he just sounds just upfront Center attention demanding relentless there are just too many sides to his personality on this album to attack in one brief review sometimes he's clever and cocky and blunt blowin and rapping in this upper register vocal delivery that actually reminds me a lot of Danny Brown he actually resembles Danny Brown so closely at some points it's almost impossible to tell the difference between him focally and Danny Brown on the Danny Brown featured track terrorist threats now when AB is kind of on this trip I feel like his personality pretty much boils down to a line from the hook on the second track to this album track to abyssal abstract asshole an abstract asshole it's pretty much a perfect depiction of the personality that he displays on control system but just when absol may seem like he is the most egotistical guy in the world he will spit a line about how poor he is or just say something proving that he doesn't take himself too seriously now the free range tracks on this album are really great absol just brings one unexpected juxtaposition after another but the topical tracks on this thing are pretty great too absol can tell a story or really getting the gist of the meaning behind the track or his personal philosophy the track terrorist threats with Danny Brown is kind of about personal freedom and achieving that through some kind of the Warriors style gang collaboration revolution the track double standards is about exactly that but in relation to gender and kind of having this personal desire to respect women but then realizing that's not exactly the societal norm that we're dealing with here and the book of Sol is is one of my favorite tracks on here comes up toward the end and is about this really long time love interest who had a huge impact on his life but then of course she passes away and not only is this track about the personal story of him and her but just the emotional terror the aftermath that comes with losing that person now the production to me isn't amazing it's for the most part a lot of traps Stiles snare drums and high hats just clinking and clicking away against some really refined samples and then glassy keyboards again it's not something I would rave over if this were an instrumental album or something like that but I do think absol sounds great over these instrumentals the Aries string sections on track 2 are really great I love the muddy jazz sample on the song bohemian groove the very pretty piano melodies on the track double standards are a perfect foundation for that song there are a few surprises kind of like the track terrorist threats which gets especially dark bleak and kind of weird the instrumentals on here go hard when they need to they get very pretty and emotive when they need to but still despite the subtle detail there is something about these instrumentals that feel kind of messy feel kind of rough around the edges something that kind of gives this album a street vendor soul mixtape grittiness to it overall I feel like this album's greatest asset is personality just add souls personality and lyricism - to me there's no extremely strong concept or narrative that brings all the tracks together into a tightly packed punch the intro this album would have you believe that this album is about control systems mind control wanting to live your life the way you want to live it without the influence of laws or societal norms and while those themes are on here I feel like the biggest theme is just the many sides of rapper absol the features on this thing are pretty great for the most part it's it's just the top dawg entertainment crew and friends that appear on this album there's a great black hippy pasa tract on the end of this thing I wish the album had a bit more originality to it you know there are definitely contemporaries of absol that you could easily compare him to that he just has a little bit of in his style like Kendrick Lamar like Danny Brown and there are even some spots on here where he will embark on a swag rap track like little B or ASAP Rocky I wish there were more topical tracks I wish the production was a little bit more adventurous too but still despite all of that I felt that this was a really fun and engaging listen kind of feeling too light too decent eight on this album what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why what should I be reviewing next Anthony Fantan oh absol forever you "},{"id":"-R0ZrESv178","title":"YG - Still Brazy ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"what's your favorite idea - being creative yeah ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new yg album still still breezy yg according to my notes is a California rapper he's now following up his breakout 2014 album my crazy life I liked it I thought it was a decent record but everything I liked about the album didn't seem to directly have anything to do with yg there were great features on this thing I was really impressed with a few of the hooks really like DJ mustards funky Basie synthetic production when I didn't enjoy the album it was really because of all the sketches that padded the record out though I like that the album was trying to be conceptual it was kind of a short LP to be incorporating so many little sketches and yg himself didn't really bring much to the table in terms of flow or memorable lines it's really only the potential of my crazy life that actually had me semi interested in listening to this new album that and I thought the teaser singles were okay tracks like Rio is hey and the song fdt which stands for fuck Donald Trump epidural tracks that are super simple super blunt a little goofy in their directness maybe a little overly simplified but I actually thought these tracks were pretty catchy fun and I could tell that yg was making a serious effort to try to address a bit of an elephant in the room when it comes to music that has social issues weaved into it I mean even you know king kendrick lamar's like dropping anti-donald trump songs a lot of rappers aren't in fact another thing I liked about these two tracks is that they kind of had this throwback flavor to the instrumentals in regards to the production on this thing a no DJ mustard to be seen unfortunately but the production on this thing is incredibly good anyway and pulls from that old-school G funk down which I think is sort of necessary in this era of music where revivalism in hip-hop is so popular I mean this decade so far has brought a myriad of different artists from the East Coast who are bringing back that boom-bap vibe but we haven't seen that same sort of rush of artists from the west coast kind of reliving that g-funk sound I think putting out a record with a sound like this is a smart move on YG's part especially in the wake of movies like straight out of Compton clearly people have nostalgia for this era in rap history and nobody is really feeding it even dr. Dre himself with his new Compton soundtrack he kept it really contemporary here and even though I applaud yg on this sometimes I wonder if he sort of lacks the self-awareness to do a record like this I mean he does have one bar on here where he says he's like the only rapper to make it out of the West without Dre for one not true but also even though dr. Dre isn't coming out directly and co-signing you you are kind of riding on a sound that he helped popularize regardless though yg does bring to the sound lots of memorable hooks topical song subjects some catchy flows some good features longer song lengths because this project certainly feels more meaty and structured than my crazy life he doesn't really go overboard on the skits either a lot of them are pretty short they don't affect the flow of the album the entire project kicks off with the very grimy smooth and eerie don't come to LA I'm way more impressed with YG's delivery on this one I think he's got way more conviction better breath control and he says every word as if he means it prior he would occasionally kind of mumble words together into a series of bars that really weren't all that coherent and whether you could tell what he was saying or not it didn't really demand your attention and I'm just loving that this song not only does a good job of setting the tone for the record but it's also very smooth and mean tribute to the area that he's from a DS feature on this track too is really over-the-top and insane we have the song who shot me which I thought was really cool not only because of the way that yg really brings the narrative out on this track and delves into these themes of betrayal and paranoia I love the line on here where he talks about his grandma's praying for him and it helped him because things could have been worse he's talking pictures on a shirt and the beat kind of reminds me of something that would have been produced by dr. dre on like one of Eminem's first couple of Records and yg even seems to pull from that influence a little bit too as he acts in character of the people who he seems to be rapping about on this album occasionally like on the song Jimmy got shot where he's rapping about all of his friends who now that he's kind of made it in hip-hop are sort of looking for a handout love the song twist my fingers obviously very strong gangsta rap vibes coming through on this track he talked about other rappers putting Compton on the map but he says he's putting bomp tin on the map he's representing Compton not only as someone who lives there but as somebody who is a blood from Compton he talks about other rappers pretending to be Bloods and in a couple bars here says that you know he's going to confront them in the club a bit but what I like about this song the most is not only the very sticky hook but also just the vibe of the instrumental and the song itself it kind of feels like some old-school Snoop Dogg liked the song who am i everything from the very bowels laced into the beat call back again to that 90s Cali G Funk era we have the song boom bomb and black t'v which is kind of a sequel to make it back bambo from his last record obviously being a blood he is not saying some of these c-words because you know that crip rivalry key is kind of taking the same song concept but actually fleshing it out into something that's a little meteor and more memorable it's nice that yg is revisiting these ideas and actually giving them the attention giving the song length and giving the song structure that they deserved all along and again on this track we see yg rapping about how he is bold on and elective he's not really breaking a sweat in the face of pressure not allowing himself to get sucked into unnecessary conflict probably the album's best of unintentional advice but when yg starts giving advice on the record maybe it's in a way that some people are really going to take to it like on the song she wished she was which some people will probably hear and just call the song blatantly sexist but I don't see the song so much as like women need to act this way and men need to act this way to me the track is more of a cautionary tale in a way where yg is warning that women not get into what he paints as a gangsta lifestyle but we have people like Jay 305 on the track unapologetically coming out and drawing gender lines on here talking about why women that sleep with a lot of guys or hoes if themes of sexism trigger you then you might just want to sit this one out we have the song fuck Donald Trump again at first I kind of thought the song was pandering when I heard it as a single but then as I gave it more lessons not only did the track just read to me as fun and catchy and not only in a sense agreeable I mean it's not an incredibly thought-provoking track but I think it puts a statement bluntly that didn't really need to be anything else other than blunt and it felt like the track was fueled by genuine feelings especially as Nipsey Hussle came in and delivered a pretty awesome verse about how it's not the USA without the Mexicans that Donald Trump himself is demonizing in his campaign speeches and it's in these last few moments on the record that yg actually gets consistently political we have the song blacks and browns which deals directly in relations between blacks and California and Latinos in California talking about racism and jealousy black on black crime and instead preaching a message of unity and we have the song police get away with murder which not only has one of the most killer instrumentals on the entire record really should have been earlier in the tracklisting because it is one of the better songs and the tracklist though still I guess it makes for a good finish not only does the song deal with police violence but in detail it goes into the way that yg and others may be protecting themselves against not only aggressors in their own neighborhood but aggressive police officers too saying that you know I sort of need to carry a gun on me for this reason he sort of gives these reasons as he's pleading with a judge it's just a solid set of politically charged tracks at the very end of this album the only thing I could fault this record with is that sometimes it's not very poetic you know but from this style of music I expect bluntness I expect the rapper to be to the point you know I can at least commend it though for being super catchy for being immediate for being topical and I can give it to yg for actually coming through with a set of flows and a delivery and bars that are actually worth paying attention to rather than just kind of simply tuning the rapper out and just listening to the beat which is something that all too often we're expected to do with a lot of new commercial rap releases today there are a handful of tracks on here that I think are decent I wouldn't take them out of the track listing or anything but they do pale in comparison to others whether it be because the beat is a little underwhelming or because there's not as strong a subject matter like the song I got a question a little Wayne's verse on that track was okay the song word is bond is alright and still Bray's II didn't really read to me as one of the best tracks and the track listing even though it is the title track here all that being said I was pleasantly surprised with this record not only because it's far better and I think superior to my crazy life but also because I love this freakin thing I think it's a great record definitely one of the more impressive and and memorable hip hop releases I've heard this year I'm gonna have to give this thing a decent two strong eight transition yeah those are my thoughts on this new yg record over here I hope all y'all are enjoying it and if you're not that's fine too let me know what you thought of this record did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yg still crazy forever "},{"id":"TJEvrZHcEMY","title":"Ghostface Killah and Adrian Younge - Twelve Reasons To Die ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"Ghostface hello hi everyone Anthony Pham tan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ghostface Killah LP with Adrian young handling production really Adrian young and Ghostface Killah double-billed 12 reasons to die Ghostface Killah is a new york NC who's best known for his work and his place and his affiliation with the infamous hip-hop outfit the wu-tang clan but his musical fame is not just limited to the wu-tang clan he is actually in my opinion one of the more consistent members of the outfit when it comes to so material over the years he's put out a lot of albums that people consider to be East Coast hip-hop classics like Iron Man supreme clientele as well as fish-scale the only album in his discography that I really sort of steer clear of is ghost Dini I just that LP is just way too tender for me to tender while Ghostface Killah is last full-length LP Apollo Kids was good 12 reasons to die is undeniably a bigger and more ambitious project for one Ghostface Killah works from front to back of this album with producer Adrian young and while this guy is not a household name it is great for Ghostface to work with one producer for the duration of an entire project especially someone who is so seasoned musically the dude is a soundtrack composer multi-instrumentalist and the guy has an unquenchable thirst for these old-school B movie soundtracks that are parsed psych Rock part soul so while the album sonically is is no fish-scale in a lot of ways twelve reasons to die is just as cinematic if not more cinematic for one it's the first album that Ghostface Killah has put out in a while that tries to string together a strong narrative from beginning to end this album is coming out through a record label affiliated with another root Tang member the RZA and apparently there's a comic book that has inspired the narrative of this album or vice versa while on the surface this does completely breathe gimmick gimmick ah gimmick the album does sort of live up to this connection to the comic book with a lot of strong features from wit affiliates RZA occasionally popping in to kind of move the storyline along with some narrations Ghostface Killah 'he's very vivid and directional linear storytelling through his verses and of course adrian young's very soundtrack influenced production style these guys together definitely do not let the concept of 12 reasons to die overshadow the listening experience it enhances it instead if there is one negative about this LP though right from the get-go for people who are familiar with Ghostface Killah ghost is not exactly creative or inventive when it comes to creating this brand new character for him to kind of act out in this new album because a lot like on fish-scale Ghostface Killah finds himself again being a drugged on movin keys he's sort of the leader of an organized crime syndicate there are all these references to italian mafia culture he's showering women with jewels and money he's pulling triggers there are a lot of parallels with fish-scale on this album themes of vengeance and not being able to trust people around you and of course drugs violence all these things come up once again however it's not like these albums end the same way though toward the end of fish-scale Ghostface kind of finds himself on the top of the world but kind of regretting his life choices and seeing that the drugs that he's been selling is sort of destroying lives at least the lives of the people around him and he's kind of having this moment of clarity if anything puts 12 reasons to die above fish-scale it's that 12 reasons is way more direct with its storyline and its concept it's way more focused on the concept there are no real or detour tracks or anything like that separating away from the story that Ghostface Killah is trying to tell Ghostface Killah is a thug he's a street thug he joins with a mob mafia the DeLuca family DeLuca's he moves up in the family gets a lot of credibility he makes money then he starts a war with them separates off from them starts his own gang falls in love gets set up by this person then he is killed by the family that he started bad blood with and then shortly after he was killed he arises from the dead to exact his revenge Ghostface Killah tells this story track by track by track in his enigmatic his trademark gritty Street cipher flow super enthusiastic Ghostface Killah has this ability to spit so fast and yet hit the listener with so many things that are so freakin quickly clear there's a reason people call his rhymes ghost stories because throughout the entirety of this album you get a lot of vivid pictures of situations and characters especially his character well mostly his character there are other moments where woo affiliates come in to spit verses that are vital to the storyline like on the song center of attraction with Cappadonna he comes in and spits this very loosely flowed verse that seems like it's purposely over acted to be as if it were from just really bad b-movie or kind of hilarious especially at the end of the track where he's like oh my god you sleep his eyes man oh she's a set up jack and once Ghostface Killah rises from the dead he's back to spinning those kind of hyper violent hyper vivid very graphic almost cartoony 36 chambers esque bars where he is out to get who killed him and if there's a way to sort of imagine offing somebody it seems that Ghostface Killah does threw out all the verses on this LP but you know some people take the violence and hip hop and then you're really offended by it or they think that the MC is is super duper duper serious about it when the fact of the matter is a lot of these situations that Ghostface Killah paints it's almost just comical with how outlandish ly violent some of them are and this outlandish violence which can at times be very hilarious lasts for about the last four tracks of the album if there's any downside to the last four tracks this album is that they can get a little redundant with this hyper violence I like that the first half of this thing told this story very directly and with detail and it seemed that each track was trying to tell a different chapter where is the last part of the album the plot doesn't really seem so exact it's more a bloodbath if anything I would have loved to have heard maybe some longer tracks or some more detailed tracks where Ghostface Killah is specifically getting revenge on these twelve or so people who were a part of this family who offed him in the first place not only would that have made the album for me a little bit more interesting lyrically and conceptually but it would have made actually kind of feel and read a lot like a Tarantino film which it already kind of feels like due to the beats the Adrian young brings to the table I think my only issue with some of the tracks overall is that not only are some of the songs toward the end of the LP a little redundant but there are moments toward the beginning of the LP like the song Rises the black suits though the song does tell a pivotal part of the story it seems a little short some of the songs and I guess this album overall can be a little short for something that is supposed to be so conceptual and telling a full-length story instrumentally this album is freakin solid if you listen to the instrumentals alone with Ghostface Killah not on the tracks at all it sounds as if the beats themselves are telling a story because you have faster more intense beats that drive tracks like blood on the cobblestone that very much fit the subject matter a lot of fighting going on a lot of black market crime going on fighting with the police that track specifically has this weird funk rock blend with very fast detailed drums other tracks feature very grainy guitars sometimes there's a little bit of tremolo on there warm warm bass some eerie organs as well rich pianos with a lot of ambient noise around them if there's any issue I have with the production overall it's that the ambient noise around some of the instruments specifically the drums does take some of the beef out of the sound that the beats could have brung but still Adrian young does do a great job of taking the flaws that some of these sounds have and making an aesthetic with that making that old-school be movie soundtrack aesthetic but having enough production prowess and is sort of detail in there to make it feel like it's modern and not just shot especially as you have these female group vocals coming in singing parts of the story in this really dramatic way you have a member of the Delfonics appearing on one track which is fantastic his vocal presence on this song is not only beautiful it's eerie it totally fits Ghostface Killah style and the way that his voice is mixed and recorded it has that old-school soul music Motown vibe to it other tracks feel really glamorous with touches of strings horns what feel like tubular bells as well seriously Bravo to Adrian young whether it's some of the more instrumentally or fine tracks toward the beginning of this album or the really gritty layered boom-bap on the latter part of the LP the beats on this LP have a strong old-school hip-hop vibe but Adrian's compositional prowess adds a strong musicality to a lot of these instrumentals so I really loved listening to this album I would definitely recommend it to a hip-hop fan to a wu-tang fan I'm pretty much feeling a strong a to a like 9 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it Ghostface Killah Adrian young twelve

nerd shout out to my Australian viewers hope you guys are doing well down I'm not that wasn't even an Australian accent we're gonna do a review here of this new drones record feeling kind of free the drones are an Australian band on the cusp of their 20th year as a band one of the best rock bands in Australia I think their discography dips back into the late 90s where they predominantly played garage rock and punk blues but since then they have employed a bunch of different sounds and influences in their music most specifically on their last album the very ambitious icy seaweed some of the tracks on this thing were the band's longest yet really impassioned ballads on this thing big instrumentals as well as some very noisy abrasive barnburners influenced by noise rock and post-punk behind all the mayhem usually there's a little bit of social commentary maybe some politically charged lyrics in the drones music - so I'm looking forward to that I'm looking forward to the heaviness I'm looking forward to the beautiful songwriting I'm looking forward to a lot of stuff I'm looking forward to this album and do the drones disappoint No thus albums really great the songs on this thing are sort of on the long side again depending on which track you're listening to but many of them follow a very linear structure have very dynamic instrumentals that usually swell to a really big finish at the end and I think this record holds some of the drones most stirring heavy sour and colourful sets of instrumentals yet maybe some of the best rock instrumentals I've heard this year so far and it's really difficult to sum up the album as a whole instrumentally because each track really goes for a different mood a different flavor a different style the song boredom which is one of my favorites on here has this kind of erratic danceable quality to it where the beats are clearly a little synthetic and sequenced so in a way it's kind of electronic it's the Borden's making electronic music here but the sounds are really though organic the groove is awesome so the track still has the punch in the aggression of a rock band despite having kind of this robotic rigidity and frontman gareth littered on this thing is almost rapping in a way with some spoken word vocals that are riding a tempo and he's got this cocky charismatic delivery that i like a lot just a barrage or different references thrown out in these very dense verses and there is a really overwhelming guitar solo on this thing that i think is not only performed well but it's edited down for just more studio trickery and bells and whistles it sounds more like a really disorienting sound collage than it does just your average guitar solo and that's the thing about this album as a whole while it all sounds very raw and organic and punchy and the instrumentation has a lot of interplay it seems heavily edited like a lot of overdubbing just a lot added into this record just a lot of meaty details worked into these songs it seems like these tracks were very carefully and very densely produced so we have this track boredom over here but then things switch gears like on the song sometimes which actually has vocals from Fiona Kitsch tin fronting the vocals here and this track is like the drones weird and twisted take on like it's a splash of Portishead maybe a little bit of Bjork to the beat is in three four and even though it is one of the more subtle tracks on here it's very eerie it's also got kind of this looming heaviness to some of the instrumentation that swells in that while it is quiet it feels very much like the band could be playing way louder so it's like they're adding this gentle reminder here that like we know that this song is soft but if we wanted to we could crush you this track flows very fluidly into the unhinged closing track where Gareth with his vocals really shows off his love for Nick Cave he's got a very snide vocal delivery on this one the beats on this track are just lumbering the rhythms the groove I guess I'm saying and then these kind of heavy plotting verses are contrasted with these very soft voiced creepy little vocal interludes the band is a great job of just contrast on a lot of these tracks contrasting heavier moments from quieter moments but also making sure it all kind of ties together and makes sense and the instrumental bridge on this thing is like absolutely frightening like the strings what sounds like strings on this track just shriek with horror and all of this instrumentation amasses into an ending that is so huge that it would make godspeed blush and the album starts as heavy as it finishes with one of the biggest cacophony x' i've heard on a rock record in a while the drones delivered kind of this slow sauntering groove with this buzzing distorted bassline that kind of seems a I don't know like it's got a bit of an industrial flavor to it and over it we kind of get these schmaltzy lead melodies but they're being played by the searingly loud guitars that sort of just sucked out the playful tone of the melody and turn it into I don't know like staring directly into the Sun at burns and the lyrics on this track are unsettling they're tortured the opening line I believe is saying essentially that the best songs are like bad dreams and obviously you don't have to agree with that sentiment but it certainly seems like Gareth embodies that with this track feeling very much like a bad dream he goes deeper into the song on the refrain and he talks about how he wants to go straight to DVD metaphorically it's like this song is about obsolescence or irrelevance either falling out of Fame falling out of popularity or kind of causing that yourself by kind of pulling yourself away from the world becoming our hermit in a way he talks about in their frame also going into remission and losing his ambition and he would like a private execution it's like he's writing his own funeral dirge on this track and if that's not at all what the song is about you know hit up those comments because you know I suck at lyrics I I cannot listen to lyrics and interpret them correctly at all on another track I'm sure to get wrong the following Taman should a phrase that it was kind of perplexed by so of course I had to look it up and essentially the song seems to be inspired by a John Doe that was found on a shore in Adelaide in Australia in 1948 and nobody was really able to put together who exactly killed this guy I don't believe they uncovered who he was exactly I could be wrong on that but the weirdest thing about his body or the way that the police found his body is that in his pocket was a piece of paper that said talons should which in Persian means finish and it was ripped out of this very rare poetry book and then they had to find the book and it's just kind of this really weird you know cold case the rhythms on this track the instrumentation is really tense and Gareth matches that intensity with another barrage of lyrics these harder heavier more aggressive tracks are great they're certainly highlights on the record but there are slower tracks on here too that I think go over just as well like that song sometimes or the track then they came for me or another lead single from this thing to think that I once loved you which is this slow tender tearjerker really the ultimate breakup song for this year and the Ballad is complemented with this really lovely lavish instrumentation that reminds me a little bit of silver Mount Zion Orchestra and immediately after this track the band does a good job of balancing out this bitter with some sentimental emotions on track tailwind yeah I mean I don't really have too many complaints about this record I think the drones came through with a fantastic record this time around and I think they surpassed I see seaweed in a lot of respects I think the instrumentation is bigger it's more risky it's more abrasive there are more layers more melodies more textures more flavours the songs I think are great nothing too straightforward but nothing too obtuse either I think there's a good balance between the ballads and the tracks that like boredom are little harder a little more meaty a little more aggressive I guess on I see seaweed there were tracks that stylistically felt like there was a wide divide between a lot of them this one seems a little more consistent in a way and in such a way where I feel like the tracks all do a better job of empowering one another and I'm just really impressed with the way that Gareth and company sort of blend together this really strange array of influences I mean clearly there's some Nick Cave influence here there's a little bit of hip-hop influence on here there's a little bit of post-rock like first wave godspeed era post rock on here there's Punk and noise rock mixed in here too but everything is just so subtly blended that they're never kind of simply just playing one single genre at any given time the lyrics so they can be kind of esoteric and obtuse at points I find really interesting the vocal deliveries usually have a lot of conviction a lot of energy a lot of passion and they make me want to dive into the lyrics more as I give this album subsequent listens as I go in further this year because I mean that's that's gonna happen because I think this record is really great I'm feeling a strongly to like 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would your rating you the best you the best what should I read you next hit that like if you like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the drones feeling kind of free forever "},{"id":"QZkHxln2jQw","title":"Parquet Courts - Sunbathing Animal ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new parquet courts record sunbathing animal this is the follow-up full-length album to the breakout LP light up gold from parquet courts that came out a few years ago these guys are a Brooklyn band fronted by Texas transplant Andrew savage a musical workhorse whose art I have been following for quite a while now through his other projects like Ferguson Geronimo teenage cool kids different bands different songs different vibes however there is a strong slacker sentiment that runs deeply throughout many of Andrews projects the most gripping thing about this album is its attitude and it's repetitive ultra simple songwriting style nearly every song on this LP revolves really redundant ly around these basic punky grooves and riffs and the vocals on top of these riffs vary from talking slash singing really blurring the lines between talking and singing sometimes I can't quite tell which one Andrew is doing when he's not doing that he's delivering all these really off-key yelps or sometimes he's just shouting his vocals the vocals truth be told they're not that masterful on this record the playing is a little loose the energy is a little wild the songs are our little memorable and the whole thing is a little interesting I like where the band is coming from for the most part like on the song she's rolling which is the slow plodding rock tune fronted with these hypnotic minimal lyrics and the instrumentation on this track just grows noisier and more chaotic and more dissonant as it carries along with harmonica and distorted guitars the whole thing feels like a touch of Velvet Underground worship however the band offers nothing in terms of interesting lyrics and legitimately exciting sonic chaos truth be told this song is just tedious and kind of torturous there's just not an interesting song or riff or lyrical idea at the root of that's track it even the faster more interesting more energetic more visceral songs on this record suffer from the same issue even though on the surface they may be more entertaining because they display a more explosive performance like the title track on here and black and white tracks that are fast paced their fiery instrumentally they remind me of a combination of the minimal very strip back simple and basic instrumentation of wire combined with the goofy rock-and-roll swagger of the modern lovers but again is there an interesting song at the core of this very light and breezy ruckus not really even on the slightly more toned down tracks on this LP like Oh Ramona which to me breathes the slacker energy of a band like camper van Beethoven and maybe feels like a touch of solo Jonathan Richmond as well even though I like the grimy guitars the really mundane vocal delivery on this track and the black of wit or anything interesting to say in the lyrics really just kills this track for me and I'm not just saying that it it fails in comparison to the artists that it seems to pull from but I don't even think this song lives up to previous projects I've heard Andrew savage front some of which have been gut-wrenchingly hilarious or sharply satirical the closest I think parquet courts comes to an interesting lyrical verse on this record is the song instant disassembly in terms of the pace of the song and in terms of the the melody of the song it's one of the sadder and more moody tracks on this LP and it definitely captures that vibe it definitely captures that emotional impact really well but this track is just drawn-out needlessly for seven minutes and I do not think parquet courts deliver seven minutes of ideas over the course of this track there are a lot of songs on this LP that I don't think start that well and the ones that do there's not enough significant development over the course of the song to keep things interesting I feel like most of the tracks on this LP are just one little idea for a song or a verse or a part of a song that if somehow been stretched out to the length of a song and all these songs which are spread incredibly thin are stacked on top of one another for an album that is spread incredibly thin overall I think this LP has a good foundation I think okay courts have a lot of attitude just like they did on their last LP I think there's a gritty tone to the guitars and the drums I think these guys are endearingly lazy and enjoyably loose in their delivery in their performance but outside of the faster tracks on this LP at least to me this record does very little to hold interest I'm going to give this thing a light two decent four and a gold-medal of the slack Olympics transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh parquet courts forever "},{"id":"cS0bI-chYN8","title":"Benjamin Clementine - At Least For Now ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"and then hey everyone loved the knee doesn't a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Benjamin Clementine album at least for now Benjamin Clementine is a pianist a songwriter and a poet hailing from the UK who completely fell under my radar this past year but I stumbled across this record after I saw that he walked away with a Mercury Prize and when I gave a listen to this thing I found that it was a pretty refreshing organic beautiful emotionally stirring album however I will say that there was really nothing instantaneous about this record it took me a few listens to really get what Benjamin was doing on this record or at least be moved by it but once I got into it I realized that Benjamin's music is more familiar in tone than I originally thought if you're into dramatic jazz artists like Nina Simone who find an incredible amount of power in reservation and subtlety and storytelling and in vocal delivery then I think you will like this record and also if you're a fan of French and song a very theatrical style of French music that growl Gainsbourg Leonard Cohen you know artists like that then I think you're going to dig this album as well because it's really a fusion of these two worlds and these worlds are fused to a pretty powerful effect a lot of the time I found myself hanging on Benjamin's every word sort of like I'm a song adios adios the decision is mine really just fantastic and very powerfully stated proclamations all over this track Benjamin's vocal delivery is is stunning and the very tight piano phrases and the the swelling strings really enhance that emotional drama and right in the middle of this song it's like he kind of stops entirely to sort of tell this story or just extend the story of this track into this little detour about coming face to face with an angel and the angel sings a song and then he kind of goes into a different tune entirely there are a lot of highlights on this record from lyrical highlights on the nemesis where it is sung that if you held your breath on me you would probably die a million times and then we have moments on this record which are incredibly just heart-wrenching in somber like the people and I again the music on this record really serves as a foundation for Benjamin to sit atop and deliver a series of costume monologues and very stunning poetry contorted dances and emotional exorcisms now there are some tracks on here which are a little more direct a little more catchy like the song London where the track feels very calculated it feels very planned out it has one of the strongest choruses on the entire record but then there are moments on this album where like the opening track Winston Churchill's boy it's almost as if every single thing coming out of clementines head is being said right off of the dome some of these tracks feel like conversations conversations Benjamin is having with himself or in imagined participant so the record does feature a good mix of these more accessible cuts these tracks with more defined verses and courses and these other songs which sort of seem to be very indulgent in their own little world so it's cool that we get both sides of benjamin on this record but each of these sides of the album have their pros and have their cons the more direct and catchy ER songs on the record the piano phrases and the rhythms on these tracks feel almost looped or they're so tightly synced that the natural fluid groove of these tracks is kind of gone it's kind of lost the organic sound of the drums and the pianos aren't matched with an organic fluid groove to the instrumentation and then the tracks that are more indulgent sort of seem to go so far down the rabbit hole that I'm not really sure how to interpret or make heads or tails of these tracks this mostly happens in the second half of the record where I can sense that Benjamin is putting a whole lot of emotion and energy into the song but the structure of the track is so loose and it's so cobbled together that doesn't really hold any of Benjamin's efforts within it it's like trying to carry a quart of water in a colander but the moments on the album where I'm completely unimpressed are very few not so few that I love the album but few enough to the point where I see the potential in what Benjamin is doing and I see the passion and I think that he's going to continue to progress in his music there are some wrinkles on this album that I have no doubt will be ironed out with future releases because the vast majority of the time on this record Benjamin Clementine comes off incredibly riveting I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing Tran you

hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here internet's busiest music a nerd and it's time for an album review the new Thundercat LP the Golden Age of Apocalypse Thundercat is bassist Steve and I first heard of him through a feature spot he had on Flying Lotus his last LP cosmic grandma Flying Lotus actually produced this LP and Steve also serves as the latest bassist for one of my favorite crossover thrash acts suicidal tendencies Steve isn't a part of the original lineup but still he's in this band and he also collaborates with Flying Lotus and now he has a solo LP of song after song after song of just these spacey a lek tronic jazz fusion tracks something is up something is here somebody who stretched themselves into so many styles and categories has to be doing something interesting now when I first came into contact with this LP I had kind of been fed up by being disappointed by a lot of releases coming off the label that this album is on brain feeder records so after a short listen I kind of discounted it but I was getting a ton of comments to review this thing so of course I had to give it a deeper listen and it wasn't long until I realized that I was actually enjoying what I was hearing a lot now if you're a bassist or you've hung out with bassists you've probably heard them say oh man you need to listen to some Jaco Pastorius man you need to listen to some Stanley Clarke dude and I've enjoyed that stuff I enjoy those dudes I enjoy the music they make but the style of jazz fusion they play even the style dude like George Duke would play a guy who under cat actually covers on this LP that sound is just so isolated in this old time period dudes like Marcus Miller and Victor Wooten and Stanley Clark are still alive they're still kicking still making music I think a lot of that stuff has just been stereotyped as being music for for musicians one of the only artists who I can think has branched kind of outside of that camp while still playing some kind of shade of jazz fusion is like square pusher who is combining that sound with with drum and bass in the 90s so because there's a lot of music out there like this already and I see it either being glossed over or people just aren't paying attention to it that's what makes this interesting to me this LP people are hyping it people are freaking out about it people are loving it and people are asking me to review it and I'm not saying it shouldn't be enjoyed I'd actually like to argue that this sticks out for good reason on this LP thundercat embraces an older smoother style of jazz fusion but execute it in a way that could have only been done in 2011 in a way that only could have been done with Flying Lotus producing this thing this LP makes this style like really fun and vibrant and alive again it's like hopping into a spaceship and rocketing through a jazz fusion galaxy loaded with stellar bass solos and fantastic grooves and some of the bass lines on here just so nimble and dynamic they're like doing backflips all over the place like on the song fleur ultra one of my favorite tracks on here I mean the bass line on that is just dizzying that track is more of a fast straightforward lean more orchestrated instrumental and then there are songs on here where Thundercat is actually singing in this very light falsetto I'm not totally into it I don't think it's the strongest vocal on the planet but when he does sing it's usually this winding jazzy melody that is so great that I just fall in love with what the vocals are doing anyway that's tracks like is it love and for love I come those are more like poppy catchy accessible moments where the vocals are really kind of leading the way and then again there are songs on here where they really kind of feel like jams like there's a lot of improvising going on tracks six to eight or kind of like that but there are a few moments here that I think maybe some people are not going to love right at first because they sound a little bit like they're just base exercises but the thing is spots like that are very few now aside from the vocals I think the only shortcoming of this album is that it's a little short a lot of these tracks feel a little short considering that Thundercat is such a strong bass player an improviser I think a lot of these songs could have been a minute longer a lot of these tracks sort of fade out or just end abruptly or really don't go on past the two-minute mark when for me things are just kind of getting started I think this thing could have explored a little bit more so so yeah my biggest complaint is I want more but outside of that I love the style I love the songs the recording is fantastic just the the the the rising instrumental crescendos they're just so gorgeous but even though I thought this thing was a little short of breath I do have to give it to Thundercat and maybe this has to do with with Flying Lotus producing that he's taken this style where you know it might not be uncommon to put out a 14-minute live track or something like that but he sort of pared it down to the two minutes three minutes four minutes and even though I wish it was longer it doesn't sound bad this thing was a really fun listen it's an enjoyable album I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this I liked it a lot didn't underwhelmed me at all I find this guy's playing really interesting if you consider yourself a jazz fan a fan of strong musicianship then got to check this out at least once Thundercat the Golden Age of Apocalypse what do you think of this LP love it hate it let me know Anthony Fantana Thundercat forever [Music] you "},{"id":"94U3CZxIsyA","title":"Czarface - Every Hero Needs A Villain ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi there everyone Indian tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Tsar face record every hero needs a villain every hero needs a villain is a collaborative hip-hop project featuring producer 7l MC esoteric and wu-tang wu-tang legend Inspectah deck 7l and esoteric have been making music together for years so seeing these two guys team up on a record isn't too weird but a few years ago when the Tzar face project was originally announced and it was said that they would be coming together with inspected deck on a full-length album it turned some heads and the debut full-length LP out of this project was okay it wasn't amazing but I feel like the opinion of most people when it comes to 7l and esoteric and inspected deck isn't really you know that high to begin with not that they're terrible but I feel like in most people's books they're usually not really rated as like top-tier rappers none of those definitely underrated rappers so I kind of feel like this debut LP it not blowing a lot of people away wasn't necessarily expected but it was kind of accepted but it just seemed like there was so much more potential in this project than was actually capitalized on not just because of the talent level and the experience of the respective artists involved but also because of the kind of cartoony comic-book themed vocal cuts and imagery and album art that was kind of paired with this thing it's all a little MF DOOM ish who is actually a featured guest on this new record over here in the lyrics on this thing in the previous record - there's also talk of wrestling lasers the kind of cartoony cut through violence that is typical of a wu-tang affiliated project and on the debuts our face record all of this was kind of set to a series of boom-bap style instrumentals that were a little dated kind of sounded like somebody from the mid or early 2000's trying to impersonate boom-bap style hip-hop rather than you know like a true blue genuine reinterpretation however I feel like that's what we're actually getting on this new project over here 7l brings the grime he brings the bass there are some fantastic samples worked into these max as well some great grooves some great drum breaks a lot of color a lot of personality a lot of eccentricity in the instrumentals on this record finally I feel like the sound of czar face matches the colorful comic book themed art that comes with this record and that this album is supposed to be kind of setting the soundtrack to this record is mean it's tough as nails but the sound of it there's also an element of like playfulness to it and there's actually a pretty awesome feature list on this thing - I already mentioned MF DOOM we have GZA Method Man large professor among others on here including mayhem lauren and there are actually some risky spots in the track listing here like the eight-minute escape from tsar CIM asylum which is actually really fantastic justifies its very long length thanks to the multiple kind of beat change ups that the song kind of moves through over the course of its length if I could sum this record up in any way it's kind of like this direct fusion of MF DOOM and wu-tang isms together complemented by these really great rap flows and raw ass rhymes and the flows and the deliveries are so energetic there's so much I guess I would say enthusiasm on this record which is a great change of pace because there are a lot of moments on the last our face album where esoteric and Inspectah deck didn't really sound that amped to be making this album and I'm not really sure what about it made it that way but I would say it's it's like a night and day difference on this project over here because like the chemistry is is through the roof especially on the track lumberjack match which is one of the earlier songs in the track listing here we get relentless flows and verses just throughout the song and deck and esoteric transition into some really catchy flows on the very next track over here with this booming jump the fuck up Basie beat that complements Method Man style very well when he pops onto the track there are even moments on here like on the song the great where we get some pretty funny hooks like I'm straight y'all got it twisted I'm great y'all not as gifted this album has a serious sense of humor sometimes - and again I have to emphasize good hooks on this thing even though some of them may be kind of simple I love the sort of eerie subtle tone down approach to the chorus on the song Red Alert red alert Oh Red Alert red alert a song whose instrumental also features one of the sickest grooves on the entire project and as far as what this album is doing in terms of lyricism I mean this album meets the standard that you would typically expect from a guy who was cut from inspected decks cloth and and inspected deck while he does have some of the best verses on wu-tang's projects he's a guy whose talents I don't think have always been showcased that well when it's come to solo efforts but it's on this record over here that I feel like you know after years of just one underappreciated solo record after another he comes through with just a really fire collaborative project him and 7l and esoteric really lit this thing up and the features list isn't only just impressive in name but pretty much every single person here comes through with a great verse and a lot of enthusiasm there's a lot of passion in the guest verses on this project I mean GZA for one his verse is killer and he sounded just almost nearly asleep on the last we album even doom doesn't slouch and you know some of his stuff has been bordering on lazy a little bit lately but easily toward the end of this album re the rugged man had moved what one of my favourite and and I think most hilarious verses on the entire project I mean just his flow is over-the-top vulgarity just totally matched the character of this album he was entertaining and it was it was kind of like you know the big firework explosion to end this album off in terms of features anyway I think my only main complaint about this project is that there are a few tracks on here that are a little short a little short of breath could have slipped easily into the last record you know didn't really feel like ZAR face it had kind of improved on all fronts like they did on most of the songs here it's just a handful of tracks that are kind of like paling in comparison to others really not really anything that's kind of Dee railing the quality of the track listing here for the most part the songs that aren't as great just kind of breezed by and and those moments are really kind of few and far between as I said there's a lot of passion in this project a lot of grit a lot of personality and I think a lot of skill and it's just an added bonus that it's very colorfully and fantastically produced I'm feeling a decent eight on this thing Tran ten have you given this a project to listen if you have what you think of it you'll love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it that's it guys Anthony Fantana czar face forever "},{"id":"-NI4-QvHv9M","title":"Recondite- On Acid ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"oh no it's perfect hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music and it's time for an album review re conduct on acid this guy this guy's a German producer this is his debut album he built up to this release with a few self-released EPS on a label that describes itself as a platform for deep in melancholic electronic music there eight tracks on the cell peace spanning around an hour of music but two of the songs are remixes by other artists of songs already on this album which is a bit unorthodox but we're not in Kansas anymore are we and the basic concept of this LP which is referenced in its title is to experiment with the basic sounds of acid house music alter it at its most basic elements which includes embracing beats and rhythms that are hypnotic and trance inducing and including the uniquely sharp sounds of the roland tb-303 bass synthesizer which was creating the extremely abrasive squelching sounds that were tearing ears apart years before people were complaining about all these distorted wobbling bass web webs in modern dubstep now the T V 303 was originally meant to be a practicing aid for solo guitarists but as somehow found a very cozy home in electronic music and it made a lot of noise on some pretty popular tracks including Fatboy Slim's everybody needs a 303 and futures acid tracks which is the single kind of credited with forming the acid house style the style that recondite is altering on this album and not only is his approach to acid house music very minimal atmospheric open kind of bleak simplistic but what sort of makes these tracks stand out is his use of that tb-303 how he produces sounds with this instrument is kind of surprising because the tracks sound kind of beautiful he sequences the tb-303 on this thing so delicately and and so sparsely on a lot of these tracks creating some melodies that have a very odd beauty to them almost like a fragility as well like on the track tie in which nears almost ten minutes the tb-303 sounds on that track just bounce on the tempo literally with a splash of reverb they bounce on the tempo so sombrely and the 303 phrases are even simpler on the track felicity where rekon die is kind of altering the tonality of the track but not over driving it to the point where it starts squelching or starts distorting for the most part he is bringing the sounds just short of that threshold just barely pushing it because he just wants to keep his sup on these tracks the track Harbinger sees him putting some extreme reverb on the 303 really making it cascade over itself as it's playing these sequences and the song of sultry is just that and he plays the three of three having it call out as if it were like a siren or something like it was really singing really changing the sustain of the notes as it is singing this one phrase over and over so he definitely knows his way around a 303 or a 303 mock-up or you know some kind of 303 program on a computer either way he is making really great use of it but his talents don't stop there he's no slouch when it comes to programming a beat to the beats on this thing are very quiet they're very subtle and extremely entrancing too and he progresses them very nicely across every single track whether the song's four minutes or it's nine minutes the six tracks recon back puts on this LP are very deep build and showcase a lot of finite differences between them but most importantly besides the mastery of the 303 and the very nice rhythms the extremely nice rhythms that then that are showcased throughout this album there is a very strong emotional palette coming from this album - this is very emotive electronic music it is very sad music beautifully sad forlorn slightly depressing it's very chilly it's it's kind of frostbitten overall I wish this album was longer I wish it had some more tracks the two remixes on this thing one from Tin Man and another one from scuba are pretty decent they showcase a nice subtlety to them just like recon Deitz productions do so it's not like when I come across them they really take me out of the mood of the album which is really all I can ask for while I do feel like recon died on this album showcases some really unique talents this album still just kind of feels like a collection of tracks and I feel like he acknowledges that with the remixes thrown into the mix feeling a light decent eight on this thing take a listen to it and when you do you know let me know what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next

live here because you don't have a job you already pawn my words hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here it's busy it's music nerd and it's time for a review bad bad not good very hold on your partner you're you just started the review and you're you're already saying it's big just give it a chance bad bad not good BB ng - these guys are a young trio of jazz musicians from Canada this is their second full-length album and they really are coming into this genre with an attitude and their own way of doing things they just put out there this this rejection of the old-school Jazz ethos which a lot of people take issue with because there are a lot of sacred cows and jazz that you're not supposed to stomp all over in a way I think it's kind of a good thing because constantly praising the same forefather artists over and over again and also not allowing any new ideas to seep in the intent may be preservation but the result is always decay I wouldn't say bad bad not good as a complete rejection of the old way of doing things though between the instrumentation that these guys make use of piano bass drums there's actually some some guest saxophone playing on here the improvisation and interplay on a lot of these tracks and the fact that these guys reinterpret pre-existing material I would say the Jazz foundation is pretty firm underneath these guys it's just that these guys for the most part when they do cover a song it's a hip-hop song it's B music or an instrumental it's electronic music so while the execution is ultimately jazz the source material is is what ends up making bad bad not good feel new and current and different the band's last full-length album which I reviewed gave a positive review - did reinterpretations of everything from an Oz instrumental to Gangstar they even covered some some Zelda songs from ocarina of time and the forecast this time around is much different on the last LP original material was was pretty scan but in contrast this album a quarter of it is original material there's some odd future covers on here of course it opens up with Earl and then goes later into a medley that has been kind of kicking around and the bad bad not good Canon for a while this mix of title of the creators bastard and Gucci means lemonade toward the end of this LP they cover Kanye's flashing lights they even do a couple genes blade covers on this thing as well as a My Bloody Valentine covered and the whole album the song recipe is is different the mixture is different and the presentation of these songs is different this time around - these guys have upped the production quality a lot to me the pianos feel much more resonant much heavier bigger the drums just come through much clearer they don't always have that same boom-bap texture on them a lot more sonic variety on the drums throughout this LP the bass sounds nice and warm the electric bass there's a lot more upright bass on this thing - and the saxophone that appears on a couple tracks on here sounds great as well there's even a pretty distorted guitar on that My Bloody Valentine cover toward the end and there's just a variety of different keyboard sounds on this thing as well from the grande large acoustic piano that's on Ron decay or limit for your love the fat distorted heavy scents on Earl and sometimes there are these very smooth icy synthesizers that appear on a few tracks here and of course that really sharp sharp electric piano sound that was on the band's last album it sounds even sharper now like marbles hitting glass and like I said I feel like there's more interplay on this LP - Alex for example is improving on his drums a lot more on this LP throwing little changes into his rhythms not just playing it straight and when these guys jam they are jamming a lot harder on this thing on the last album some of the solos though I did like the album I felt like they could have gone harder they could have just dug into the song more I imagine a song is kind of being like a room and when you're playing are really passionate fiery solo you're just turning the furniture over and like throwing stuff out the windows this time around bad bad not good really destroys some of the rooms that they're fooling around in like on that drum solo at the end of Earl the bass solo on limit to your love the sax solo on UWM and the keyboard solos on that flashing lights cover are so simultaneously soloing and embellishing on the chords and the odd future Gucci Mane medley on this thing which these guys have been playing for a while has developed into a whole new animal really emphasizing the contrast between the bastard section of the song and the lemonade section of the song making the bastard part really slow dark heavy dramatic and then when the Gucci Mane spot hits they just blast into it Oh shoo it was bad bad not good is just tighter than ever and I did not think they would reach this level of intensity in their playing so quickly because they're really tearing into some of these tracks and making them their own these guys throw in a reworked version of the song rotten decay which was a single that they dropped earlier this year an original song and I'm loving this reworked version I feel like it has been incubated a bit and it's developed a little bit more the track is still lumbering and heavy but the playing is more precise and what the band is trying to do I feel like comes through a lot stronger with how they're slowing down the tempo speeding it up so it feels more fluid as the tempos moving the drums the bass and the piano feel much more together so the tension the track was supposed to bring originally it's just so much stronger the song limit love which is originally a Feist song but then became a James Blake cover is covered on here but they're kind of covering the James Blake version with these really heavy piano keys and then the Tom's on the drums are kind of used to imitate the wubble and the bass on the lead melody on this thing sounds great the sixth track on here Chester kind of feels like bad bad not good imitating a future garage tune with the with the chords and the keys and the way the drum beat is performed it kind of falls into a hip-hop groove later with just bass solos galore and it's really got a nice funky and smooth vibe to it that I love the next track UWM is definitely my favorite original on this entire thing the electric piano chords on here are so dreary and the drum beat has a nice boom-bap texture to it with this tambourine mix it with a snare that's a really nice touch I love the way the groove changes suddenly too and you got these ascending descending piano chords that the player again it just builds a lot of tension in the track in Leyland widdy's saxophone on the song when the tractor sort of smoothes out falls into a more chill groove is killer is playing is really smoky really sultry sexy and flashing lights is definitely my favorite cover on this entire thing bad bad not good gives the song the the really epic smooth and gargantuan since toward the beginning of the track that that it deserves but once they get into the jam on the song they are just blasting through it and this pretty much feels like the end of the album for me right after this and My Bloody Valentine cover view made me realizes kind of tacked on to the end and it doesn't really feel like any other track on the album especially production-wise the drums feel so sharp and tinny and don't have a lot of punch to them the pianos get swallowed in the guitar distortion a little bit on that track the bass is kind of strumming along to the tempo gets a little lost in the in the chaos I think too the jazzy guitar solos toward the end of the track are pretty nice it definitely didn't become one of my favorite parts on the album though another part on the album I didn't really care for the song vices the way the drums get so much more intense and speedy just filling up space as much as possible with fills in every direction but to kind of hear the keyboard playing the same smooth chords as that is happening not hearing and kind of get lost in that progression just building up with the drums felt kind of weird for me but other than that I don't really have a lot of complaints I mean I think these guys are doing fantastic things for jazz and and whether that's intentional or they're pretty much just doing this for themselves doesn't really matter I like that bad bad not good as incorporating more original material though sometimes I think maybe they should kind of let it sit and and incubate like I said earlier in regards to rotten decay because I love the way they progressed that song and lemonade bastard medley that they do is also proof that if they work on something hard enough they let it sit long enough it's going to become fantastic and I love that they're bringing in more sounds and more instrumentation this time around - and it's not just for flash it's not just for show it's actually to the musical element of these songs and bringing a lot of character to them - I'm feeling a strong eight - a light nine on this album I think it's fantastic and definitely going to be one of my favorites toward the end of this year but what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should

the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new selfie compilation product idiosyncratic electronic music producer alias for mr. Samuel long Sophie the musical project that helps start this whole hypetrain on the internet for a little music group slash label known as PC music you might have cost Sophie early on with big smash alt electronic music singles like bit and lemonade and these singles took off gained so much attention Sophie's just really strange approach to electronic music and pop gained the attention of people like Madonna and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu as well as Charli XCX and wrapper leaf people who he has worked with not to mention there are numerous underground producers right now sort of emulating his sound now sadly since the release of these singles which were very good we're not getting a record we're kind of getting a compilation here a compilation of all the big singles that sophie has released since smashes like--but and lemonade which altogether only account for eight tracks and 26 minutes but still it's a collection of Sophie tracks and gives me an opportunity to sort of praise what Samuel is doing under this project because I like it a lot Sophie's solo productions I prefer much more than a lot of PC musics general output from AG Cooke and Samuel and whoever else may be involved in the shadows specifically those tracks that landed on the PC music volume one compilation which a lot of them I just thought they were okay sort of sounded like very average chipmunk 2000s era pop music with some gimmicky production although I did like that new Hannah diamond single I played that so many goddamn times so being that this is a singles collection there's no concept or anything no overarching theme bringing all of these tracks together but Samuel does have some really sharp and strange production quirks that run through all these tracks and make them feel very snug tight and closely related such as hard hit beats that are very danceable but much of the extra percussion surrounding these grooves is really strange glitchy it's unpredictable as are the sense some of the time of course there then the very chirpy chipmunk vocals which sometimes appear in in lead vocal performances or maybe some samples that are looped throughout some tracks they all sound like they're coming from either the same or very similar female vocalist with a very posh accent there's a lot of rubbery sub bass thrown into the mix too it's music that's equally informed by 2000s dance pop as well as whacked out trap songs like I don't know tonight's higher ground but there's something significantly weird about what Sophia is doing on these tracks something really postmodern about what's happening in this music but also incredibly poppy like j-pop and kpop poppy very hyper very energetic very melodic on this compilation you're getting club bangers that come with a challenge a bit of a dare sure the grooves might be there but what's happening with the vocals and the sense is so weird it's just kind of like come on you like it I dare you like it and it's not a pretentious challenge it's not music that looks down on people that doesn't get it it's a kind of weirdness that feels really playful and freeing the music here sort of makes me wonder what alien races might think if the earth at one point were to become wiped out and the only trace left from our society was a copy of this record songs like lemonade might lead them to believe we were a very fun group of people which is one of my favorite cuts on the compilation here it is criminally short but still densely packed with all these what about synthesizers and sputtering pieces of percussion just a myriad of different sounds and the only thing really kind of keeping sanity and making this thing seem coherent is a very lazy laid back just stoner eyes lemonade lemonade it's got this really lumbering heavy beat that sometimes breaks into these sugar sweet sour patch kids choruses with these chipmunk vocal I hit that busy feeling and I went on my mind I love it it's great I'm just just crazy for it and then with songs like hard as well as we get the album's hardest and most awkward and most challenging bangers and it's not like just some straightforward hard-hitting dance song it's like if bangers gain the technology for interdimensional travel this hard track against this really I don't know rotund bassline it also features these sparkling synthesizers that sound like something out of I don't know My Little Pony while the other track here is kind of techno flavored and just features very hard punchy percussion in these really sharp sense stabs the song L or le kind of has a bit of a Death Grips influence definitely something from their first two records with a huge large shot of bass kind of reminds me of tracks like tachyon honestly but with some weird sour synth notes and some other miscellaneous sounds and effects and weird squawking noises filling up the the tons of space left by the huge rushes of bass and the songs bit and VZ are maybe the most Club appeal that this compilation has to offer despite the amateur vocals on the former and the weird bird squawks on the latter of these two tracks the track love is really unsettling and features a heavy sour squeaky drone and a really stone-faced refrain of just kind of repeating the letters of this word lllll and the closing track it's a pretty a little ballad but it sort of reminds me of a lot of those tracks off that PC music compilation just sort of feels a little too normal and sticks out as a result of that though still I do think there is a good tune at the core of this track this compilation to you me exactly what I wanted from Sophie exactly what I wanted from PC music some forward thinking crazy poppy sweet catchy electronic music that is bending my mind as well as just moving my hips and yeah I just you know have a lot of nice things to say about this I'm just waiting for an album an album would be great because the singles altogether so fantastic I'm feeling a decent of strong eight on this thing transition have you given this compilation a listen if you had what do you think of it the gel out of it yeah why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana

of the new Sam Smith album the thrill of it all I see wearing red shirt and knee don't you dare do my boy Sammy rhymes he's a beautiful cherub he sings like a hundred angels a hundred angels sitting on top of 200 angels this is the sophomore full-length album from English singer-songwriter Sam Smith who was making some pretty big waves in the music industry several years ago with a handful of hits of his debut album in the lonely hour which while there were some pappi trashy cuts off of this record like money on my mind I had a pretty big soft spot for the more dramatic glamorous more piano based tunes on the album mainly the song stay with me that was the site of Sam Smith that I really preferred and building up to this second record here that seemed like that was the the same Smith we were gonna get on this album the more mature soulful side of Sam Smith was going to shine through which I think the mainstream could use a tad more maturity right now there's not a whole lot of male songwriters out there kind of working the particular musical angle that Sam is and I was pretty impressed with some of the lead cuts going into this record like too good at goodbyes which not only has an emotionally powerful chorus with these rushing huge gospel choir sized group vocals but the lyrics of the song are pretty sweet pretty much about building up emotional armor to being mistreated in a relationship to the point where you gain the courage to remove yourself from it and you become good at goodbyes the swelling strings the somber piano it's it's a legitimately beautiful track in my opinion and it's pretty straightforward - it's as catchy as it is intensely and directly emotionally cutting so I was kind of looking forward to hearing Sam deliver this gauntlet of depression ballads on this new thing but unfortunately the deep cuts on this record are not really up to snuff in my opinion in fact I think Sam kind of exposed a lot of his shortcomings as a songwriter on this record because the album doesn't really offer much more than banal lyrics quivering vocals God the vocals they quiver they quiver they don't stop and instrumentation that tries to paint heartbreak is being like this ritzy enchanting thing now truth be told a lot of records have actually dropped like this over the years Sam Smith is not the first musician to deliver this kind of music with this kind of instrumentation with these kinds of lyrics there are many a record that is just a slow and sad and mainstream as this it's just that to hear them you would need to go to the dusty dollar record bin at the thrift shop nearest to you or like a record fare and the thing is a lot of these records have a handful of decent cuts on them but they don't hold up on the whole and I enjoy Sam's voice just as much as the next guy but it does not make up for the songwriting shortcomings on this thing say at first is probably the most drab cut on the entire record instrumentally it doesn't really go anywhere it's just kind of a moody atmosphere with barely a song stringing it all together also some of the vocal effects on this track are really annoying the song one last soul is kind of a quirky piece of pop soul but Jesus Christ this instrumental it sounds like I'm listening to a like a Mariah Carey Christmas CD circa 1994 and midnight train come on dude like I was totally on your side when Tom Petty came after you saying that stay with me just totally whipped off I won't back down and I thought you know what maybe it was subconscious maybe just the melodies are similar it's probably not that significant of an influence but now you come through with this track that's a total ripoff of Radiohead's creep so you're telling me you're just totally just mirroring these popular songs just just by accident beyond this track Sam just kind of continues a moding and pulling off a mixed bag of vocal acrobatics over this really grand slow instrumentation the songwriting unfortunately is not nearly as impressive as the vocal performances occasionally some highlights or changes of pace pop up that are of note like the very corny but kind of sassy baby you make me crazy which has all the vocal passion and lyrical cliches of love lifts us up where we belong if only the song was actually like captivating maybe 20 years down the road I will enjoy this one ironically just like I I do that Joe Cocker tune I will say though there is a vocal chemistry with Sam and Yabba on this track that I cannot deny but is there any reason that the percussion on this track is produced like I'm listening to a hip-hop beat it really kind of sucks the dynamics out of the track and this isn't even the only instance of this on this record but it's not like more intimate musical settings like the song Palace are much better like any track off of the new Adele record smokes a number of intimate songs on this record any number of tracks on like the debut or maybe even the follow-up James Blake album smoked a number of tracks on this record I still do acknowledge Sam as a vocal talent and there are at least a couple of tracks on here that I liked a bit but the tunes were just not on this album the production was not really that impressive either overall the instrumentation was kind of generic a little lifeless and to overproduced to feel legitimately personal and an intimate and subtle and unfortunately I don't feel like Sam has that many tricks up his sleeve artistically at this point so where his music is even gonna go beyond this record I don't know I'm feeling a strong four to a like five on this thing you did it you did it to my Sammy why'd you have to do it to my Sammy transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it

it's time for our lead us u of the Frank Ocean album endless I am here covering the CD quality version of Frank ocean's 2016 album endless Frank Ocean is a singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist someone who quickly went from odd future Wolfgang killed them all appendix to pop and R&B superstardom that transition was quick and miraculous especially considering just how little material he put out to get there and how long he kept fans waiting to finally hear his follow-up to his huge explosive breakout album channel orange with there being four years of release time in between that record in 2016 s blonde originally like the project was titled boys don't cry there were numerous like released a push backs Frank continually disappearing from the limelight again and again that again I mean this would basically be career suicide for any other up-and-coming artist but once he did actually hit fans up with new music in 2016 with the album blonde he also hit listeners with a visual musical art piece titled endless I guess to sort of add to the depth of this long waited release or get fans mouths watering for the blonde album I guess in retrospect I don't fully understand what Frank's motivations were in releasing both of these projects pretty much at the same time my first impressions of endless is that it was a sweet sad semi ambient experience but admittedly at the time my sights were more set on blonde because it seemed like the bigger release the more necessary listen the more pressing issue my original review for both records commended endless but mostly glossed over its finer details as I kind of wrote it off as a weird b-side oriented visual art experience of maybe just a lot of extra bits that didn't make the final cut of the album but upon closer inspection with this new release my feelings on endless have changed because this record is undoubtedly its own musical experience aesthetically in contrast with blond endless is far more Spacey dreamy even prettier there is a persistently moody vibe throughout this with an incredibly glossy reverb eachine on nearly every piece of instrumentation here it's not nearly as direct or self-affirming as blonde but I would actually argue that's part of endless appeal it's not really a deep longing stare into someone's soul it's more like a lack of eye contact actually while curling up in a ball under a sheet in bed in the throes of depression tumbling further into an emotionally dark psychedelic abyss where it's just hard to really get a firm grasp on anything as musical ideas and sounds kind of fade away or slip out of the auditory view of the listener repeatedly across the record transitioning into different sound palettes or musical passages we have a ghostly but idyllic Isley Brothers cover dejected rapt versus lo-fi Bandcamp beats dramatic acoustic ballad Rianne abstract neo-soul all kind of flipping by like a sketchbook in fragmented segments still single songs individual moments on this album but they're all kind of melted together pretty lovingly blurred into each other super aggressively even when there's a song on here that ends a little early or feel somewhat unfinished Frank is quick to throw in a musical passage or another song or a vocal snippet or something to kind of support the ending of that moment to bring it into something else it's like this beautiful gorgeous non ending endless compositional collage and while I know this record was not recorded in a bedroom a lot of it does sound a lot like very lonesome intimate Reaver be better and pop which gives the album a very distinct aesthetic and leaves the entire thing feeling like a distant memory even when you're listening to it right there now the entire thing works really holistically as a melancholy bliss some of the musical ideas are a little derivative and sometimes the lyrics might feel a little too frank and that some of the things he's saying don't feel that poetic they feel like just very blunt descriptions of feelings that he's having or situations he might find himself in or minor little details that he might just be making reference to for whatever reason I think the song Higgs is a prime example of that if we were to look at the lyrics clearly the lyrics on this track don't have much in the way of rhythm or meter Frank is just kind of going off at the mouth a little bit it's like a sad acoustic diatribe but the raw emotional performance that Frank brings to the track is actually pretty nice swap out for a much more structured and catchy and maybe more even-tempered song which blonde has in spades and don't get me wrong I love blonde I think it's a great record however I do find it kind of refreshing on endless over here to here Frank kind of performing on a tightrope without a net artistically speaking he's just throwing a lot of very raw ungroomed ideas out there and with some artists that can go very wrong kind of looking at you kid cudi kind of looking at you Miley Cyrus but in the case of Frank Ocean it works incredibly well especially since even though a lot of these songs don't seem to be all that fleshed out on the micro level he does a great job to make sure that they all work together as endless they all work together on a macro level so while blonde might have the better single highlights like solo and pink and white and self control I'm actually finding endless to be equally addictive for its emotional and sonic cohesion not necessarily for how tracks like Xenon's and comme des Garcons x' and unity might work individually I would say the one downside to this record is that there are some songs and there are some moments that I do wish were longer or developed a bit more because it would have brought a higher emotional peak on the album of which there very few I mean it's all a very interesting beautiful engaging stimulating experience with how much Frank kind of throws at the listener across the runtime of this record but a lot of it does kind of breathe by without much in the way of an overall progression because if you put this album on an infinite loop you could probably drop in at a number of points and the experience would be vaguely the same though the Isley Brothers cover is a really great start but so could a number of other tracks on here be but overall with endless I am incredibly happy that I picked up a CD quality version of this thing and gave myself the opportunity to go back and really soak it in because it was it was kind of difficult to do that with it being released the same time as blonde because in doing so I definitely respect and admire what Frank did on this album so much more and also just really loved the fact that he was able to come at this record with a totally different creative mindset than he did on blond and pretty much have it be an equally fulfilling experience in some ways creatively conceptually stylistically this has even more diverse than blonde as it seems like Frank is experimenting with more instrumentation more genres more samples weirder sounds and effects and transitions which is definitely up my alley personally though I could definitely see why most people would enjoy the blonde experience over the endless experience I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this record transition have you given this album a

17 ALBUM REVIEW","y":2,"x":"hi everyone read the name Flamel oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new xxx 10th Ozzy own album 17 Floridian SoundCloud rapper underground heavy weight and double XL 2017 freshmen xxx 10th Ozzy owned one of the most polarizing controversial and popular artists in rap today who achieved viral sensation status off the back of songs like 70 in your hood or look at me hey this student became an ear overnight sensation and since it was these spare tracks on soundcloud and on youtube that made him he continued to drop them through 2015-2016 the first half of this year occasionally stopping to release a spare EP like kids and it wasn't enough and Willy Wonka was a child murderer needless to say exes aesthetic his lyrics they're pretty dark and edgy that was the impression that I and most people got from his double XL interview freestyle cypher performance especially the cypher performance and also from some of the material that dropped on his recent revenge compilation now while some people have pigeon-holed exes like this angry screaming meme rapper he's actually showed quite a bit of versatility with his recent singles over the past few months dropping tracks that have like more of an R&B flavor more of old school 90s boom bap flavor tracks that are like lonely sort of atmospheric guitar ballads I'm not even an ex fan and it aggravates me when I hear people say that all he does is yell now despite some recent reservations and disappointments I've had with some revelations about exes past some of his recent output his double XL performance and all that I was actually pretty curious as to what he would do on his first big full-length commercial outing which comes in the form of 17 this 21 minute 11 track venture into the mind of X as he pretty much describes the point or the message of the album with a very low-key spoken word piece right at the start of the record where he basically sounds like he's on the verge of crying at the idea of like somebody listening to this album and not liking it and not accepting it and not accepting him so given that I should probably come right out and say I did not like this no I know I did not I would not listen with a fox I would not listen in a box I would not listen in the rain I would not listen on a train this thing did not live up to the hype that was set out for it like not even a little I mean there are a handful of decent moments on this thing specifically on tracks like carrion and fuck love and joseline Flores all of which are very somber very forlorn rap songs that feature a lot of bars about heartbreak and death which is pretty much the lyrical angle I expected going into this record but is ex saying anything profound on this album not really I could really only see people being moved by ex's state of depression on this album if you yourself were depressed and going into this album just merely looking to hear somebody else who's depressed because there's nothing really all that smart or dynamic or detailed or refreshing as to how X expresses that depression the poetry he delivers in these songs runs at about the quality of the really terrible of poetry that you see scrawled all over notebook paper on the cover of this project it's like reading a mature LiveJournal poetry from an emo kid circa 2002 only time I feel pain when I feel loved that's why it's tatted on my face I'm that damn numb only time in my mind when I'm all alone that's why I'm never alone in the nighttime needless to say X is boring monotone flow does not really enhance the feeling or the the the beauty of this poetry and neither does the mostly lifeless flat production that is super basic and a lot of the time just kind of carried by a single moody sample of some sort and another weird thing is that a lot of these songs know pretty much all of these songs are about the length of an iTunes preview like just a little longer none of them are really all that well-developed they pretty much just hit listeners with an intro and a verse and then they just kind of repeat and Peter out into nothing maybe you get a hook I mean the song saved me kind of hits a really dark despondent intensity point in the second half of the track but X doesn't really develop that into anything he just kind of lets his vocals screaming save me and these really sad piano chords just kind of carry him out until the the sound and the emotion of the song just gets stale in the case of revenge or the song depression and obsession the music and X's vocals just kind of meander pitifully over guitar chords mostly with kind of mumbly badly mixed singing that tries to convey emotion with a lack of emotion like it's so flat and it's so lifeless it's supposed to be communicating to you that it's depressed but yes actually these songs are kind of like I don't know really dreadfully boring emo folk I mean I'm not sure that's all I can really think to call it which I guess isn't necessarily a bad thing I mean there's some good acoustic emo music out there but there's really nothing interesting about X vocalizing over a set of copied and pasted drums and guitar chords and believe it or not this is actually not as bad as listening X try to sing his way through a set of piano chords like on the dead inside interlude or on the song Orlando where it sounds like he's unintentionally writing the intro to an Evanescence song where he hits me with maybe my favorite line on the entire project so nobody wants death cuz nobody wants life to end such sad very emotion much dark many profound and the lines deeper into the song do not get any better I mean occasionally they border on funny like this one where he's talking about waiting on death with a smile on his face exactly the kind of line you right when inspired by the visual of your Heath Ledger why so serious Joker poster hanging on your bedroom wall I mean if Hopson wrote this shit and he would you guys would be clowning the shit out of it but because X is saying it it's like deep like this album is so edgy and it's so obsessed with trying to convince the audience that it's dark when it's really just shallow and annoying if X has convinced you that he's deep with the music he's presented on this album he could probably convince you of anything and to remind people who I know we're going to freak out over this review please remember I am NOT reviewing X as a person I'm reviewing this album my thoughts on this record have nothing to do with the events that inspired these songs or whether or not X is truly a troubled person I have no doubt that he is my question is whether or not he manifests these feelings and events into quality verses instrumentals songs and performances and in my opinion no he does not between this and the new little peep album I am legitimately worried that we are in for a wave of narcissistic sad rap over the next few years but I hope I'm wrong though so overall I mean this is not good this is a very bad album if you could even call it that it's it's like a loosely strung together and badly written unfinished set of songs that only round out at about 20 minutes the lyrics are subpar occasionally laughable the singing is mediocre the rapping is just average the instrumentals are bland the whole thing is steeped in just like this pitiful angst and to top it all off this album is essentially the musical equivalent of this shirt you laugh at me because I'm different I laugh at you because you're all the same I'm feeling a decent - on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

Xiu - Plays the Music of Twin Peaks ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new Shu Shu album Shu Shu plays the music of Twin Peaks experimental and post-punk music outfit Shu Shu new album well wild concept behind it totally crazy out of their minds do music from the Twin Peaks soundtrack from front to back that's what this album is that's what happens here the Twin Peaks television series if you didn't know is a shining moment for director mr. David Lynch it is one of the most legendary television series of all time it was not only groundbreaking but boundary blurring as well makes any other elements of soap opera and drama but also horror and thriller along with quirks that could have only come from the mind of David Lynch and the popularity of the television series has kind of researched in the Netflix era as people have been able to go back and watch binge watch the entire series it's even actually brought a newfound appreciation for the second season where popularity of the series kind of trailed off a little bit and I understand why there are some kind of painfully weird moments and narrative directions in that second season but it's still kind of enjoyable now shoo shoo they have some great records under their belts at this point and I do enjoy a lot of their cover songs I know they've covered Joy Division and Rihanna and one of my favorite records in their discography is a covers album the album Nina where they do nothing but Nina Simone covers I believe I have a copy of that sitting in my record collection just imagine it imagine it in your mind it's in my record collection that's sitting there you've probably seen it before if you've been watching the videos for a long time I predict that if you use the search bar the needle drop Shu Shu Nina review it'll pop right up I really enjoyed the reinterpretations of these Nina Simone songs on this record so obviously Shu Shu has already proven themselves to have the ability to reinterpret another piece of music very creatively and I do like the music of Twin Peaks so it would be interesting to kind hear that music celebrated and filtered through that very strange shoo-shoo lens which in a way could be a challenge trying to make a record like that and not have it sound like just a random sporadic array of tracks because there are so many different musical flavors just as there are elements of jazz music of ambient music of dream pop and how is shoo-shoo going to make all these sounds come together and the answer to that question is very well they make them come together very well shoo-shoo gives nearly every single track that they cover on this record a horrific ly eerie vibe there is a frightening rendition of the song falling which actually opened the show up if you remember and Shu shus version is complemented strangely but also beautifully with Jaime's very erratic foot a soft-shoe shoe with these tracks they really go the distance they're not like cheating anybody out of an experience on these songs they're performing five six seven minute versions of these tracks so they're they're really dedicated here because the entire album is over an hour of material and yet it just flows so well and every track is so engaging that it doesn't really feel like an hour it all breezes by pretty quickly in my opinion even the very trudging and heavy track dedicated to Laura Palmer her theme in the show is so tense creating tension in music that sense of dread shoo-shoo doesn't so well on this track and the iconic piano chord burn just go over so well and they're complemented with this kind of shocking like gunshot percussion the backing instrumentation blossoms really nicely as the composition moves from that dreary passage to the chords really kind of changing flavor into something more I guess grand and harmonious which is something that's always been kind of mysterious to me about this particular song in the Twin Peaks soundtrack how this sort of goes from cold to warm and heavenly and just a few chord changes is awesome and Shu Shu plays through those chord changes really well one of the dream pop tracks on the record which had some very easygoing instrumentation that had melodies that were subtly sinister the track into the night goes over really well too Shu Shu raps this track in almost just a hellish drone there's just a very dark atmosphere to this cut while the jazz piece Audrey's dance which is really slithering and suspicious kind of has this a nightmarish quality added to the already mysterious sound the song has much of the original Twin Peaks soundtrack is super mellow and even though Shu Shu stays true to a lot of the musical characteristics of these songs they make them so much more harsh and in-your-face and aggressive the song blue Frank I think Shu Shu takes maybe the most liberties with at one time it was this kind of Spacey lowdown dirty bluesy rock track and Jews interpretation of the sock over here is like psychedelic noise rock it's a total fury of wailing guitars the bass in the backing beat in the chord progression stay pretty true to the songs roots but just what they do on top of these foundational pieces is just pure mayhem the song sycamore trees which is pretty infamous for its heavy vibrato on the lead vocals from Jimmy Scott I believe is done pretty well - it sounds like a cut that could have made it off of Shu shus nina covers album it has very sparse simple pianos and Jamie on top of it with his voice just going completely oh I love what he does vocally you know he's a very eccentric singer so to me it would take someone like him to come on to a track like this and appreciate how eccentric the vocals are on the original and sort of put his own spin on it put his own personality into it and to close the whole thing out we have the very disturbing Josie's past which is so much about Josie the character in the show it's more a drone kind of an abstract song piece with what sounds like some vocal snippet voiced by somebody who is supposed to be Laura Palmer or maybe we're hearing something from Laura Palmer's diary I'm not totally sure maybe it's something to do with the show that I'm not fully aware of please enlighten me I'm not an expert over here but but essentially on this cut we have Laura Palmer sort of explaining or going into detail talking about the abuse and the sexual exploitation that she suffered at the hands of this very evil Bob character that we learn about in the show and what is said here added to these really tense and sour drones hanging in the background it's it's pretty sickening any very stomach-churning finish to this record the only thing left I have to say about this record is that I'm just thoroughly impressed with how great it came out of course shoo-shoo couldn't have done this without the great source material so we have to say thank you and give a shout out to Angelo Badalamenti for composing these fantastic songs but the liberties that shoo-shoo takes with these tracks not only do they make them these songs sort of digestible in kind of that full-length album sense but also the the liberties taken are thrilling they're exciting they're colorful they're intense they're lively they're animalistic they're horrifying they're freaky and and I think she does a great job of reimagining this music in a way that sort of matches the intensity and the oddity of the Twin Peaks series itself I'm feeling a strong II to a light 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you two best you two best what should I review next hit the like if you like watch another review that's good for you shoe place musica Twin Peaks forever "},{"id":"CJDcbwpsjU0","title":"Kid Cudi - Speedin' Bullet To Heaven ALBUM REVIEW","y":0,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kid Cudi album speeding bullet to heaven Kid Cudi is a rapper singer composer multi-instrumentalist as well it seems who had a pretty promising start to his music career his professional commercial music career in the previous decade he was delivering some very moody introspective hip-hop that not a lot of other rappers were and while I didn't really go head over heels for his stuff I thought his follow-up to his debut was kind of mediocre I was pretty indifferent to it but at least he wasn't like a generic artist to me he had a sound he had a vibe that I could recognize but pretty immediately after his next album mr. rager himself seemed to fall off and not just quality wise like he fell off the edge of sanity and started to release some of the worst music of this decade the faux rock album he did with that wizard collaborative side project also into cut which is a record that still haunts me to this day to the point where I completely skipped over mr. Scott miss Cuddy's next record satellite flight however his new record over here my morbid curiosity got the best of me because I heard it was a rock record actually the lead singles that were teasing this album songs like confused as well as wedding tux and also judgmental cunt these songs were kind of intriguing to me I guess it was sort of interesting to see Scott going in another direction what Cudi lacks in musical chops a lot of the time he has an attitude and emotion and genres like grunge and alternative rock and punk music emotion and attitude are the cornerstones of these styles of music so Cudi might pull through on this one no nope no no this is easily the worst record I've had to review this year maybe not the worst album I've heard this year I mean they're certainly worse records but the worst album I've had to review and it's it's very rare that I define albums in those terms but there have been some very special albums this year that came out and I had a very strong distaste for this one - takes the cake the hair cake this thing is almost completely unlistenable the core of the album is 18 tracks long and if that wasn't enough Kid Cudi saw fit to add eight more songs of demos and rehearsal demos which are even more of a wasteland than the core of the record on the last leg of this record Kid Cudi spends this album pretending he's like Kurt Cobain it's like the first part of the album is what he thought was his successful career and then he offs himself and then he spends the rest of the album convincing you that he was so great that you needed to hear these demos when in fact the demos are so awful they're so weak they're so badly performed they're even less listenable than all the songs that preceded them but for the first section of this album there are really two sides to it one side where Kid Cudi is boring you to tears and the other side where he's essentially just annoying you and getting on your nerves so on the boring side of these 18 tracks Kid Cudi essentially recycles and repeats the most rudimentary of guitar riffs and drumbeats and vocal lines to the point where the tracks just get stale within the first 30 seconds Kid Cudi he might deliver some decent sounds in the production on this record overall I think is pretty cool that analog tape definitely brings a nice heaviness and clarity and crispness and punchiness to these guitars and drums but Kid Cudi isn't writing songs so much as he's writing little snippets and slivers of songs and then just stringing them out for 2 to 5 minutes like I'm confused or screwed or Amen the song fairytale remains as well honestly I don't even know why I'm listing tracks out that is basically the musical premise of almost every song here the difference with the tracks that are bearable though is that they are maybe a little more visceral a little more explosive so it kind of makes them just enjoyable in comparison with these incredibly stale annoying songs there are actually some riffs on the songs fade to red or man in the night and still even in the context of this god-awful record I still enjoy judgmental cunt it's probably the most diverse and wild track on the entire record and I actually wish Cuddy took as many risks on the other tracks here as he did on this song because the vocal performances are wild the guitars are heavy the drums are punk as hell but the thing is these halfway decent tracks are nowhere near as plentiful enough or quality enough to raise the standard of this entire album helping helping help needless to say the slower songs the more subtle songs the ballads on here are even more painfully boring tracks like wedding tux or the incredibly long song adventures which is not only needlessly long in and of itself but it also features this asinine beavis and butt-head skit at the end of it actually quite a few tracks actually end with a beavis and butthead skin honest-to-god appearance from Mike judge animator writer and voice-over artist pretending to be beavis and butt-head and acting out these really awkward dialogues in relation to this terrible album even beavis and butthead themselves can't seem to get on board with some of these songs as Beavis kind of pops in to say hey I don't know Butthead and then the teacher pops in to go oh well okay Kid Cudi's emotional and buhbuh buhbuh but I know you guys are on hallucinogenics where i don't know where that came from but if there is kind of a moral in that kids listen drugs do not make you make good music they really don't you need to have kind of a base level of talent or at least some kind of like sober great musical idea before you just take tons of drugs and then embark on some kind of musical recording adventure because that this will happen he just seems to travel further and further down this rabbit hole of awfulness and I just kind of wonder how far it can go how many albums until even the most deluded of Kid Cudi fans are gonna say wow he's hahaha he's really making bad music this time and there are other lyrical moments on this record that are just so hilariously bad to go back to this adventures track like her vagina is I'll keep you safe just hold my arm and also this one thing I loved no more chicken sandwiches yes I'll pay for the damages hell yes I will say though quite a few of the lyrics on this record are incredibly dark their depressive their suicidal they deal in drug addiction however a lot of the very repetitive and very plain language that Kid Cudi uses on a lot of these tracks I think fails to kind of translate the pain that he's experiencing also the fact that so many of the songs on this record are musically inept it sort of keeps his message from having any impact the music itself is so weak that Cuddy's emotions and Cuddy's messages on these tracks just aren't that well translated not going to get too deep into it but another thing that I have notoriously never enjoyed about Kid Cudi's music once again it's terrible here the vocals the singing on this record is by no measure good singing you cannot argue that the singing on this record is good you cannot you can't to manage if you complete I'm gonna make an album it's gonna be a rock album ending dindim be you know the 18 tracks that Cuddy delivers initially on this album are bad enough but then once we get into the demo section of this record it just turns Saul sucking it's like once you've knocked the person out you're just jumping on top of them and holding their arms down and smashing their face in until they're just a bloody pulp of nothing this album is the musical equivalent to just a mile of hot coal walking it is sadistic really what Kid Cudi is doing to his listeners by no standard is this a good or even a punk rock album he's lost his mind he's just off the deep end okay and not even like a you know you know in a way where he's like doing this Captain Beefheart kind of thing where his music is just so whacked out and just so strange no we can get it it's not like that at all it's like he's at such a high level of delusion that this becomes what you want to release as your album 90 minutes of this if I talk about this thing anymore the migraine that this album the seed of a migraine that this album planted in my head is going to get worse so for my sake for your sake let's just call it here I'm feeling a zero on this record a big fat goose egg you know there are a few riffs here and there that are somewhat okay but then the ridiculous lyrics and the beavis and butt-head sketches just pull away from anything that this album had in terms of a saving grace including the final moments of the record the old demo section I'm gonna just leave by in your eat ate another kid cuddly you know you think you gotta be no gun notice there's no cow thing going on here okay there's no cow thing going on here this video is over there's no more jokes there's no it's done okay it's over so bye "},{"id":"om3JC1JSdnI","title":"Jean Grae x Quelle Chris - Everything's Fine ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone flea theny would tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a view of this new Jean Grey and Kweli Chris album everything's fine this is a new collaborative album from two of my favorite underground rappers gray and Kweli Chris Chris is an abstract hip hop artist who really kind of pushes the boundaries of that label he struck me back in 2013 with a record that I thought had something really special on it his his album ghost at the finish line an album that didn't feel like it was filled with songs so much as impressions of songs but songs that despite their lack of structure and despite a lack of energy on the part of Chris as a performer still had a lot of very sharp unique weird ideas interesting song topics there were these autobiographical very vulnerable and self analytical tracks on here like loop dreams where Chris was rapping at length about his attempts to make it in hip-hop music and maybe not doing so well in the process then there were moments on this album that were exaggerated and hilarious like super fuck which is still is still one of my favorite songs period then there were some spots on this album that were super sharp and satirical like Chris had a very clear idea in mind of a target which he was kind of parroting on the song coke rap war game it wouldn't be until a handful of years down the road when Chris would drop a record that I thought was was even better and that was last year's being you as great very cerebral very heady rap album filled with these woozy and eclectic instrumentals which occasionally had like a bit of a cartoony tone to them all of which paired very well with Chris's very low-key almost monotone kind of nasal very froggy voice it's kind of the story of the guy with the softest voice having the loudest brain because even though he's not the most in your face rapper a lot of his instrumental ideas are totally whacked a lot of his lyrics are insanely witty and Chris has paired up with his partner in life and his partner on this album Jean Grey a rapper who I've been waiting for a long time to hear some more substantial records from because in the middle a 2000 she had some very good records genius and this week but her output this decade so far has mostly been very low-key very scattered super independent super DIY Bandcamp releases like her that's not how you do that series in general Jean is just not a rapper who we hear enough from she spits like a demon she has a great sense of wordplay fantastic voice she's a good singer as well she has personality and a talent level that is just too high to be squandered so I'm happy to hear she's playing a large role on this album and that her and Chris are collaborating in a big way on this record I guess they had an EP back in 2016 that somehow slipped by me but everything's fine is about an hour long and the flow and the vibe of this album for frame of reference isn't really that much different than being you is great and jumping off of that I could see Matt villain fans and MF DOOM fans and and fans of the early output on Stones Throw Records getting into this record pretty heavy but while appreciating those references and inspiration points you have to respect the fact that Jean and Chris go into some pretty odd territory with with these sounds so while this record isn't that much different than Chris's recent work it does have a dynamic and a theme all its own and a personality too I mean you cannot really get into this album without having a very sharp and a very dry sense of humor I mean this thing is a mix of irony and just kind of poking fun at a lot of sensitive spots in society but then they also mix that with some incredible moments of vulnerability the opening sketch of this record pretty much illustrates the theme of this record you have this fake game show and all the contestants in response to every question need to say everything's fine everything's okay everything is alright in the world nothing is getting worse there's nothing to worry about and it's that cynicism that carries over on to the next track my contribution to this scam a track that features this very slow lo-fi psychedelic B and Chris and Jean trade bars about like Instagram models backpack rappers you know way mint hey sistar sistar fem see i mean if you take chris's refrain toward the back end of the track where you saying get to again get to again get took in you can pretty much see that the theme of this track is false prophets people misleading you hive mind stupid trends and what's funny about this track and and many others on here is that it sounds and it feels like a song it's catchy i love listening to it but there's also an element to it that feels like i'm also listening to ask it it's like parts kit but part song it's like a I don't know Cheech and Chong record for a nerdy millennial rap fan who wears glasses that are too big because Chris and Jean like like good comedians on this track they're just shitting on everybody they're shitting on everybody and and really that's kind of how it goes for a bulk of the album I mean take the track gold purple orange which features this lengthy verse from Chris where he's just going at all these different stereotypes bringing up things like the alright and black dicks and old people independent women as well great contrasts this with a verse that seems like it's all about her growing up it's sort of like taking these absolutist assertions and assumptions about a variety of things and then taking that and and juxtaposing it with a very detailed story very nuanced story about a particular person and the instrumental on this song is pretty unique it sort of leaves me feeling like a little anxious like I'm locked in in some kind of loop or something that I just can't escape out of it's a very sour jazz groove with these wandering saxophones that are pretty nice but yeah again the track feels like I'm caught in a mental feedback loop I love the track house-call which feels kind of like a loaf i warped mutant version of west coast g-funk which comes complete with a hilari boo radley reference as well as a line saying they ain't trying to ride on us we're like cobblestones also Anna wise and Jonathan hoards vocals on this track are amazing it sort of sounds like a a weirder version of some of the vocal freak outs that you might have caught like an early goody mob record or like an early CeeLo green album I love the soulful low-key and determined track peacock on the record the chord progression on this track is amazing and it's performed by these intensely ringing synthesizers topped of course with Jean Grey's very melodic flow it's a good pairing not to mention this is one of the few tracks on the record that actually takes a very serious and dark tone when it comes to some of the social issues brought up on this thing the song the smoking man from what I can gather from the few verses held within it deals with paranoia accusations conspiracies erratic behavior and these song rivers are great ending to this record these strings are killer Jean Grey's verse on this track is one of the more personal and an emotionally potent on the entire record there are a few bangers on the record too like the very aggressive and hard-hitting zero with this buzzing bassline very punchy percussion and Jean Grey's opening verse on this track is pretty incredible too and then there's oash with Hannibal Buress which if I had to make a guess as to what the mind state was that that he was recording that verse and I would have to guess it was just totally drunk out of his mind although this is one of a few tracks on the record where it feels like the feature is really what makes the song like the Denmark Vesey appearance on this record is really good also your old rugge on this album is pretty great too he's on the song scoop of dirt and I love this one line when he talks about how him and his friends are making music and they're jamming it and then he slaps a phone out of someone's hand for Shazam in it then he's talking about his gut and his hunchback posture and then a few lines later like his butt crack showing it he just like did almost this entire verse just about how like in bad shape iasts and yet it sounded so fucking hard there were a couple of skits on the album that I think did a decent job of key being up the the theme of the record may be even better than some of the songs on the album did although I will say doing better than ever to the story on that track about calling your mom and then like not wanting to be embarrassed about talking to your mom it was it was kind of a weird moment on the record that's still now at this point the the necessity of it eludes me waiting on the moon I found to be one of the blander tracks on the record it's very light jazzy instrumental didn't do too much for me and then breakfast of champions while I loved the refrain on that track and a lot of Jean Grey's lyrics to the kind of fuzzy production that just smothers her and Chris's vocals to me was a low point on the album kind of took the the excitement or the the teeth of the bite out of the track in a way overall though I think everything's fine is a really good set of tracks way more hits than misses definitely one of the more fun weird unique eclectic and smart hip-hop records I've heard this year I wish maybe there were more topical tracks on here and there are a few songs as well that don't even feature gene ready to begin with unfortunately just a few but still I will say though for what was a very unlikely artistic match at least to me from the outset this album just goes swimmingly and as collaborators I would love to hear more from Chris and Jean in the future because in an odd way even though their rap styles seem to have so little in common it's a bit of a yin and yang situation because the the low-key and I guess very even-tempered demeanor of one complements the more cold-blooded and animated and aggressive personality type of the other I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ASAP Rocky album testing Harlem rapper and ASAP mob figurehead ASAP Rocky is back with his third full-length commercial album since breaking out in 2011 with his pretty incredible live love ASAP mixtape a psychedelic cutting-edge and one-of-a-kind project that I still enjoy quite a bit to this day following this mixtape ASAP rocky had a successful debut record hit songs a growing profile a gigantic major label record deal it looked like there was really no place to go but up for rocky and the rest of the mob in the first half of this decade anyway since 2015 though the potential that ASAP rocky showed has been continually squandered with a painfully mediocre and bloated follow-up album at long last ASAP a record that embraced Rocky's cloud rap origins but somehow failed to carry over the catchy songwriting and slick flows and lyricism that also made him as popular as he is not to mention the consistently embarrassing group releases the ASAP mob have dropped again and again and again or the mobs inability for any single member to grab the spotlight consistently in the same way that rocky has it's kind of nice the group brought playboy cardi into the fold around 2016 certainly shows they're not down and out and they're still looking forward but most of the time I just kind of see cardi is someone who's doing his own thing now while testing is not the continually flavorless and washed out slog that at long last ASAP was it somehow sounds just as lost in the woods I mean certainly this record is an extension of that whole cloud rap sound and vibe and aesthetic that ASAP Rocky is known for but rarely are the sounds on this album actually euphoric or blissful or overwhelming or intoxicating in the way that great music in this genre should be mostly a lot of the strange samples and psychedelic effects and random ad-libs and vocal snippets come off kind of sloppy or unkempt especially since the songwriting on this thing is generally lackluster and doesn't really have a whole lot of structure to it on top of that Rocky's voice feels mostly buried in a lot of the chaos on these songs the delay is the Reve Erbs the strange effects and samples it's like he's working with his producers to just pack as much as he possibly can into nearly every track here because he knows his lyrics he knows his flows are not going to steal the spotlight because his style his delivery really has anything hasn't changed all that much in the past seven years in fact I would say rocky sounds less enthusiastic now than he's ever been when this record is at its best rocky picks a hard-hitting or quirky or just kind of trippy or psychedelic piece of production drops a catchy flow has some kind of semblance of a hook praise de Lord is an excellent example of this the song features the sharp little harmonized flute leads bumping bass a crucial skepta feature Rocky's opening verse on this one is one of the most braggadocious and slick on the entire album then we have the strangely glassy and surreal buckshot which features these icy synthesizers these really engaging beat drops and effects some rattling trap hi-hats as well and it's one of the few moments on the album where all of these hallucinogenic implications in the production actually add up into an enjoyable experience it doesn't just feel like an overwrought distraction from a clear lack of a song idea the song OG beeper is pretty hot as well features a strange and very eerie synth line very prominent block boy jb ad-libs a very minimal beat I think this track overall is kind of a display of the power of simplicity although there is kind of an eyebrow raising reference to six 9s gumbo flow in in the latter points of the song which I'm not exactly sure is is this a tribute to him is this a shot at him I'm not really sure it's about as head-scratching as the abrupt ending on this song because I mean it really is one of the better tracks on here I don't know why it couldn't have had a proper finish so what else can I praise on here Frank ocean's appearance on purity is absolutely amazing really a high point on the entire album I also loved all the twisted and pitched vocal harmonies and layers throughout this track kind of sounds like something off of a James Blake song and Rocky's finishing verse on this track is actually one of the more heartfelt on the entire record to the Kid Cudi feature on this album is tolerable but outside of that I'm just not sure what to say most of the tracks on this thing are either an utter mess or just severely underwhelmed the song ASAP forever lives up to its title in that it literally feels like it's going on forever what makes this song appealing is it the boring shimmery Mobe sample whose source material is needlessly rehashed at the very end of the song like we we know where the chords came from they sound mostly undoctored we didn't really need to hear it in its full form at the finish of the track is it the really drab and flat beat that barely has a groove to it is it Rockies unenthusiastic delivery this is easily one of the most uninteresting singles you've ever dropped the instrumental on Tony tone sounds pretty slick there are some cool and very deep musical references that rocky peppers throughout his verses but his delivery just sounds kind of jaded and I'm not really sure what the appeal of the interupting ad-libs and vocal snippets on this track are either and while rocky insists that he doesn't give a fuck about a list there's another spot on the album where he says that if he's gonna be in your top 10 he better be number one if the song fucks sleep is an indication of anything it's that you really do need sleep you should get some sleep because you literally sound half asleep on the track maybe that was conceptual or intentional in some kind of way but it hasn't really helped the appeal or the entertainment value of the song and fka twigs while I love her I think her music is great I don't mind her vocal performance here the song is really just too much of a mess for her to save it or add to it in any way artistically that's going to improve it overall I really got to give it to RCA Records for letting a total mess like call drops slip on to this album I guess the label is a really Pro artistic freedom if something like this can land on testing the track features this jangly guitar sample that sounds kind of leaned out ASAP Rocky's drop tops vocal melody sounds like a subconscious interpolation of the background vocals on that Flamengo song I only have eyes for you and the song is mostly just ASAP Rocky singing in a comatose fashion over these very dreamy guitars with Kodak black later on the track providing a feature over the phone from prison in concept I feel like this track should be one of the most experimental and interesting of ASAP Rocky's career the Spacey instrumental the heavy use of guitar the psychedelic effect even Dean Blunt is on this track of all people the kodak black phone appearance on paper all of it sounds really cool but in practice it's just slop the song brother man is a much smarter and much more tasteful infusion of hip-hop and soul with a lot of very jazzy dynamic backing instrumentation dreamy strings and pianos really rich backing vocals it's a super engaging and sweet moment on the album but the insistence on having to fight for something or stand for something in the messaging of the song just kind of disconnects for me because ASAP Rocky doesn't really stand for that much in the lyrics or that much in his music in general even though the track sounds cool at the end of the day it just kind of feels like an empty platitude or a hollow promise there are more work guitars trap beats and awful singing on the song kids turned out fine on the song changes ASAP rocky essentially sounds like an emotionally crushed hobo Johnson nabbing the andre 3000 international players anthem flow to rap about a girl who left him and essentially how exes and friends of his are kind of moving on and getting hitched and living adult lives the track makes numerous weird transitions from ghostly vocal samples to bad auto-tuned singing passages a totally unexpected beast switch with some pretty subpar rap verses then coming back to the original sound of the song with ASAP kind of admitting he has a hard time focusing then he's rapping about what being like a mix of Biggie and Tupac like no no please stop stop this stop look I think there are some interesting ideas on this album here and there the issue is is that they are not performed or organized all that well a great deal of the time ASAP Rocky is an awful singer and he's barely holding it together as a rapper these days the songs on this thing have no flow and just feel cobbled together sure while some moments here might seem kind of experimental and ASAP Rocky is just kind of throwing everything in but the kitchen sink there's not really a strong sense of direction overall on this record nor does this thing really feel like an example of ASAP Rocky doing what he does best or at least I don't know try to top himself or improve or I'm feeling us strong for to a light five on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it

for view of the new Death Grips album bottomless pit this is the latest full-length LP from experimental and industrial hiphop Theriot Death Grips featuring ride flatlander Zach Hill though at this point in their career as a band they've been blending so many different genres and sounds together who knows what they're playing at this point the gang's all here the gang's back for a relatively straightforward release we add the teaser track hothead we did have though a really weird video featuring the late actress Karen black that originally teased the title of this project we also had the 2016 interview video that dropped that was not in fact an interview but a series of instrumentals that were released later into an EP and the band is also fresh off of a really great tour where they showed up to all the dates to my knowledge we also had some Instagram clips teasing the release of this thing of the really odd cover art on this album which I am still kind of yet to make heads or tails of the band released the lyrics to this album early which a friend of mine and I read online in a video which I will link down in the description you should watch it it was pretty fun and recently Death Grips actually put out a phone number on their Facebook account encouraging people to head to the phone number press one for trash and you could actually hear music from this album through the phone number which actually reminded me of a they might be giants old dial song promo campaign like decades ago as you may already know I did love Death Grips last album which was a double LP the fans waited quite a long time for this double album to be completed one half of the record featuring some of the most disorienting and production in Death Grips repertoire yet while the other half of the double album featured elements of hardcore punk blaring guitars some of their most intense and catchy and visceral and to-the-point productions yet and given that death grips is kind of given fans a left hook with every new release they've pushed their sound tried something different I'm just really not sure what to expect from this new album every time I try to expect something they completely smash my expectations so now I'm just at the point where expectations with me for Death Grips albums have been just beaten out of me I expect nothing and this time I was surprised again because Death Grips have released an album that I think is kind of like a sequel to their 2012 album the Money Store like that album bottomless pit is incredibly direct it's tight it's very synthetic and it's very catchy it's kind of like their second pop record and and maybe this was a conscious effort and is something that is kind of reflected in the bit of cover art that shows the phrase very shallow listening because I don't think this record is going to require the re listens and the revisits that some of their previous material some of their post-money store material required to really kind of digest and make heads or tails of however I wouldn't call this simply a rehash of the Money Store sound of that catchy er death grip sound for one there are roaring guitars occasionally on this album that were very much akin to the guitars that popped up on Jennie death and also this album just seems like a culmination of all the production tricks that the band has learned and sort of employed into their sound since the release of the Money Store so now the production here is heavier these songs are just a series of cyberpunk bangers ready to turn dance well into a war zone rides vocals since the release of the Money Store have grown more animalistic the group's production more detailed I guess what I'm trying to say is that it only makes sense that if Death Grips were to go back to a sound that they would have to outdo themselves in some kind of way they would have to improve upon the formula and I guess in a way I think they do I mean this record doesn't come with the amazing you know initial impact that an album like the money store did because that album was just so groundbreaking in so many ways but the production and the recording on this record in my opinion is just phenomenal I mean the money store as punchy and as instantaneous as that album was there was certainly an element of rawness due to how low fie and rough the production was occasionally this album is just incredibly crisp and it's a crispness that I think Jenny death lacked too even though that was definitely the band's punchiest album to date because there were certainly moments especially on songs like centuries of damn where the guitars were so loud and they were so blaring they kind of blurred the mix a little bit and purposefully so I think because the the end result was certainly an album that felt like a mosh pit that I was never going to live to tell about bottomless pit though masters that same free-flowing rage but it also has deadly precision and just HD clarity Death Grips have essentially perfected the art of abrasive ear candy on this album and it's super admirable it's not so much them challenging themselves to do something new as much as they're challenging themselves to go back and do something a little bit better but simultaneously there are moments where the lyrics are kind of critiquing the existence of Death Grips or maybe this return like on the song at where ride essentially states in his lyrics that he could just totally a Death Grips and get tired of this and just totally be done with it or on the song trash where obviously the song is very much a critique of the way people kind of use the Internet to just upload tons and tons of useless garbage but I think Death Grips kind of includes themselves in that critique too I will get more into the lyrics of this project as we go along but the sound of this album is incredible right from the start the song I keep giving bad people good ideas which features this really ear grabbing female lead vocal who I don't know singing maybe the liner notes of the album when they eventually do release the vinyl version of the record to the public will tell us but for right now I'm just not sure however I do love the refrain I keep getting at people that is I gave giving bad people good is it's totally punky and then just suddenly these roaring guitars these pummeling drums just bust right in general no no no no no no no no no no no and it's like total fight Rick thing sounds like something that could have come straight off a Jenni death rides vocals are twisted manipulated subtly to kind of sound really demonic and warped I also love the skittering symbols on the track too it's just an amazing barrage that just starts the album off in a Hellfire there's really just too much in this song going on to just bring up every single element in this review and that's true of nearly every track on this album like the enraging hothead I love the new mix on this track I think that bassline actually adds a lot to the song and the amazing overwhelming shots of little bit about that just the the intensity that the band performs with in-between these very laid-back choruses is amazing it's like the enraging second half of the powers-that-be brought together with the disorienting rhythms of the first half of the powers-that-be with a bit of a grind core element in there the lyrics are extremely vulgar feature these gruesome drug use references but also I think the track is kind of a statement on the band's musical style and kind of their mystery that they're shrouded in spikes is a third track on the album and one of the catchiest songs Death Grips has ever written one of my favorite Death Grips songs period I love that this band is so many projects deep right now and with each album they're still coming out with at least a few of my favorite songs of theirs this thing in my opinion has a hook that rivals the fever which was my favorite song off of the Money Store and the track lyrically is essentially about kind of losing control over yourself and ride consistently makes reference to skidding skidding skidding and then sort of this hook pops in with just the repetition of spike spike spike spike spikes and I'm getting the impression that the spikes might be popping tires which he is skidding out on maybe that's what's being said here and the beat is just so oh I can't even begin to describe the roaring sense on this track just how buzzing and how abrasive they are and the way they just ground just like grind their way through the chorus on this drag it sounds fantastic and the bustling b2 we have the song warping which is a much slower paced song features these Basie squelchy synthesizers occasionally Death Grips comes through with these just really noisy abrasive sense that to me sound like a little dubstep inspired but they're used in a much weirder way the beat is really bombastic and rides vocals are kind of blurred a little bit with these psychedelic reverbs and echoes with each track the band is just kind of finding different sounds to express this consistent rage on the song at this track is one of the calmer songs in the track listing here kind of has this subdued vibe to it that's very reminiscent of a song like get got for example and this track I love the lyrics probably my favorite lyrics on the entire project ride his delivery on here he just sounds so over everything he's talking about he's so beyond caring he's so beyond giving a about anything that all these people are supposedly saying is really impressive or amazing or that these that want people to be impressed with them people that are impressed with themselves those people it seems ride is the least impressed with and there's a similarly measured delivery to the track trash as well as the song eight oh eight oh eight these tracks I think we're a great addition to the track listening in here because they definitely show that Death Grips has dynamics and I think that the instrumentation and the delivery of the the lyrics here is a little more subtle because they really wanted to bring the messages of the songs home like on trash where again they're talking about just the internet being uploaded with trash we upload trash more trash trash begets trash so on and so forth it's just kind of this dizzying cycle and then afterwards we have eight oh eight oh eight or whether we're Death Grips is essentially talking about other people ripping off their sound to make their style much fresher it was nice that Death Grips worked in songs that they didn't blow out to the extreme like I know they could have because it makes the catch of your tracks the harder hitting tracks stand out so much more like bubbles buried in this jungle another one my favorite tracks on here this track to me has the catchy flow of an I've seen footage put together with the heavy lumbering beat of a why bitch got a lie and somehow it's slightly more overpowering kind of like Godzilla stomping out a major city I love the bass II kick drums and the growling synth leads a lyrical moment that sticks out to me on this track is when riot says if I ever let a bitch get used to me which definitely makes sense to me within the context of just kind of listening to the band's music because with each new Death Grips album there's some kind of mental adjustment that needs to be made to make sense of what the band is saying and doing conceptually the song Houdini another favorite of mine on here again incredibly catchy and an instrumental on here that sounds like a fusion between the factory floor and the dance floor and what ride is saying on this track it sounds like he's kind of poking fun at some clubber who's going to Church  is that hair style also the rattling high hats on this track make this song sound almost trap influenced and I know you guys love that phrase the song BB poison another very heavy lumbering beat here and a set of lyrics that references in a very meta way the band's interactions with their audience specifically on their Twitter account where fans react in a very desperate way to the esoteric tweets and photos that they launched on their Twitter account because Death Grips fans a lot of the time at by the band themselves they're kind of kept in the dark in terms of what their music means or when their new music is being released or when they're going to be playing a show or something so as a result I don't know there's a bit of a feeding frenzy kind of mentality that goes on when the band releases a bit of information or a weird piece of social media communique so it was interesting to kind of see the band address that in a piece of music however this track to me is is one of several moments on here also including the song ring a bell where even though I am into what's going on lyrically on this track I feel like what the band is doing instrumentally isn't quite as refreshing going back and revisiting these heavier lumbering very synthetic sounds it's okay but it's not like you know the the kick in the ass that I was hoping for in terms of just like you know really brutal aggressive production plus I feel like these sounds have kind of introduced themselves to me already prior on Death Grips other records so again going back and kind of referencing older sounds it's a double-edged sword you know if you're not sort of progressing and you're not improving in the way that Death Grips have on much of this record consistently then you're going to have a few tracks that pale in comparison to others in the track listing but that's just kind of my view on this track I've heard many other people say they love this song for me it is a little bit of a lull but this lull does not last long because directly after again we have another one my favorite death grip songs ever three bedrooms in a good neighborhood which is this track that features not only one of their best instrumentals god it's so goddamn catchy but one of their best hooks and refrains too and the lyrics on this track really pop with all this like eye widening ly violent sexual images nylons on side bitches don't your table through my head my body through your bed we do have the very explosive closing track bottomless pit which is not as iconic as like a hacker or as an artificial death in the West East but it is incredibly aggressive and tops off the anger of the album very nicely and again the lyrics on this thing like I'll you in half and my  hatch in you lyrically this is one of Death Grips just look nastiest filthiest like most unsettling albums so far the lyrics on here even on the tracks that the instrumentals a couple of which there are that I just think are ok I'm really impressed with what's going on or at least I'm impressed with just how nasty or dismissive for example that ride is toward this woman that he has in mind on the song ringabel where he goes as far as just call her a mosquito someone who's thirsty someone who's kind of suck off him in the band and tells her to try her luck in porn but to go back to this bottomless pit track again violent sexuality all over this song and in a way I think it kind of wraps up in a package the bands of BDSM like relationship that they have with their fans which is a reference before in their music but maybe not you know in such a violent and angry way as they do on here in a very meta way the band references themselves and their relationship with their audience and it was kind of intriguing to see Death Grips do that in such an over way overall I really love this record I was super impressed with it I mean the production just nothing but tightly formed textured interesting and just really detailed bangers one banger after another um Oh mm mm just scratched all those itches of like hey it's catchy its aggressive it's really detailed it's odd and you know it's kind of taking me a little bit to figure out and kind of make heads or tails of what's happening here also the perform is on here our monstrous the lyrics on here are killer not a lyrical moment I wasn't impressed with prior you know there have been songs where lyrically you you know I'm a little underwhelmed or maybe a maybe a lyric felt a little too edgy or something but here it felt like there were some very clear and pointed topics from one track to the next yeah lyrics production performances the flow of the album and the track listing all the songs here complemented each other really well there wasn't really a moment where I felt like the entire album lulled for too long not too many songs that I felt sounded the same as one another you know maybe a few tracks that were really really akin to material that Death Grips had put out in the past but you know nothing that sounded like oh the band's already kind of written this song three times on the record do they really need to go back and give us another one of these tracks welcome to another freaking fantastic Death Grips album the band has done it again you know it's like the is going on how do they keep putting out good freakin albums I'm feeling a deist strong nine on this one guys it's it's really great transition have you given this album a listen I know you have and you love it you probably enjoy it quite as put quite a bit probably as much as me because I mean it is a really good Death Grips album I haven't really seen a whole lot of complaints about it though I'm sure there are you know and those opinions are fine those opinions are valid to a good Buddha hope you guys are having a good one again thank you for watching um what do you think I should review next besides Radiohead and James Blake and and all those very hyped albums that have dropped this past weekend that I had I'm going to Rafi the Wonder either Radiohead's coming Radiohead to come in forever "},{"id":"_ASR7i5RPKM","title":"Tame Impala - Currents ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new tame impala record currents tame impala is the recording project of producer multi-instrumentalist and songwriter mr. Kevin Parker who burst onto the scene with this band just about 5 years or so ago with the debut full-length LP inner speaker an album which at the time received plenty of acclaim though I personally wasn't that crazy about it mostly because it kind of sounded like a Beatles cover band for the indie generation I did not see the hype behind this LP but tame impalas 2nd full-length LP loner ISM that was another story this album in my opinion was an improvement of everything Tama Paulo had been doing just on all fronts better songs better writing and melodies and guitar parts better production with just more varied colorful guitar tones just a wider fuller more panoramic sound thought the vocals were a little better as well great drum sounds on this LP great bass lines on this LP and over time tame impala sort of grew to sit atop this psych pop throne they were the crown prince's of the modern psych pop revival however they seemed to be kind of passing the torch on this new record over here because what Kevin Parker and company deliver on this album is not just simply or purely psychedelic pop they have a more synthetic sound this time around there are more since on this record then there are lead guitars what I think changed and like things changing and a leg things to know changes and I know Jason know like this nothing he'll like nothing changes no bigs Tim I should change quite seems like things changing well it's not really that huge of a change guitar still plays a pretty significant role on this LP some key melodies and riffs are delivered via a guitar but guitars are no guitars I think Kevin's production style is still incredibly colorful lavish full and really psychedelic I think Kevin's use of synthesizers all over this record is really creative there are all sorts of glitches and effects and knob twisting that makes the sense on this LP sound really dynamic and just live in the moment organic and just like with tame Impala's previous full-length LP the bass lines on here or warm the groovy the drums are really Bumi and crispy I think overall Kevin continues to grow his craft as a songwriter - like with songs on here such as the very sensual ethereal ballad yes I'm changing or the song eventually where I love the way this tracks really booming heavy lead guitar melody contrasts very nicely with the very sweet soft subdued verses which are very dreamy mostly the synths on this LP are kind of an aesthetic change in a good aesthetic change I think throughout this record Kevin Parker pulls together he conjures a pretty wide array of sounds with these keyboards if there are any deeper changes to the songwriting style of tame impala it's on some cuts here where I'm hearing Kevin Parker incorporate like some New Wave isms here and there take for example the song the moment where the beat and the keyboards on here sound like a weird slightly musically altered version of Tears for Fears everybody wants to rule the world but it's an incredibly catchy song in its own right and I love the refrain on this track here that the disco tinged track the less I know the better is pretty great - and there are a few cuts in the track listing here that are short little dreamy psychedelic palate cleansers that bring us from one hulking track to the next I even liked some of the extended cuts on this record like the opening track which goes through one musical phase after another even one bit in the middle of the track where Kevin Parker just takes one loop and he just copies and pastes it into this groove that repeats over and over and over he throws a low-pass filter on it and it kind of sounds like I'm listening to an electronic dance music song a lot of different genres in forming this record I think it's in a way tame and Pallas most stylistically diverse project yet and even as Kevin Parker is just stretching these songs out into one phase after another I think things stay really engaging blissful colorful and fun mostly because the instrumentals are great and the production is just again fantastic this album I think has Kevin Parker's best production yet kudos but I do have my issue with this album and it's not really with the fact that things change stylistically on this record I think things in a way change for the better on this project I'm not against the way that Kevin changed his sound on this project my issue with the album is the vocals really on this record track for track Parker sings in the same nasal passive falsetto every new indie band these days does because they think it'll get them spot on the summer festival circuit and of course these vocals are washed out in effects because in what other way would they be listenable now it's not so bad that it makes me real back from just one single listen to this album or one single listen to a song from this album but it is so bad that it makes the album a little unbearable as it plods along and it does make tracks like cuz I'm kind of exhausting as Kevin sort of pushes the bear ability of his falsetto he does this as well on the song past life against some really weird lowly pitched spoken word which doesn't really feel like a great song as much as it is just a weird kind of filler moment so there are moments on here where the vocals get kind of hard to swallow where spots like realities in motion where the vocals are just so I don't know passionless flavorless just hanging in the background it's not really that engaging and then we have the song disciples around this same point in the tracklist which is like this one minute and change song which just kind of feels like an unfinished song just got a toss in the middle of the tracklist thing there's just a really weird spot right after the halfway point of this record where almost every song feels really lackluster thankfully the record ends semi strong though I was kind of disappointed that the last song just kind of low-key faded out out of nowhere and that's just how this record says goodbye this strange record definitely one of the more perplexing records of this year and and not because I think it's super experimental or super out there or anything like that I'm just a little torn because there are moments of serious psyche pop bliss on this album mostly in the first half which I think are fantastic some of tame Impala's best material yet and again I don't really mind the stylistic change here and I think the synth sound fantastic Kevin Parker some of the best production he's ever done but then the record quickly loses focus just out of nowhere and not only deliver some very weak vocals some overbearing vocals but also a few just weird unfinished moments and a really strange experiment and the record does redeem itself quite a bit after this point but it's not exactly fireworks or anything like that it's just a strange slightly inconsistent listen but I mostly came out of this thing liking what I heard and while I don't love this record as much as loner ISM I think I'm more excited for tame Impala's future because it's just great to see Kevin Parker taking risks Kevin Parker has shown me that this project has more within it then I think we gave it credit for even the fans some of whom are not giving this change of pace here any credit whatsoever so yeah while I do see it as a flawed album I thought it was pretty decent I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it you might hate it and if you do why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana tame impala forever "},{"id":"vELbNWkvVk0","title":"Panopticon - The Scars of Man on the Once Nameless Wilderness ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"okay do you feel that I am thinking free right now do you feel that my mind is outside of the box and I'm thinking so free that I'm free I'm feeling out of here do you feel how free my mind is right now cuz if you don't feel that I'm thinking free believe me there's gonna be heck to pay hi everyone think the Neve early tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new panoptic on the scars of man on the once nameless wilderness parts 1 & 2 this is the latest 2 disc album from one of black metals more unique projects of the decade austin el Lunz panopticon's London is a Kentucky singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist and for over a decade now he's been taking the brutal sounds of black metal the harsh vocals and the tremolo Pickett ARS the blast beats and blending that with sounds and instrumentation from the American folk tradition acoustic guitars and fiddles and banjos and while some of panopticon's more formative releases might sound a little too cacophonous at points like his 2012 record Kentucky the dense layering of all this black metal instrumentation and American folk instrumentation created a really interesting and unique sound palette one that would smooth out and become even grander in scope on panopticon's following couple of records 2014's rotes to the north and 2015's autumn eternal both of which I highly recommend and are pretty much the reason I went into this new record over here with such high hopes so much excitement because for anyone who's been a fan of panoptic on up until this point a double album worth of material can only be a good thing now so far on this record the fan reception has been huge but personally I am NOT enjoying this project nearly as much as I have pretty much everything panopticon's done up until this point for a handful of reasons that mostly apply across the entirety of this two-disc project 1 for whatever reason one draws a line a separator between much of the metal and folk influences on this record sure occasionally you might have a funkier track on here that has an elect guitar crescendo or a black metal cut that has a bit of an acoustic interlude but for the most part on both of these discs the black metal and the Fulco instrumentation don't coalesce in any significant way as they have on previous panopticon's efforts each of them are mostly relegated to their own separate discs and to what artistic benefit I don't know because previously bringing these elements together is what MAPE an optic on greater than the sum of its parts when you pull them apart what makes panoptic on unique kind of falls apart to the production on this record I just found to be so so a lot of the time especially on the black metal cuts the black metal recordings on this record just seem really flat to me just kind of feels like very Western very American overly atmospheric Godspeed you black metal with an occasional touch of strings to add just a little bit of body make it kind of dynamic but for the most part the sound of these songs just comes off really average the instrumentation is nowhere near as tangible or as upfront or as in your face or as I guess muscular and defined as it's been on previous on recent efforts I mean even the crescendos on this record are pretty flaccid like the first big one that comes after a string break on the second track it's almost like panopticon's just paints itself into a corner like this is the thrill this is the high that this song has been building up to all this time and it doesn't get much better on the subsequent tracks like the bad 80s style descending guitar leads on the track platinum it sounds like something out of an awful NES video game soundtrack not only is it not interesting but it's perplexing that this guitar lead that this melody commands so much attention over the course of the entire track the heavy metal guitar soloing that happens later on the song isn't much more impressive either now as far as the full gear cuts I'll say that here is where the production is slightly better more crystal clear more pristine and has a nice reverb eachine on it however I will say that some of the songs on here are just so slow and just such a slog the performances can feel kind of awkward and shaky maybe just a little too loose to feel engaging throughout and my third major problem with this record really kind of comes down to the vocals not only are they missing in action on some of the black metal passages here but when they do show up they're just so buried in the mix they're hardly the exciting commanding beast eale roar that I got from previous panopticon's it just feels like a step down but then the vocals get even worse on the full gear cuts of this record they're so mumbly and uncomfortable and I'm just not sure why is it for dramatic or emotional effect lund seems to mostly hang out in the lower register of his range but he can't seem to just grab on to a note and hold it when it comes to the cleaner singing on this record I'll use this word again shaky another thing that's kind of confusing about it is that this isn't even the first time lund has sung clean vocals on his records I mean I remember him doing it on Kentucky and it's sounding a lot more interesting and consistent there the song echoes in the snow on the second disc is really the only cut on this record that features clean singing where the vocal performance felt like it had a lick of confidence to it it's one of the gruffer tracks on the record has some very steady guitar strumming and fiddle layering has a bit of a backwoods country vibe to it I mean I guess my last major problem with it is that I'm just not all that blown away by the songwriting a lot of the chord progressions I find to be very tedious very unimaginative though I will say and maybe this is the best thing about the record I do like a lot of the lyrical themes a lot of the conceptual themes of the album these nods to the natural world the natural order this album definitely takes more of an environmentalist angle a preservationist angle it almost sees a kind of spirituality in the natural world this not only comes up in Lunz lyrics but also in some of the vocals snippets he works into the record too I mean even the title of this 2 disc series is a nod to that idea talking about the scars left on this wilderness that at one time before man had no name had no nothing it was just it was just this wilderness it was just this place but outside of that there's not a whole lot about this album that I find to be exciting or really all that great for sure a great deal of this album is listenable but given panopticon's previous material it just really falls short of expectations for me I feel like I've just listened to one of the more unique American black metal projects out there period get cut down into something that is just so completely generic not to mention on out to an almost unbearable length collectively on these two disks I'm feeling a strong four to like five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you

music nerd and it's time for review of the new self-titled Harry Styles album itself title Harry Styles is a singer-songwriter known for his tenure in the international singing sensation known as one direction whose lifespan was cut kind of short with the departure of member Zayn Malik back in 20 fifteen now the group is not officially broken up at this point I understand that they're on hiatus for the moment but they might as well be broken up because how can they continue without saying he was the tall dark mysterious sexy one something I could rant about for hours believe me now nearly every member of the group is splintering off to do a little bit of solo music and there's no real news of a One Direction album coming out of the works anytime soon not surprising Zayn was the first one to come out with a solo record which was shooting first sleek and spacious and kind of moody very sexy somewhat edgy but ultimately it just ended up being a very flaccid very humdrum debut record meanwhile Niall Horan has been trying to build himself up is like this folk pop acoustic ballad bro I don't know when or if an album is coming out from him all I know is that his singles especially his latest one has been gaining that much traction outside of some initial interest because hey I'm I'm embarking on some solo music stuff guys now it's Harry Styles turn to drop a solo record which he created an instant demand for with the release of the incredible and hard-hitting an epic sign of the time single which was this grand piece of pano rock with like subtle glam rock undertones to it the gorgeous layers of instrumentation on this thing the somewhat serious tone to the lyrics that had some palpable anguish to it over the current social strife the modern world finds itself in right now the lyrics were a little repetitive and I do think that there was a bit of a lack of detail to them considering the the serious tone of the song but overall I really loved the track and for the most part I liked the very acoustic and sweet ballad sweet creature it was a little safe but the gently finger picked guitar chords and very passionate vocals on this track were more than enough to win me over going into this album I had no reason not to look forward to this thing no reason not to expect it to be good Kerry seemed to be living up to every expectation that I would have for a singer-songwriter and it seemed like he was bringing a more mature sound than his fellow One Direction members who were releasing solo music and even though going into this record I was looking forward to hearing a more mature sound hearing a more mature direction maybe Harry went to mature on this one meaning there's not really anything about the songs on this album in my opinion that sound young and risky and exciting meaning Harry is a musician in his 20s and this is his first album and yet he already sounds like he's over the hill especially when the dad rock songs on this record come out to play in the second half the song only angel the song Kiwi tracks that are loaded with all these hard rock riffs over which Harry howls away like the lead singer of a band who plays for beer tickets every weekend at the local pub have you been it's not a yo business really how is this any better if like jet came out tomorrow with a new single it was like hey guys we still want you to be our girl I can appreciate that maybe Harry is the old soul of one direction but he just kind of buffet picks his way through a bunch of sounds from the 60s and the 70s on this record and presents them with a really safe bland radio-friendly sound the song to ghosts has a little bit of a country twang to it but that twang is so faint it's so bland it makes John Mayer's country stuff sound like I'm listening to some Merle Haggard the vocal melody on this thing is kind of dime-a-dozen I do like the lyrical twist in the song about how the track is singing about two people who just kind of feel like ghosts of their former selves who no longer have a heartbeat it's one of the few moments on the record where the lyrics actually strike me as likable and endearing though I do like the lyrics on the track meet me in the hallway but for a totally different reason they're very dark they're very eerie maybe the edgiest moment on the entire record it's a very strange introduction to the entire album very easygoing track with a bit of a 60s psych pop vibe to it I like the watery kind of warped guitars and bass on this cut and the lyrics depict Harry almost like going through some kind of hard drug addiction he's meeting this person in the hallway it's almost framed as if he's going to be buying drugs but the track is obviously about love it's obviously about a relationship and because this relationship this love has has left him it's departed him he's kind of like looking for a thinks I do like the track even though the ending really trails off it's one of the few moments on this record where I feel like Harry really fails to seal the deal on a good finish for a quality track and as long as I'm praising songs on this record I do want to give a shout out to the track Carolina which has this really cool laid-back sexy swagger to it there's something about the instrumental here that almost reminds me of like Booker T and the MGS also the way the instrumentation transitions suddenly on the chorus and starts just really pushing starts getting a lot of shove a lot of bumps and those little not a lot of background vocals they add so much to the tension of the instrumentation at this point I think this track is so well produced it sounds amazing so much so that I'm not really all that turned off by the ridiculous refrain that Harry brings on this track like he's a good girl oh she's a good girl good uh III would not let anyone who I know in person catch me enjoying that but with the songs I like on this record I feel like I'm constantly having to squint at them to make out and sort of see what Harry was trying to do with them or just force myself to be a little more excited for them than I actually should be but you know my pop Tim ISM can only go so far because there are some tracks on this record that again like the dad rock songs I think are just true-blue awful the song ever since New York this thing is a gutless moody jangling piece of pop rock with a horribly cliched chorus the prominent Tom's all over the verse on this track don't really make much sense to me and that tell me something I don't already know chorus gets really stale really fast the song is just painfully under ridden as is the song woman which the only thing I like about this track is the instrumental but everything Harry brings to the track vocally and lyrically it's just like oh it's cool that Harry went for a somewhat glammy Elton John knockoff with this track but there's this weird that kicks off like tour the beginning of every bar every other bar on this track that that makes me feel like I'm about to hear a really bad Drake verse pop in any moment literally it sounds like some rappers looking for that moment looking for that in where you can just jump on and and just kick a verse and the hook on this thing it's literally woman woman woman woman how long did it take them to come up with this hook because it's awful and it's not even if the hook is underwritten when I look at the lyrics of the entire song I'm kind of reminded of some of the lyrics off of the last Zane record not that I think that the the writing style is exactly similar but the the lack of meaningful and interesting and descriptive lyrics is is kind of the same not to mention the stomach-churning Netflix mentioned at the very beginning of this song to and from the dining table which is this very low-key subtle acoustic cut very subtle acoustic cut the end the entire album off the vocals are literally like a volume notch above a whisper there's something kind of Elliott Smith ish about the track how intimate the song feels but Harry isn't really pulling us in close on this song as a means of telling us anything feeling uncool because you woke up alone got drunk before noon and jerked off isn't exactly hitting rock bottom if you think that's a hard time you've never had a hard time the even my phone misses your call line is kind of cute but just like Harry once again didn't commit to a solid ending on this track there's nothing really on this song that's worth committing to memory which is kind of the case for much of this album honestly I like some of the vintage instrumental palettes that Harry brings to the table on this record overall I think the production sounds great but the lyrical shortcomings that I was kind of catching whiffs of on sign of the times really do hurt I mean to the point of like cutting a jugular because some of these tracks just bleed potential in every direction but Harry doesn't really effectively use a word play or vivid descriptions or colorful language or any sense of danger or personality in his words to kind of stitch these songs together into something personal or powerful or meaningful Harry played it way safer than I thought he was going to on this album and now that I've heard it I don't know why I expected anything else this record really falls apart in the second half - um I don't know if there's anything else I can say about this record honestly I'm feeling a strong forward to a like 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you're angry just leaving just leave it Angry comment in

and the Bad Seeds record skeleton tree this is the latest full-length LP from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist Nick Cave musical legend and the follow-up to the band's 2013 record pushed the sky away admittedly one of my least favorite records in the cave discography a really slow syrupy spacey emotionally flat record that didn't really leave much of an impression on me the album for the most part felt like being stranded in some kind of emotional purgatory not quite heaven not quite hell and caves latest record over here is equally spacey and kind of droney quiet subtle however this album sees the return of Nick Cave after what was an incredible tragedy in his life last year losing his son Arthur cave and since Nick likes to focus on evil and tragedy in his music so much those who were in the know were no doubt looking for this to manifest itself in some kind of way in the music on this record now even before getting into the lyrics of this record I will say in comparison with push the sky away the emotional tone of this record is very dark is very despondent outright depressing I'd say the difference emotionally between this record and Nick caves last is absolutely night and day despite this new album not really being much more aggressive than push the sky away the potent sadness that runs throughout this record even though the album is slow and is a very patient album creates a severe sense of tension which pretty much keeps every single song engaging as Nick Cave just performs one emotional exorcism after another across these eight cuts many of which sound almost improvised or ad-libbed to an extent once the instrumentals droney backdrop kind of starts or the very subtle musical embellishments are established that the band will continue to run through as the song progresses Nick Cave is sort of free to just emotionally explore the topic of the song as he sees fit a lot of the time Nick Cave is waxing poetic on the human condition love loss as well as mortality and the incredible amount of sorrow on this record Nick Cave channels into a lot of different things this isn't just some album where Nick Cave is blatantly putting his tragedy out there in bold plain lyrics for all to see hear and read he's not coming out of this record to exploit his personal misfortune for prying eyes and ears and from what I understand a good deal of these songs were already written or conceived long before the tragedy in question had even happened now there is a pretty prominent moment on the record on the track girl in amber which is one of the most lyrically intriguing tracks on the entire record where Nick Cave is kind of going over what seems like a recently shattered conception of death and the afterlife which is set to these very lonely pianos and the dreariest choral vocals I've heard on an album in a long time the track seems to mostly reference this girl or this moment in time in the past that's almost frozen or I can't quite tell you know there's a lot of imagery in this track and the others - that is super surreal esoteric really difficult to put a clear finger on what exactly Nick is trying to convey sometimes though I will say the ending moments of this cut where Nick Cave is singing in this ghostly vocal don't don't is absolutely haunting another song about losing someone but in a more abstract and romantic way is the song I need you which features these really depressing refrains where Nick is singing in the voice of a really a broken man nothing really matters the performance on this track is pitifully sad and intentionally so the instrumental in the background is a bit of soft easygoing rock music which is thickened up with these synth chords that work very nicely into the track and we also have the very powerfully dark and lyrically vivid Jesus alone where Nick is referencing a really a lot of different things a drug addict a girl filled with forbidden I guess sexual energy an African doctor harvesting tear ducts and Nick on the core seems to be calling out to all of these people with his voice or with this song I'm not 100% sure about what it is about all these characters that sort of makes Nick think about all of them in this one track but maybe further listens will reveal that into the future which are most definitely warranted because even without understanding the full meaning it is a beautiful and a sad and an emotionally traumatizing track on the song rings of Saturn Nick Cave is singing over the sparse drums and he's kind of glistening shy sporadic synth keys that kind of sputtered throughout the track and the lyrics tell the story of what seems like a girl who's almost like a slave to her sexual desires or maybe her profession or the world that she's in he seems to talk about her being born to do what she's doing whether that is because of her personality or her genetic makeup or her surroundings or her upbringing I'm not entirely sure seems like she's engaging in some kind of destructive behavior which is also affecting Nick in a significant way as he's referring to whatever association he has with this person as being like slavery the lyrical imagery on the last verse of the track actually gets pretty strange and it actually would have been one of my favorite tracks here if not for the fact that the ending really fizzles out which sort of goes back to the fact that even though this album is a much more emotionally potent record than the previous Bad Seeds album still the songwriting structure and the songwriting style is mostly the same which was slightly a turn-off for me on that record still though I do love the song Magneto which features some of the darkest instrumentation on the entire record especially this heavy groaning bass and over the track lyrically cave delivers one of his most dramatic performances a lot of the time referencing what seems like a sickness in him maybe making reference to a time in his life when he was addicted to drugs intravenous drugs specifically talking about throwing up in the sink clutching the bowl anther scene I consider to be a pretty stunning and commanding track on the record a definitely one of those moments where even though this is a relatively soft and quiet album this is a track that will demand your attention merely because cave sort of performs on this track like an actor in the spotlight and on the song distance sky this is maybe the only cut in the track listing here that probably could have fit snugly on to push the sky away which features not only some of the most broken and sad vocals from cave on the entire record but also a very lovely guest vocal performance from Elsa Torp I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly who interjects in between caves versus in this angelic set of melodies which is a very nice counterpoint to what cave is doing on the track now the closing track on this thing skeleton tree feels almost like a glimmer of hope like a ray of sunshine amongst all these incredibly dark tracks cave is sort of left with a bit of much-needed catharsis after all of these incredibly depressing songs catharsis that at this point I think the audience needed a little bit of - he seems to have gained a little bit more emotional and vocal composure on this track as well it's like he's moving past the trauma of the previous seven songs and now starting a new day and a clean slate overall I was really impressed with this record it is a beautiful dark moving intensely sad and emotionally potent album despite the fact that it is such a quiet record it is such a subtle record and I'm glad that cave and company were able to come through with a captivating record come through with a compelling record without having to change the formula too much from what they were doing on push the sky away wait wait wait still I do wish the the songs were a little more structurally sound but that doesn't really seem to take away from much of what the album is already doing incredibly well I'm feeling a light of decent hate on this thing Tran and those are my thoughts on this new Nick Cave record what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it guys Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds skeleton tree forever "},{"id":"Uge_eyjwPYw","title":"Weezer - Everything Will Be Alright In The End ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"ah hi everyone Anton Fantin here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Weezer album everything will be all right in the end famed alternative rock and power pop band Weezer on their ninth full-length album here Wow their first album came out in 1994 it's on my favorite pop rock albums of all time it's essentially been 20 years since the release of that record amazing singles on this album clever sort of fun humorous nerd friendly Tunes but as great as this album was to me in the grander scheme of things it doesn't really feel like anything more in the career of Weezer than just a moment in time because now with the band being as old as they are there's a lot of history Weezer hit an artistic and a commercial stride with the Blue Album with Pinkerton but then more radio-friendly songs began to come down the pipe with albums like the green album but the grown worthy material didn't really dropping until records like maple leaf or the red album or attitude where we were getting singles like Beverly Hills and we're all on drugs songs that are so far outside the rubric of why you originally loved the band it's kind of hard not to at least feel just a little bit of a sense of betrayal and when fans feel that way it's a little hard to kind of win them back it's like you've almost soured the relationship plus I think a lot of fans were anticipating that Weezer would kind of aged and mature along with them as they grew up but instead Weezer decided to kind of stay in this musical Neverland where they would essentially stay sixteen years old musically and lyrically for the rest of time so despite this lack of progression and maybe even a tiny embrace of regression on a few records I actually did end up enjoying Weezer's last album quite a bit early for me this record was relatively low on BS it just had a lot of good catchy straightforward pop rock songs and the typical Weezer style but another thing this album signaled to me is that Ouiser is going to pander less to the radio rock market because we've got the internet now where everything has a niche and maybe if we're lucky will we not only get some better songs from Weezer but maybe even just a little bit of acknowledgment of the years of disappointment felt by people whose adolescence was defined by songs like El Scorcho and the sweater song as well as Buddy Holly and Weezer actually does that here they make the effort they do it to the best of their abilities I will not go as far as to say Weezer has matured on this record but they have put out their most ambitious album in a while here and in addition to that this is their most self-aware record in well over a decade musically Weezer is putting together songs in typical Weezer fashion with that same guitar tone super heavy super thick the mid-paced riffs rivers Cuomo's vocals still have a somewhat whiny tone to them but still very enjoyable the bass is basically there just to thicken things up the drums are nice with Weezer it's not really the magic of any individual part really it's more about how all the instrumentation comes together to complement the song and there are some songwriting triumphs on this record like eulogy for a rock band a song that embraces a theme on this record that rock and Weezer are both kind of past their prime maybe pass their peak of relevancy and if that is in fact the case then this song is a very punchy fun catchy and kind of a tear-jerking goodbye super melodic chorus way catchy lyrics on the chorus as well and poetically I think it kind of puts the rock band to bed quite nicely and I love the song had it up to here which starts off with this really funky guitar riff it's got a great groove but then when the verse comes in I think the theme of this song really hits home with river singing that I'm trying to give you my best artistically I'm trying to give you my best material but you've essentially plugged up your ears at this point which for a lot of Weezer fans is totally 100% true and you know the the frustration rivers is is very mutual but not on this I love how lyrically he's diving into a lot of the critiques that people have thrown a tweezer over the years and maybe he's acknowledging them a little bit the lack of edge the mediocrity the homogeneous Asian he's saying what a lot of people have been saying and he puts it into a very nicely packaged song but is he only saying what sort of maybe longtime Weezer fans or X Weezer fans have been wanting to hear because it's not like this album isn't without its mediocre moments you have lonely girl like you you were just singing about mediocrity and then you put out this song lonely girl which maybe has some of the most insipid lyrics of any Weezer song not just that but the song is just way too cliche to handle and even further on the cliche scale is the male/female duet on the song go away again you were just singing about mediocrity and you're doing a song here that sounds like a really terrible chien hem tune we have a lead single from this LP back to the shack which instrumentally is a pretty catchy tune but lyrically I'm not really sure I'm that into the concept we have river singing about hey you know let's get out of this crappy singing show stuff and instead get back to what we do best and what we're familiar with them when we know is great and what we know the fans want get back to the shack do the writing do the rocking just be Weezer and in this song lyrically we have river singing about going hardcore like it's 94 when in fact this song does not sound like 94 Weezer it sounds like 2001 Weezer anybody who's a Weezer fan knows that and while in concept I do agree with the the jabot stupid singing shows the alternative that Weezer is bringing to the table here is really only like a lesser of two evils it's not like oh my god this is what I should be doing instead and the opening track on here to over 20 years as a band and Weezer is still singing about that feel when no girlfriend not just that but this song is also an example of how atrocious the production can get on this record the song kicks off with this overly loud bass e and compressed guitar riff that is just so boom and so crushing like what are you trying to prove you don't got to go super heavy just to impress us and besides when the guitars get this loud which they do occasionally you can't even really make out the vocals that well so yeah the the years of musical abuse I have had my heart turned a little cold when it comes to Weezer however there are still moments on this record where they get to me like on the song the British are coming which is a little overly simplified as far as the history behind the song but it's still a little fun left hook patriotism pop rock tune which I didn't see coming then there's the song da Vinci which I think has one of Weezer's best hooks in years on it and I like the lyrical concept of this song saying that this person that maybe a love interest is very hard to describe their abstract they're different they just have no precedent they're hard to put into words saying that not even da Vinci could paint this person not even Stephen Hawking could explain this person we've got Cleopatra which to me sticks out as a unique tune just because of how oddly shaped and grooved the lead melody is on the chorus really weird hook it feels almost as if like the drums and the guitars bust in maybe like a beat early and it's a bit of a surprise like on the British are coming we also have a bit of a nod to history on this song but the concept of this track really lies in aging and just growing older and growing colder emotionally which maybe runs parallel to the whole Weezer rock fan dynamic going on right now that's mentioned on a few tracks here there's the song foolish father where we kind of see rivers very well-documented daddy issues kind of playing out into a sequel song here where maybe he's reflecting a little bit on the fact that he is a father now and has to kind of work through these difficulties at a different angle and once again the song is incredibly catchy straightforward sweet that classic Weezer formula at work once again in this track like many other songs on here work through the themes set out by the title of this album that I guess everything will work out when it's all over and the record itself definitely does that it resolves really well with this trio of songs that are filled with soaring guitar harmonies it's a really grand epic and ambitious finish for this record for Weezer in general maybe some of you might be thinking this trio of tracks was trying a little too hard but I personally like the fact that Weezer seems to be trying at all it really feels like they're putting an effort into these songs and again while this record may not exactly be mature Weezer at least tries to build a bridge to a lot of their older fans saying hey listen we hear you and we know the issue and we know the problem and essentially we're just like a little sorry for it and it's it's nice to hear that but only sometimes does it feel like Weezer is actually working to fix these issues and as a result as much as I like a lot of the tracks here it's sort of hard to be totally gung-ho about this record because of the disappointing moments I'm peeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition though I guess I did totally end up digging a lot of this record yeah you know it's it's a likable album it's a good album I just uh you know it's it's it's just uh it's just hard not to at least be just a touch disappointed because of just how high the high-water marks were at least for me anyway earlier on in Weezer's career but that's it you know it feels like a throwback album a little bit but again it's very much a throwback to like the early 2000s Weezer not the 90s Weezer cool cool have you given this album we'll listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and um and that's it Anthony Fantana Weezer forever "},{"id":"Y65MsRxYYAs","title":"The Garden - Haha ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"uh hi everyone Anthony and tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new garden record haha the garden is a California rock duo this is their sophomore full-length LP and it is 35 minutes of ultra weirdo punk loaded with crunchy bass lines hyper drum beats some synthetic percussion as well along with some odd samples and maybe some keyboards it's like this cauldron of mi a and Devo and Atari Teenage Riot and the prodigy coming together in this trashy blend of punk and pop punk and electronic music instrumentally what this album offers is skeletal but it's pretty odd but what makes it odder are the vocals of mr. Wyatt shears his voice is very animated it's contorted it almost sounds like a joke band started by two dudes just so that they could go down to the local open mic nights in their immediate area and perform to freak out the locals in retrospective of writing this review it's also little Mindless Self Indulgence ish but somehow they wound up on epitaph records and they sound completely serious about their lack of serious now this thing is 17 tracks long so a lot of this album's runtime is spread out among these one and two minute long tracks nothing really overstays its welcome or develops all that far now the music on this thing keeping with the Punk spirit is very simple very direct it's not flashy in any sort of way even on the tracks that don't really take a rock approach like the track jesters game we're on here we have a lot of looped beats a few eerie Cynthia and there along with a couple noisy samples and the structure of the track the verse chorus verse it's pretty cut and dry and I think this simplicity in this directness puts a lot of emphasis on the vocals as does the mix the vocals are very high in the mix and I understand why the vocals are the most unique thing that garden has going for them and they are very standout they are very odd and some of the hooks on this thing are instantly catchy red green yellow yellow switch lights everything has a face there are just so many lyrical refrains on this thing that stick in my head just out of sheer weirdness the issue is though is that the vocals become obnoxious after a little while unfortunately as much as I do get a Devo vibe from the singing simultaneously it's like listening to a mutant Billy Joel Armstrong of Green Day yeah and I think it could have been worse it definitely could have been worse but the only reason it doesn't get worse is that I think the songs all stop they all end before they reach their full annoying potential after a while the lack of substantive songwriting on this record just loses flavor and it just kind of makes the album seem really redundant a little OneNote because even as they switch it up other instrumental elements of the garden sound get kind of redundant as well the very thin farty echoey bass lines the claustrophobic drums as well as the vocals like I said earlier now I think there are some highlights on this record there are songs that I like like red green yellow or the song egg which oddly enough is kind of this weird piano rock tune that pops up out of nowhere sounds like a combination of lounge music and The Strokes one minute it's really slick the next minute there are these roaring bass riffs that remind me of the Minutemen and the freakish in dark devour is definitely a highlight for me as well strange that two of my favorite tracks on the record are like two of the longest tracks on the record but whatever they're all small very likable qualities about almost every track here but they also have issues that add up into large issues over the run of this entire album I think that the garden they very eclectic and very strange and oddball and while these characteristics definitely make them stand out simultaneously as sort of pigeon holes the music to into this one sort of gear that it never quite switches out of even with again the stylistic window-dressing changes from one track to another I think they have some cool ideas I think they have a lot of energy a lot of chutzpah but the song ideas are just way too rough and sketchy I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what do you think I should review next and smash that like um and that's about it Anthony Fantan oh the garden ha forever "},{"id":"J_fZGm7NHbE","title":"Glitch Mob - Love Death Immortality ALBUM REVIEW","y":3,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new glitch mob album love death immortality these guys are a West Coast electronic music collective who dropped their full-length debut drink the sea just a handful of years ago a bunch of tracks that were a collaborative collection of glitch hop and electronic music hybrids a lot of touches of glitzy sort of Club centric dubstep and dance music on this record the group built these tracks on a lot of very large epic sounds and song structures popular dance music was definitely an influence on many of the tracks here but I thought that much of what glitch mob did on this record was too detailed and complex to be just club music I thought some of the songs on this thing we're pretty headphone worthy as well glitch mob has just put out their second full-length LP love death immortality I've always been pretty neutral on the group until now because this latest full-length LP of theirs I did not like not even a little straight and simple I think this new record from glitch mob is Club fodder it's pretty much nothing but songs that feature melodies that get old before the song is even over and dubstep inspired rhythms that are pretty much dime a dozen there are things on this LP that remind me of other things that I like there are some very bright melodic synth leads that remind me of artists and producers like deadmau5 or rusty there's a lot of rumbling bass on this LP and sporadic drum breaks like on a Skrillex track and there are some very epic grand builds to these songs to that slightly remind me of Daft Punk record or a justice record if you're in all of those artists then you might want to check the selfie out you might come out liking it it does have all the loud visceral sounds that you would want and expect from music in this style pretty detailed drum breaks it does follow that modern electronic dance music blueprint to a tee but I think this record came up short because in the process of doing all those things Glitch Mob forgot to actually add some personality to this music or actually penned melodies that are worth remembering there are some pretty cliche vocal performances on this record as well that do nothing but add to the very generic electro dubstep vibe on this LP and when the group does go for something kind of interesting it only ends up like a watered down version of what could have been like the song can't kill us which has this buzzing bass and drum beats that feel more rock centric and these synth leads that feel almost as if they're kind of going for a guitar type sound I mean it's it's better than what Muse did trying to fuse dubstep and rock together but it only feels like it's interesting in theory this combination of dubstep and rock and the song becoming harmonious with vocals from metal mother was a pretty interesting track for me because about slow and brooding it was and I actually thought that with the very epic and sort of sad synthesizers behind this interesting vocal it was sort of like a combination of the knife and dubstep together tracks like this aren't amazing but they're definitely a welcome change of pace from more average dubstep electro house fusions like sky toucher I think the only track on this entire LP that I wholeheartedly liked was fly by night only which features a vocal guest who's singing reminds me of churches a bit and I wasn't really into this track for the loud and buzzing and bombastic production or anything like that I just thought it was a legitimately good tune that would have sounded catchy and sounded enjoyable no matter what kind of beats are synthesizers you put against it I dub the really tender vocals from sister crayon as well in the plucked harp strings on the closing track here too but the really tiring blasts of bass and drums have gotten old at this point and just prove that this record is not all that dynamic or interesting it just feels like a really taste north north north north mix of these really beautiful vocals and tender instrumentation and then all of a sudden this very loud in your face electro pops in and it's just a really silly transition back and forth and back and forth overall I I thought this new glitch mob LP was offensively uninspiring and uninteresting despite trying to be the exact opposite with how monumental some of these songs feel but pretty much every song on this LP is just too overblown for how unsubstantial the sound play and the songwriting is I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this thing try ambition if you given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony fan tanto Glitch Mob forever "},{"id":"3Hbhb5CGEB0","title":"LCD Soundsystem- This Is Happening ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"LCD Soundsystem this is happening hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and before we get too deep into this review I do want to take a second to say rest in peace mr. Ronnie James Dio you will sorely sorely be missed you're the man and today we're taking a look at a new album from LCD Soundsystem this is happening LCD soundsystem is a dance punk post-punk hoop tears project fronted by vocalist multi-instrumentalist and producer James Murphy this is the band's third LP and it's allegedly their last and I know a lot of people are freaking out about that but I'm sure it's not going to be the last piece of music that James Murphy ever makes and the choice of ending the band especially here I'm sure has caused a lot of controversy but after this LP I don't think anyone can say that these guys didn't fight all the way up until the end here LCD Soundsystem is really really aiming for the dancefloor I mean I know they usually are with their music but I would say especially on this is happening they're a lot less concerned about making a poppy track making a concise track at the hot single out there get the hook in there this LP is built on a really strong foundation of long adventurous dance tracks that really remind me of bands like yellow magic Orchestra James White in the blacks and especially Talking Heads I mean these are the drum beats that dance music was not just fantastic percussion all the way throughout this LP you've got some really unique yet nostalgic sense sounds that remind me of a lot of singles from the 80s emotive vocals that are always believable never flat never boring and the production is freakin top-notch and bumps the hell out of my speakers and James Murphy brings these really harebrained weird eccentric lyrics that just catch me off guard and is there a method to his madness I have no clue some of it makes sense on the surface and some of it doesn't does that matter no so you've got nine tracks here and the songs are extremely extremely ambitious you've got to have serious balls to be putting out nine minute songs these days but honestly no song really feels as long as it actually is with a lot of subtleties really fun vocals great instrumentation fantastic building each track just really flies by I know this is the point where maybe I won't see eye to eye with a lot of people but I don't think not one song maybe with the exception of somebody's calling me not one track gets boring her drags on or really feels static each track is always moving always shifting always changing into something different which makes it kind of an evolutionary experience this is a dance floor not a ballet Sun a lot of variation keeps the whole LP feeling just fresh from beginning to end two drunk girls is a really fiery single which I ever viewed before on the channel and is quite possibly one of the most immediate tracks on the LP all I want is a sweet little love song that clocks in at almost seven minutes but has really great wailing guitar Lee it's just a casserole of layered instrumentation and some atmospheric scents too and for some reason the track one touch kind of reminds me of Nine Inch Nails with how moody it is and significantly darker than every other track on the LP just early 9 inch nails and really this is one of the few times that dance music actually comes off as epic and this is happening has fantastic musicianship fantastic sounds production just everything and my only gripe is something that I mentioned already in this video I didn't really care for the track somebody's calling me I was okay on it I feel like it just could have been more eventful but other than that I'm just loving the hell out of this album I can't get over how fun it is this is just over 60 minutes of dance music and each moment is moving sweaty and infectious now I have to warn you if you're looking for something that is simple straightforward to the point this may not be what you're looking for these tracks build they really take their time and they do not edit themselves we have some long tracks here my friends we have some long tracks strong girls which is a track that I'm sure a lot of you have heard is the shortest and the only single esque track on the LP the rest of the album is pretty much just drawn-out adventurous exploring every nook cranny and idea that they can within a given song I'm not feeling a light 9 on this I'm not feeling a strong 9 on this but I think I am feeling an honorably decent 9 on this freaking album it's just really good it's really good for me personally I already love to death the type of music that this album pulls from so it pretty much just hits home for me with my musical tastes I mean I just love post-punk music especially the Dancy er more disco influenced side of it and that's exactly where this album's coming from so of course I'm a little biased in that direction but if you've heard this LP and if you like LCD Soundsystem any of James Murphy's work what do you think of this LP do you like it do you hate it and why what's your favorite part of this album what's your least favorite part anthony

music nerd and it's time for review of the new push a tea album Daytona the latest album here from cocaine cowboy mr. Pusha T president of Kanye's good music formerly of clips you should know who the hell he is by now if you have it please listen - hell hath no fury in and get a grip please please you're embarrassing me Pusha T's artistic high-water marks in the 2000s are our thing of legend and even though he may have found himself a steady paycheck at Kanye's good music let's be honest push his solo efforts since breaking off from his brother in Clips so far could be better he was severely punching under his way on fear of God - my name is my name had amazing highlights amazing high points like numbers on the boards and nostalgia but was also painfully inconsistent and had a lot of lackluster tracks in the track listing - King push was pretty good but not really the splash that you expect an artist of Pusha T's magnitude to be making the thing was also titled as a prelude but what it was a prelude to I I don't know I kind of had the the feeling at the time that this was just gonna be a taster to something bigger coming around the corner but whatever that thing is it doesn't seem to have happened 2015 the year that album dropped was also the same year push was named president of good music so who knows maybe maybe that's been dominating his time which brings us to Daytona which going into it I admit I was a little skeptical the announcement of this thing pretty much felt like a surprise suddenly there was that album cover change to the Whitney Houston bathroom photo which just kind of felt like an attempt to grab headlines it may have been on the part of Kanye West but still it's just a scant 7 tracks in 21 minutes and Kanye is on the boards on every single cut which it it's it's been a while since Kanye has so thoroughly produced a project like this Kanye's beats on this thing are dark heavy luxurious their artsy and loaded with great grooves and sharp soul samples also nearly all the instrumentals on this thing segue into one another pretty effectively so it kind of makes these 7 tracks play pretty seamlessly now of course when it comes to push he's back on his a game lyrically and ex Tooting in his trademark very expressive mid-paced flow something that he's kind of grown into over the years where he just really makes you feel every word coming out of his mouth he is really one of these artists who tries to make every single bar count and puts this fear in me that makes me just pay very close attention to everything he's saying out of fear that I'll miss a double entendre or some kind of coded simile he's truly a rapper's rapper and even though this thing is just 21 minutes I would say pushes efforts here are as valuable as 60 minutes of music with how much play I'm gonna get out of this thing across the seven tracks here I would say that Pusha and and Kanye just kind of bring out the best in one another the opener if you know you know features of course these really dense drug raps sharply cut guitar samples wailing away against some delayed vocal samples and noisy effects it's psychedelic its industrial its trunk knocking features quotables that are equal parts of gritty and extravagant like the company I keep is not corporate enough child rebel soldier you ain't orphan enough the if you know you know mantra on the track is really telling as well because it essentially communicates that if you've done his dirt if you've lived his life if you've been paying attention to his trajectory you know what he's talking about because Pusha is one of those artists who truly kind of puts a bit of a veil over a lot of what he's saying and you have to kind of put in that extra effort to peel it back to get the full meaning of what he's on about next track the games we play feels incredibly raw and straightforward it's live and direct like like a freestyle over a set of really twangy guitar leads and vintage horn hits one verse after another on this thing about excess extravagance it's pretty much an ode to all things that drug money buys with the vivid verses on this track and push a tease really evocative word choice like the track just feels lawless it feels powerful it feels kind of evil then comes maybe the only real weak moment in the tracklisting hear the song hard piano which features a pretty big eye roll of a line right at the start Rick Ross's feature on this thing is just okay and even though the hook on this thing is epic I feel like the dreamy piano samples and droney scents and super faint percussion just kind of wash into each other in a really bland way just not as much push to this instrumental as I would have liked we then have the infinitely better comeback baby which has this subterranean super civil bassline very minimal drums on this thing - it's so little but it works so perfectly and transitioning from the intro and into the chorus kinda just has these really generous soul samples of George Jackson and the mighty Hannibal taking what sounds like undoctored chunks of their songs and just plopping it into this song in a way it comes off kind of low effort but I won't deny that it is catchy picking these tracks is pretty symbolic as well as both of them deal in addiction reflecting back to push a tease depicted addiction to drug dealing kind of painting this picture of a drug kingpin with a bit of a heart of gold blew through thousands we made millions cocaine soldiers once civilians ba hos Honda's took care children let my pastor build out buildings I also love that white on white tester and black on black Tesla line that was sharp that yin-yang line talking about how real one's bring balance to the game he's in was fantastic - then we have the eerily beautiful Santeria which features these weeping guitar samples ghostly backing instrumentation heavy bass a chilling hook some in Spanish and one nasty beat switch up in the last leg that sounds like just some really sinister funk it's a more forlorn moment on the album as push kind of drops in numerous lyrical references to the recent death of his road manager davon Pickett the track generally just kind of feels like him portraying more of the downsides of this life that he's led ya and pushed me lyrically on the track what would meek do push his references to meek on this track are absolutely perfect talking about having an angel and a devil on his shoulder what would he do then he's portraying himself kind of popping wheelies on the bike and telling the judge okay put it in your mouth Kanye's appearance on the track I guess I'm a little torn on it I mean is it one of his best features no not necessarily it just sort of seems like him trying to stoke more flames in this recent drama that he's been embroiled in it's kind of goofy and off-the-wall and I enjoy that characteristic about it the surrogate child line was interesting the 7 pill Nightline was interesting the beginning pulled over with a Matt a hat line was interesting also talking about how he's showing the scar so so he's he's seal yeah the song infrared is the closure of the album and has probably generated the most conversation around this record given the track is this huge Drake little Wayne Birdman disc with Pusha T saying it was written like nas but it came from Quentin which is a smart line I like Drake's response to the song too but it makes me wonder because Pusha has been throwing bars at Drake for years while this track was really good why respond now and unless what he said really kind of got to you I kind of saw push a tease attack on little Wayne is even more savage than that of Drake which of course could have motivated Drake as well but just portraying Wayne is this guy who's stuck in the industry you can't retire and he has all flash no fires pretty nasty the beat to me didn't really steal the show on this one but it didn't really need to because it really just kind of pushes lines and his viciousness and his monstrous delivery that kind of made the track and overall I mean this thing is a tight little project it's kind of an EP masquerading as an album it's it's a secret EP or maybe a mini album or something but it's so solid it's so watertight I can't really hate on any single moment of it sure the lyrical content the substantive content is nothing really new for Pusha T this is pretty much the stomping grounds he's been inhabiting for years now and quite honestly a record that was longer but consistently of this quality would have made for a better listen but still you just kind of have one great lyrical banger after another just very good writing very good flows very good delivery very good production and I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that upworthy link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantino forever "},{"id":"73Kl42LqEqM","title":"Car Seat Headrest - Teens of Denial ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"y'all have been the wanderer Anthony Fantana how do I find you on twitter I just don't know do I easy answer just look up the word meme I pop right the fuck up the word melon - hi everyone Carthon AC tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new car seat headrests record teens of denial car seat headrest is the musical project masterminded by singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist mr. Will Toledo quickly following up his Matador Records debut last year a teens of style and I'm kind of thinking is this like a sister album of some sort teens of style teens of denial but this new album here seems like a really big change of pace if these albums are related in some kind of conceptual way it's it's not very obvious on the surface because this new record over here seems like such a jump up in ambition right from the crash which is an hour and 11 minutes long across 12 tracks and my issue with that potentially is are these track lengths justified I thought some of the songwriting on the last record was kind of lackluster and I can imagine some of those really forgettable songs stretched out to like 10 or 11 minutes and me just not enjoying them at all plus I was kind of wondering if on their next record car seat headrests really kind of come into their own because will Toledo have for a while now is very boldly been wearing his influences on his sleeve in his music to the point where he drowns in his influences occasionally this album going into it I thought this could either be a really overly long patience testing record that I'm going to hate or the ambitious kick this project needed to keep fans engaged now the sound of the recording here is still kind of low five will is keeping it very close to that bedroom pop and rock aesthetic but this album is noticeably punchier than teens of style the mixes here seem a little more instrumentally dense - with pianos and background vocals and occasional shots of strings or like some horns being added to the bass rock instrumentation and these extra bits of sound elevate the brittle guitars and the really clipping sort of fuzz doubt vocals really nicely the singing is still delivered in this slow lazy kind of boot rub a dictation and it's the kind of thing I think listeners are either gonna love or just totally hate not only because the vocals on this record just sounds so akin to like Julian Casablancas on any given stroke song but also because it does slightly feel like put on however will Toledo does break out of this vocal delivery occasionally on this album to go into his upper register and deliver some crack passionate almost manic singing I am noticing on this record that will is making a bigger effort to deliver some very direct lyrics sort of like on the song Joe gets kicked out of school buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh which is a kind of funny and also sad piece of storytelling from will where he is going through what seems like a really bad high he's paranoid of the police outside he's paranoid of his friends inside occasionally on the record I think the mix is a little aggravating it's almost like the polar opposite issue of what I had with teens of style where a lot of the time the vocals were kind of muffled and thrown into the background just didn't really have that much presence here the vocals really muscled out the instrumentation a lot of the time which kind of just fights chaotically in the background the foundation of the instrumentation is a little quieter than I would like it sometimes except for in the case of the song Vincent where for a great deal of the track there is this horrid a to note guitar line that just just roaring over this kind of funky rock instrumentation that sounds great it's like I'm listening to a 200 dollar guitar alternating between open E and open a with the cheapest sort of built-in distortion that comes out of whatever secondhand amp it's being played out of and I don't know if I mean that yet in the worst way or the best way possible because I actually do like the song here quite a bit and it seems like there's a lot of instrumental chemistry on this record too and I enjoy a lot of wills lyrics on this cut because that is Amira frames are great and this song I think is one of many moments on the record where I think will songwriting has definitely upped itself a notch the structures on these tracks are more ambitious the instrumental breaks and interludes outros intros bridges are better there are actually some super memorable choruses on this record from the noisy and kind of tension building jam at the end of connect the dots to the very awesome and syncopated guitar drum hits on the intro track fill in the blank this album seems so much more focused and again that comes through in the very straightforward lyrics right from the beginning of the album we get this strong narrative of will being angry at people and the world in general kind of invalidating his feelings then we have all these kind of drug narratives coming through on songs like destroyed by hippy powers as well as drunk driving which is not only a track about just drunk driving being a bad idea but the feelings of depression and emptiness that sort of lead will to this point the song just what I needed another track that I really liked on the record from what I've read was actually supposed to incorporate the car song of the same title however he had to rewrite the song will did because the track didn't get cleared and then a bunch of vinyl records that actually had the song printed on it were destroyed but you can still kind of hear the influence of the car song in the very steady mid-paced rhythm guitars on the verses I like the weary vocal delivery on this track which seems very earnest and the funny and smart lyrics on this track too about waiting for some good porn feelings of empty and the whole idea of taking advice though the advice that he is talking about in this tractor seems kind of generic and just not really all that helpful which I think might have been the point of the track on 1937 State Park we see an unhinged will Toledo where he tells a story about being taken down by the cops crying on his way home bottling up all this pain and hiding it from someone because he says his pain is his own and I guess you just won't let it go and the only major issue I have with this record lyrically is probably on the song unforgiving girl where the last portion of the track is dominated by this refrain of it's an unforgiving world but she's not an unforgiving girl but but then in a way will kind of makes up for it on the song cosmic hero with these really heavy one-liners that actually kind of make you think how sad life is where if you want X it comes at the price of why the song also builds into a monstrous instrumental ending that I like a lot we also have toward the back end of this album the 11 minute monster The Ballad of Costa Concordia which is very slow pain ballad with another big ending where we'll kind of delivers these very confessional spoken word vocals where he essentially admits to just not knowing how to navigate life not because he is a totally useless person or anything like that but he's just dealing with a lot of these struggles and issues of just kind of figuring out how to be a mature functioning adult in those late teens and early 20s and it's almost like at the end of this song I'm at the following track - he comes to this conclusion of I just give up and I'm never getting a job you can agree or disagree with the philosophy of the record but it's sort of interesting from the beginning to the end of the album we kind of see this emotional metamorphosis of will we see him move from being worried and neurotic and depressed and feeling empty to this guy who has essentially just dropped all of these hang-ups we have a very serene closing track on the record to sort of end things off on a positive and easygoing note but that's pretty much the end of the album however this hopefully is not the end of will Toledo and his story will continue on to the next record and hopefully it's as interesting to listen to as well written as passionately delivered and as musically engaging as this record over here I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this album transition have you given this car seat headrest record a listen do you love it if you hate it but would you rate it here the best year the best which should i review next hit the light if you like please subscribe please don't die watch more videos share with your mom hope you enjoyed this record car seat headrests teens of denial forever "},{"id":"ySP4iNetZqU","title":"Sun Kil Moon - Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"hey everyone having a bath Denis de pano here the Internet's busiest music nerd lock myself out of my car broke a camera lens couch esta still alive but hey you know we're going to tough it through this video anyway you know what we don't even really gotta tough it through this video because it's it's a very nice album we're talking about here as you can tell it's the new Sun Kil moon record common as light and love our red valleys of blood now Sun Kil moon if you didn't know is a musical project masterminded by singer-songwriter mr. mark kozilek who you might remember from the Red House Painters or the film almost famous or that one song where he told the band the war on drugs to suck his it's it's no secret that the third act of Mark Cossacks musical career has been eventful polarizing some of which seems to stem from his naturally sour and curmudgeon II demeanor though on his last album universal themes it was painfully clear that he was trying to elicit some of these reactions from his actions and his lyrics whether it be through insensitive stage banter or his adversarial stance that he's taken with a lot of the music press for which he's been labeled an asshole a jerk a sexist on the song lone Starr on this very album he talks about being banned or prevented from playing a show in San Antonio because of this sexist label being thrown on him and I don't know if I fully agree with that label I mean mark kozilek is certainly rude maybe his biggest flaw is that he doesn't have a filter but this is simultaneously his greatest strength on this album and this is nothing entirely new at this point for mark I mean this is what people love about records like the recently released Benji an album filled with very sad songs about getting older and mortality laced with tons of personal stories about Marc's life and his youth but then with the next Sun Kil moon record Marc presented a challenge a change of pace getting even more roar in Rambler with his storytelling I couldn't quite tell if the lukewarm reception to this album was due to this being more difficult to digest in comparison with Benji or if it was because of all the enemies across the music world that Marc had made over the past year I wasn't totally crazy about the record personally it felt more meandering than Benji a lot of Marc's diatribes which felt almost stream-of-consciousness a lot of the time lacked conclusion some of the linear groovy instrumentals got stale after a while a couple of them went ultra aggressive with distorted guitars and mark shouting or screaming at the top of his lungs making the lyrics kind of unintelligible but uncommon is why I think this is the album where Marc refines the formula that universal themes was testing again we have songs on this record that are very story centric very narrative heavy but this time around I think Marc's musical monologues have more focus they have more purpose and mark bring some diversity here kind of performing in a mix of singing spoken word and tracks where he's almost rapping the instrumentals I think are more interesting to each track being more patient and linear than the next with a slew of different musical styles crashing into one another whether it be folk music which is painfully clear from all the acoustic guitars and the storytelling indie rock which comes through in a lot of the groovy twangy instrumentals which have a bit of a an early modest mouse flavor to them hip hop which pours through in a lot of the looped and very groovy beats a lot of the beats are instrumentals on this record are heavily centered around the drums and the bass not quite as much electric guitar or acoustic guitar leading the way on some of these cuts and I would say there's almost a post-punk vibe to some of the linear songwriting and raw energy behind these tracks kind of reminds me of a band like the fall now the lyrics on here also have a nice range we tracks that are painfully personal just introspection to the extreme as it seems like Mark delivers every internal thought he ever had throughout 2016 and then to match that we have tracks that are about a wide array of larger more public topics terrorist attacks technology Donald Trump is president that Malaysian flight that went missing and even transgender bathroom rights overall I think this is a more lyrically compelling album a more musically compelling album the only thing that makes this record a challenge is that mark is done with these tracks when he's done with them may take five minutes may take seven minutes may take 12 minutes for him to get off his chest what he needs to get off his chest on a particular track and with there being 16 songs on this record that runtime adds up to over two hours so while I really do enjoy this album as a fan of marks recent work people who are outside the kozilek loop may have a hard time connecting with this thing still though for me personally there are highlights abound on this thing instrumentally on tracks like god bless Ohio which feature a very sad set of descending acoustic guitar chords and a very tight drum beat the instrumental of Philadelphia cop which has more of a hip-hop flavor to it from its drum loops which are very punchy and it's a very deep dark bass line it's like a rap tune but it's a played at a slower jury or your pace I also love the very wintery window sash weights which has some very icy icy guitar chords played throughout then there are other cuts like that steel day and I love Portugal and and vague rock song which seemed intentionally hokey kind of playful a little warmer and of course a lot of these instrumentals they don't just stick to one sound or style throughout there are plenty of tracks that feature acoustic breakdowns or mark either digresses from his many digressions throughout a single song or he gives more detail to what he's singing or talking about on a track or the track chili lemon peanuts almost the entire second half half of that track is this weird spacey ambient passage with these sad keyboards again there's some good instrumental diversity across the record but some important consistencies to the fact that many of the tracks feel very linear feel more like a musical foundation four marks spoken word or story if there's any clear progression across the record it's that as the album moves along it's like mark gets more and more meta with his lyrics the salon 70s TV show theme is so playfully self referential that if I don't know it's uh it's it's unique as Mark is literally rattling off a bunch of TV shows from that decade whose theme songs or incidental music remind him of the very song that he's writing because there is kind of a funky drumbeat and some persistent guitar soloing at some horns that work their way into the track but there is kind of a messy a stream-of-consciousness looseness to the cut that I don't know that doesn't quite remind me of the music from that era lyrical highlights on this song include mark talking about Millennials not potentially getting the references that he's making on this song there's a moment on the track where he says it reminds him of Barney Miller and it wasn't intentional he's just trying to add another track to the album some filler and the song vague rock song is exactly what mark labels it as as he sort of cycles through these nonsensical refrains urging people to sing along with his vague rock song it's kind of a parody of the exact opposite type of tune he wants to write or at least wanted to write for this album he makes a similar point on the track window sash weights we're right after sort of going into this obsession he has with true crimes serial killers Richard Ramirez and this need that's driving him to go to this hotel connected with the unsolved death of ELISA Lam he kind of trails off into these vague rock lyrics before he goes into them he warns us that they're coming and he sort of gives us a bunch of easy to digest refrains to I guess kind of softened the blow from all these weird preoccupations that he has that he sort of went into detail with for a majority of the track mark even visits the hotel he's alluding to on the track Misha premieres and goes even deeper into the ELISA Lam story like I said mark may be really long-winded on this record but for me it's kind of entrancing just how obsessively he sticks to a topic on the song and the more detail he adds to a narrative that he's building on a track the more compelling it becomes what he's saying I'm attract becomes funnier grimmer or even sadder whether on a track it'd be him interacting with college kids on the Sarah Lawrence College song asking them what they're studying how much they're paying a moment where he's reading a letter that he received from the promoter of the show or going to Las Vegas to see a Manny Pacquiao fight that he lost a dead on or a track where he's poking fun at phone obsessed Millennials moment on the same song where he's kind of going through this hilarious satirical conversation telling this a snooty la la la moron that he's a music journalist and she's like oh you got a South by Southwest he goes on to say he knows all the bands he knows a dr. John misty that that's some serious music nerd humor right there also a beautiful moment on the record where he's tributing a friend named butch who passed away this is probably the most detailed tribute he's given anyone on a song as he goes into grave detail about Butch's many habits and personality quirks and marks personal interactions with him at one point mark creates this funny fabricated murder story about this guy who kills a dude because his voice is really similar to Eric Clapton's a moment where he says that in the future when he does a show at Chapel Hill he will invite all transgender people to come in for free and they can use whatever bathroom they want because for him it's about personal dignity and respect he glorifies Portugal as an idyllic getaway from the insanity of the United States of America and on the track Bergen to Trondheim this is an incredibly unlikely but very essential track about the pulse nightclub shooting or at least Marc's reaction and feelings on that this thing is a really odd long and emotionally complicated record but I think it's also very raw and beautiful and personal and thoughtful and move it and super evocative - I love the direction Marc took with the lyrics and took with the instrumentals on this record I love that he didn't give up on some of the ideas that he had on universal themes I think he improved on them greatly and while I don't think this record is is widely accessible as Benji I think in many respects it's every bit as good I think what Mark has done here is pulled together a boldly different and refreshing reinvention sure there are a few points on the record where I think a point that Mark is trying to make or a joke that he's trying to make has gone on a little long or worn it's welcome or mark gets so meta on this record that it's hard not to roll your eyes at what he's doing at least a little bit sort of like how when Mark is singing about how his back catalog is on amazon.com because this particular person who he's referencing said that he likes his older song but again as I said earlier this is really the strength of this album mark is just breaking the fourth wall so hard that he's made a really unique listening experience in the process and not just lyrically because you know the stories on this thing are supremely detailed they're supremely intense they're supremely engrossing but I think the album is musically interesting too I think mark does a lot of cool things fusing these elements of hip-hop music of rock music of folk music into this linear and winding mix I just have to give it to mark cause like again because deep into his career again he's coming out with an incredibly challenging adventurous and inventive album I'm feeling a light to ds9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you radio the best you the best which should I review next hit the like if you like please drive please don't cry leave an angry comment if you're angry and links next to my head now you should check out other videos and subscribe to the channel fish a website you're the best some kill moon common adds light forever "},{"id":"JGeLYl3kkmg","title":"St. Vincent- Strange Mercy ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"st.

Vincent's music so good it's kind of turned into this odd mutant beauty now pretty much all of these tracks function on a verse chorus verse thing it's an artsy pop album but there's like equal attention paid toward making these songs catchy and also making them kind of surprising take the the biggest single to come from this LP cruel the track just opens up with these gorgeous string arrangements like closing credits at the end of the Disney movie gorgeous it sounds like a fairy tale with a fantastic beat but there's this really dark undertone to the song with the lyrics and and not only that but the the solo the guitar solo in this it's so ugly and distorted and just like broken sounding it's this intentional blemish on this really pretty song that song and the rest of the songs on here are just so like two-faced they're really to get into but they'll turn right around and just sort of like fly a freak flag I think my favorite song on here though is dilettante and that song might be my favorite just because of how how weird it feels the drums are like stumbling they're stuttering like they're they're trying to get going but they can they're moving at this this slow pace and I'm just like on the edge of my seat waiting for them to go faster waiting for them to do something but yet they just hang back here and they play so sparsely and then all of a sudden just this this rush of distorted guitar and bass and piano just all hitting Keys syncopated at once it's poppy and it's sweet but yet again it's like so harsh and abrasive it's like something I'd hear a grinder man record or like a Tom Waits record I mean thrown all these really noisy elements these glitchy electronics - especially on the fifth track Northern Lights which I love it just feels like really liberating to me things don't have to be just pretty or just harsh and abrasive they can be both now this LP swings over to the softer side of things as well but it stays really alluring and it stays pretty weird - the title track I love the title track on here it's just really stark and cold and kind of painful surgeon has a really weird synthesizer landscape hanging in the background and I love how kind of robotic and mesmerizing the hook is on that track of the weird guitar leads and it just they're morbid lyrics on this track about being cut open and that's one of the many darker lyrical moments that will buzz by you if you're just wrapped up in the music which I can understand because there's a lot going on musically on this album a lot of layers a lot of subtleties a lot of things you're going to pick up with multiple listens but lyrics like convinced it was the end of times and and sharks swimming in the red no matter what kind of flavor or sound that a song is going for on this album that dark outlook is is one of the few strings that run through all the tracks I thought actor was we colorful album but this thing brings out way more color and not only that but the songs on here feel a little more polarized in that the more depressing moments are more depressing and the brighter louder noisier moments come off even more bold and that's a word I have to kind of bring it back to bold I would use that word to sum up a description of this album it is pretty bold it's got some very strong instrumentation surrounding these tracks it's got some strong vocals in a time when really light weak singers with not that much range are praised left and right in the indie community my only real gripe with this LP is there's a handful of tracks that do not come off as flamboyant or adventurous to me like the track neutered fruit it's a fine song but it kind of ends up sounding like a more pleasant version of a track from Dirty Projectors bit of Orca that aside from a few tracks that I just think are ok I can't say much negative about this album it pretty much does a perfect tightrope walk of being experimental and catchy it was really easy to get into and yet I don't feel like I'm listening to something sugary dumbed down or simple and most importantly it was just fun to listen to I think even coucher chesta had it had a fun time I can't really see much I'm at I'm not religious well there you go feeling a light to decent ate on this loved it thought it was really good I recommend it which is why I'm making a video doing that what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana st. Vincent strange mercy forever [Music] [Music] "},{"id":"XxbkE90hv38","title":"White Suns- Sinews ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"you are just laying there you've been laying there for a while well I'm gonna do something about it hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's white son's sinews white Sons is a Brooklyn mouth noise punk trio and this is their sophomore LP it's out now on load records it's six tracks lasts around 30 minutes and despite the brevity it is a very intense listen now despite this being noise rock noise punk it's not really your very rockin with heavy catchy blood pumping side of this style of music white Sons is much more heavy much more artsy not really looking to rock you but instead perform brain surgery on on anyone willing to listen to their music through the ear canals with tons of ear piercing guitar feedback improvised drums and some very disturbing abstract lyrics if I had to boil this album down to a phrase it's kind of like a really raw chaotic noise rock poetry slam and for a three-piece that is guitar bass they come up with some pretty interesting sounds there are lots of low-end drones feedback that flies into various pitches there are some sounds that I'm not even sure how these guys are even making them to be honest like I'm a song see know where there's this guitar kind of hanging in the left channel that's lame it kind of brought me back to the first time I heard Health another noise rock band that is much catch here than white Suns by comparison but I was pretty perplexed by a lot of the sounds they were producing too either I am perplexed by the sounds of a given track or I am just so in love infatuated with how jagged and how angular some of the songs these guys write are right right the opener of this album fire sermon just burns and in Sears with all these layers of feedback that are constantly changing the track even though it is not really putting forth any real constant drum beats or a groove or a rhythm of pattern or anything it just stays so tense and the song eventually explodes into this flurry of a very tight blazing drums and quickly strum guitars whose chords I think are like the key of Z the next track has these floor tom drum rolls that I love that are constantly speeding up or slowing down and there are these very twittering guitar noises that make me think of like metal hitting glass or like a swarm of spiders heading toward me or something it creeps me I'm just thinking about it the track footprints fill the third song on here is easily the most Rocking on this entire thing it just has these relentless syncopated drum and guitar chords hitting together over and over and over and over it is like getting bashed over the head with a hammer until your skull caves in one thing I do think is is kind of exceptional about this record is the band is always changing the shapes of its riffs or they're building a song up they're winding it down there's always some kind of shift going on they're basically saying hey you know what true traditional song structures screw courses and refrains we don't want any of that but even though these guys are really working hard to to be outside of that that structure they do organize their songs white Suns really places all of its ducks in a row on a lot of these tracks with some very clear and impressive transitions linking one section of a track to another I like the feeling of intensity why suns has that but I also like the feeling of progression of going somewhere and white Suns has that his well however I'm not saying this album is going to be a walk in the park it may not necessarily click the first time around it didn't with me but the sounds were so interesting that that I continued being intrigued and wanting to return to this album because I've been listening to it on and off for a little bit so though it may not all appear in a really obvious way at first there is a method to the madness of these songs and if you want to talk about madness the vocals on this album are pretty maniacal pretty twisted now I can't really say hey on this track the vocal delivery was was especially Minaya no I can't say that because that's the case with every single track here I do wish the vocals did present a little bit more variety either you're hearing these these really extreme ragged screams or a very kind of deadpan narration but despite the fact that I may have wanted a little bit more these two you know styles do match what's going on with this album very well the song temple picks things up with this really kind of slow crushing groove yeah I kind of imagine in my head that this is what it's like to be very slowly eaten alive by something that is around two or three times your size with these giant metallic guitar cort teeth crushing down on you with every bite the closer is great to with with these very kind of primal drum beats that to me just stopping and starting and stopping and starting and then eventually it just kind of all ends as the big fat noisy broken sounding bill kind of clang even though it is noise rock music and sounds very modern there's something so kind of ritualistic and ancient about this particular track I did come at this thing with a few gripes I do feel like the production the recording on this thing could have been better could have added to the intensity of the sound um a lot I do think white Suns is sounding better than ever their production that recording is definitely of a higher quality in comparison with their first album the sounds are definitely brighter more resident bolder but the vocals were a little more distanced that I would have liked him to be the drums were much more distanced than I would have liked them to be they kind of sounded like they were recorded with two or even one microphone placed far away from the drums just with a lot of ambient noise and everything but the guitars felt so close this album just has an incredibly dark and sick energy to it that I love that I think has made a lot of the the best noise rock records out there great I'm not necessarily saying this is one for the history books but this was definitely an incredibly solid listen with some great songs that I'm going to remember by the end of this year and a nice little detour a nice noisy detour for me in my listening trajectory kind of feel a little strong 7 - a light 8 on this thing what did you guys think of it if you've heard this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next forever "},{"id":"Uge_eyjwPYw","title":"Weezer - Everything Will Be Alright In The End ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"ah hi everyone Anton Fantin here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Weezer album everything will be all right in the end famed alternative rock and power pop band Weezer on their ninth full-length album here Wow their first album came out in 1994 it's on my favorite pop rock albums of all time it's essentially been 20 years since the release of that record amazing singles on this album clever sort of fun humorous nerd friendly Tunes but as great as this album was to me in the grander scheme of things it doesn't really feel like anything more in the career of Weezer than just a moment in time because now with the band being as old as they are there's a lot of history Weezer hit an artistic and a commercial stride with the Blue Album with Pinkerton but then more radio-friendly songs began to come down the pipe with albums like the green album but the grown worthy material didn't really dropping until records like maple leaf or the red album or attitude where we were getting singles like Beverly Hills and we're all on drugs songs that are so far outside the rubric of why you originally loved the band it's kind of hard not to at least feel just a little bit of a sense of betrayal and when fans feel that way it's a little hard to kind of win them back it's like you've almost soured the relationship plus I think a lot of fans were anticipating that Weezer would kind of aged and mature along with them as they grew up but instead Weezer decided to kind of stay in this musical Neverland where they would essentially stay sixteen years old musically and lyrically for the rest of time so despite this lack of progression and maybe even a tiny embrace of regression on a few records I actually did end up enjoying Weezer's last album quite a bit early for me this record was relatively low on BS it just had a lot of good catchy straightforward pop rock songs and the typical Weezer style but another thing this album signaled to me is that Ouiser is going to pander less to the radio rock market because we've got the internet now where everything has a niche and maybe if we're lucky will we not only get some better songs from Weezer but maybe even just a little bit of acknowledgment of the years of disappointment felt by people whose adolescence was defined by songs like El Scorcho and the sweater song as well as Buddy Holly and Weezer actually does that here they make the effort they do it to the best of their abilities I will not go as far as to say Weezer has matured on this record but they have put out their most ambitious album in a while here and in addition to that this is their most self-aware record in well over a decade musically Weezer is putting together songs in typical Weezer fashion with that same guitar tone super heavy super thick the mid-paced riffs rivers Cuomo's vocals still have a somewhat whiny tone to them but still very enjoyable the bass is basically there just to thicken things up the drums are nice with Weezer it's not really the magic of any individual part really it's more about how all the instrumentation comes together to complement the song and there are some songwriting triumphs on this record like eulogy for a rock band a song that embraces a theme on this record that rock and Weezer are both kind of past their prime maybe pass their peak of relevancy and if that is in fact the case then this song is a very punchy fun catchy and kind of a tear-jerking goodbye super melodic chorus way catchy lyrics on the chorus as well and poetically I think it kind of puts the rock band to bed quite nicely and I love the song had it up to here which starts off with this really funky guitar riff it's got a great groove but then when the verse comes in I think the theme of this song really hits home with river singing that I'm trying to give you my best artistically I'm trying to give you my best material but you've essentially plugged up your ears at this point which for a lot of Weezer fans is totally 100% true and you know the the frustration rivers is is very mutual but not on this I love how lyrically he's diving into a lot of the critiques that people have thrown a tweezer over the years and maybe he's acknowledging them a little bit the lack of edge the mediocrity the homogeneous Asian he's saying what a lot of people have been saying and he puts it into a very nicely packaged song but is he only saying what sort of maybe longtime Weezer fans or X Weezer fans have been wanting to hear because it's not like this album isn't without its mediocre moments you have lonely girl like you you were just singing about mediocrity and then you put out this song lonely girl which maybe has some of the most insipid lyrics of any Weezer song not just that but the song is just way too cliche to handle and even further on the cliche scale is the male/female duet on the song go away again you were just singing about mediocrity and you're doing a song here that sounds like a really terrible chien hem tune we have a lead single from this LP back to the shack which instrumentally is a pretty catchy tune but lyrically I'm not really sure I'm that into the concept we have river singing about hey you know let's get out of this crappy singing show stuff and instead get back to what we do best and what we're familiar with them when we know is great and what we know the fans want get back to the shack do the writing do the rocking just be Weezer and in this song lyrically we have river singing about going hardcore like it's 94 when in fact this song does not sound like 94 Weezer it sounds like 2001 Weezer anybody who's a Weezer fan knows that and while in concept I do agree with the the jabot stupid singing shows the alternative that Weezer is bringing to the table here is really only like a lesser of two evils it's not like oh my god this is what I should be doing instead and the opening track on here to over 20 years as a band and Weezer is still singing about that feel when no girlfriend not just that but this song is also an example of how atrocious the production can get on this record the song kicks off with this overly loud bass e and compressed guitar riff that is just so boom and so crushing like what are you trying to prove you don't got to go super heavy just to impress us and besides when the guitars get this loud which they do occasionally you can't even really make out the vocals that well so yeah the the years of musical abuse I have had my heart turned a little cold when it comes to Weezer however there are still moments on this record where they get to me like on the song the British are coming which is a little overly simplified as far as the history behind the song but it's still a little fun left hook patriotism pop rock tune which I didn't see coming then there's the song da Vinci which I think has one of Weezer's best hooks in years on it and I like the lyrical concept of this song saying that this person that maybe a love interest is very hard to describe their abstract they're different they just have no precedent they're hard to put into words saying that not even da Vinci could paint this person not even Stephen Hawking could explain this person we've got Cleopatra which to me sticks out as a unique tune just because of how oddly shaped and grooved the lead melody is on the chorus really weird hook it feels almost as if like the drums and the guitars bust in maybe like a beat early and it's a bit of a surprise like on the British are coming we also have a bit of a nod to history on this song but the concept of this track really lies in aging and just growing older and growing colder emotionally which maybe runs parallel to the whole Weezer rock fan dynamic going on right now that's mentioned on a few tracks here there's the song foolish father where we kind of see rivers very well-documented daddy issues kind of playing out into a sequel song here where maybe he's reflecting a little bit on the fact that he is a father now and has to kind of work through these difficulties at a different angle and once again the song is incredibly catchy straightforward sweet that classic Weezer formula at work once again in this track like many other songs on here work through the themes set out by the title of this album that I guess everything will work out when it's all over and the record itself definitely does that it resolves really well with this trio of songs that are filled with soaring guitar harmonies it's a really grand epic and ambitious finish for this record for Weezer in general maybe some of you might be thinking this trio of tracks was trying a little too hard but I personally like the fact that Weezer seems to be trying at all it really feels like they're putting an effort into these songs and again while this record may not exactly be mature Weezer at least tries to build a bridge to a lot of their older fans saying hey listen we hear you and we know the issue and we know the problem and essentially we're just like a little sorry for it and it's it's nice to hear that but only sometimes does it feel like Weezer is actually working to fix these issues and as a result as much as I like a lot of the tracks here it's sort of hard to be totally gung-ho about this record because of the disappointing moments I'm peeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition though I guess I did totally end up digging a lot of this record yeah you know it's it's a likable album it's a good album I just uh you know it's it's it's just uh it's just hard not to at least be just a touch disappointed because of just how high the high-water marks were at least for me anyway earlier on in Weezer's career but that's it you know it feels like a throwback album a little bit but again it's very much a throwback to like the early 2000s Weezer not the 90s Weezer cool cool have you given this album we'll listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and um and that's it Anthony Fantana Weezer forever "},{"id":"iXiIx4DKKbs","title":"Keiji Haino + Sumac - American Dollar Bill ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone cool today cool tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sumac n kg hi no album American dollar bill you keep pacing sideways you're too hideous to look at face on this is a new collaborative album featuring two names in the worlds of heavy and experimental music one sumac contemporary sludge metal band spearheaded by guitarist songwriter Aaron Turner of Isis old man gloom gray Machine Fame and then you also have catchy Heino prolific Japanese experimental music artist I don't really know what made these two worlds collide honestly but seeing them come together was truly enough to pique my interest personally I've never been a super-huge Isis and Aaron Turner guy though I have you know shown my respect to the band before they are a good band I get why they have fans I get the appeal it just hasn't really appealed to me personally and sumac every album so far has just been kind of man to me but still seeing them come together with an artist like hi no to me says whoa this could be a moment that really kind of adds the eccentric weird elements to their music that I kind of always wished were there and in a way that's kind of what this record brings I mean this album is over an hour of heavy noisy abrasive freewheeling improvisational noise metal the album here features five tracks whose song titles are about as difficult to digest as the music itself for example we have parts 1 & 2 of what have I done I was reeling in something white and I became able to do anything I made a whole imprisoned time within it created friction stopped listening to warnings ceased fixing my errors made the impossible possible turned sadness into joy I don't I don't know there's also parts 1 & 2 of I'm over 137 percent a love junkie and it's still not enough the pieces on this album they're winding they're tense their explosive sometimes feeling a little disjointed disconnected kind of obtuse all over this record there's this really dramatic drum playing which is kind of exploring the space between these seemingly improvised guitar passages hi know also provides these really aggressive strange vocal freak-outs a lot of it's pretty harrowing a lot of it's pretty massive bone-crushing riffs and and noise and distortion but despite a lot of this record feeling at least a little off-the-cuff there is a surprising amount of chemistry between the band and hi know here sumac really seems to provide a lot of the rhythmic and sonic muscle on the record that kind of allows Heino to color on top of that with his voice and just some really angular strange guitar work now while I enjoy this record a lot and I think it's great I like the performances I like how rod is and it's certainly the most interesting thing I think either these artists have been affiliated with in a long time but I guess the novelty of this record did wear off on me a little bit as I came back to it for repeated listens because it's it's not quite as experimental and it's not quite as an orthodox as maybe I would have liked because there's certainly a lot of similarities one could draw two other artists from this record that are on the noisier side of things bands like Indian or swans or Boris though I guess it is kind of interesting to hear a singular piece of music that can draw those kinds of comparisons and while I do think sumac and hi knows strike a good balance between just very spacious tense patience testing passages and more visceral moments on the album the more I listen to it the more I really wanted from it more versatility more experimentation more sonic adventure more compositional risks more intense highs as well because after a while some of the noisier and more long-winded spots on the album might just kind of grew numb to them I'm not trying to knock this album though it's still easily one of the better experimental rock releases you're gonna hear this year and if you are on the weirder side of the spectrum when it comes to rock music if that's kind of where you like to hang out you do not want this to slip by you I promise you I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen

"},{"id":"mxMQEy8sQJI","title":"Cardi B - Invasion of Privacy ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"Hi everyone, Anthony Fantano here, internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Cardi B album \"Invasion Of Privacy\". Straight out of the Bronx it's Cardi B, reality star, internet and social media icon, rapper. Cardi's rise to mainstream fame in the past year has been meteoric to say the least. Her stripper to rap superstar transition has been explosive, and pretty much unparalleled. Her breakout single \"Bodak Yellow\" gained momentum very slowly over the course of the summer of 2017 and beyond, and she has dropped numerous chart toppers since. And her new record over here went gold the day of release. She has pretty much outlasted all claims that she is just a one hit wonder, and that her fifteen minutes of fame are almost up, and believe it or not, \"Invasion Of Privacy\" is actually not that bad. I mean I'm not going to say it's amazing or anything, but it's just good enough to where it would stave off claims that she's fallen off or that she doesn't have any long game. Because over all this thing is pretty consistent and even the spots that I don't care for will most likely go over well with her fans. But first let me try to get into the appeal of Cardi B. Obviously Cardi's music isn't particularly smart or flashy or experimental or whatever and most likely every track on this record is heavily reliant on Cardi's co-songwriters as well as her producers. With all of that being said, Cardi represents more than your average pop, trap, or soundcloud rapper right now. Because on this record she is an authoritative, sexually empowered, woman with this rag to riches story that nearly every American dreams of. Which in a way I think hits harder than it does for a lot of other artists out there because Cardi's past in dancing, in television, in these kind of shoddy mix tapes that she was dropping a little while back, has all been so well documented online. Because before Cardi blew up in the music industry, most people online already knew about her as just being this funny, goofy, silly, social media personality that nobody really needed to take that seriously. But since \"Bodak Yellow\" and the release of this album it's all of a sudden like 'Woah, you've really like glowed up'. Another thing that adds to the appeal of Cardi is that her rough and unfiltered personality is so magnetic. I mean, the lyrics on this album range from being hilarious to being brash to being vulnerable. Even a little edgy with the multiple allusions to gang culture and specifically the bloods on this thing. I mean this album cover isn't red or anything but still the content within is about as bloodied up as YG's \"Still Brazy\". And generally Cardi B just seems way less calculated than a lot of other artists who manage to hit the mainstream, typically as a result of working at it for years and years and years and going through this very slow and very measured grooming process. Not that Cardi hasn't been working in the industry or trying to make her way up for a long time, she has, but in the areas of social media and reality television it's the exact opposite of reserved and calculated that gets you views and gets you attention. Given that background, given that experience it very much paints her approach to music and paints her approach to I guess just showcasing herself in the public eye. And I make that point not just as Cardi B as a female artist but I feel like generally male artists are a bit more I guess calculated as well. So this thing is thirteen tracks, its forty minutes I very much appreciate that for a debut it does not overstay its welcome. And it pretty much seems like the name of the game on this track list is to pen as many bangers and highlights as possible. This thing kicks off with the track \"Get Up 10\" which is a dramatic makeover anthem with a lot of lyrics about where Cardi came from, where she is now the track shows a lot of heart for her roots and her family but also a lot of New York grit. And I just kind of love that ending refrain where she talks about getting knocked down nine times but then getting up ten, it really kind of says a lot about Cardi as an artist and basically the theme of this album in general. That will for Cardi to push and succeed, move forward. However, it does't take too long for this record to just totally go off the rails and get insane. And what I mean is the song \"Bickenhead\" which is the most bad bitch anthem I've ever heard in my entire life. Cardi's sense of humor and charisma on this track are incredible, this track in a lot of ways is about the power the power of sex. Every bar on this track is about something sexual, just straight fucking she really kind of takes rapping about pussy popping to a new level. Pussy popping at church, pussy popping on the stove. I'm having a hard time talking right now because I had a near heart attack thinking about the line where she's talking about making that pussy crack a smile. Yeah, that's that's not something you hear every day. And moments like this are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the unrefined extravagance and exaggeration that Cardi brings to this album. Whether she's rapping about a Versace driveway or putting a Louis Vuitton shoe on some trash talking girl's neck. She's rapping about a threesome with Rhianna. Pussy so good she screams her own name. Also calling herself hot 'n ready like a Little Cesear's pizza. I hope you got a check for that. And also like Cardi is just the queen of shit talking on this record like this one bar about how this girl is saying that you know everything down there it's all her, it's all hers, but then she brings up that her thighs don't match, like they're different sizes, they don't look the same. *melon inhales sharply* ouch I also love this one bar where she says some guy is a pussy and a rat like Tom and Jerry. On a lot of these tracks, self written or not, it just feels like Cardi is putting on a masterclass in the hard-hitting, just totally no apologies, no shame, no holds barred verbal nastiness that New Yorkers are known for. The song \"Bodak Yellow\" is obviously in the track listing on this thing, what else can I say about this track that hasn't been said a million times before. It's easily one of the most cold and deadly trap bangers of the decade. And sure, while instrumentally the production on this thing might just be trap 101 and Cardi's flow on this track may just be an interpolation of a Kodak Black flow, but Cardi, with her personality, really sells the track. I mean a lot of new contemporary pop rap and trap right now it's all about personality, it's all about presence it's a personality contest and Cardi, if it's gonna be a competition on a personality level she brings that just *melon yells* When it comes to personality, when it comes to accent, when it comes to recognizability she just like goes super [saying?] And something that makes that work in my opinion is just that a lot of Cardi's rapping feels like she's kind of inviting her fans in on celebrating her success with her, as opposed to just trying to blow out everyone within ear and eye shot regardless of whether or not they're a fan which is especially true on the track \"Best Life\". which is a moment where Chance The Rapper really steals the show. His melodic very uppity very animated flow is here in spades. *melon sings* I'm living my best life and you know that vocal line is incredible, but Cardi certainly holds her own on the track. She is very different in terms of style and performance and delivery than Chance is and you know again just that kind of gritty, nasty, unfiltered New York personality just kind of pours through here, but there's a nice sense of positivity to this track that I feel like was much needed at the middle point of this thing. The song \"Be Careful\" believe it or not has grown on me since I initially heard it and had kind of a negative reaction to it. And Cardi's transition into a more emotional angle on this track, it's a bit awkward. But in a way, with Cardi B, her imperfections are kind of her strengths. Which is something that she even seems to be self aware of as she brings up her crib being messy, her hair being fucked up, or having messed up teeth which she later got fixed but there was a long period of time where her teeth were not in the best shape. But to even reference that in her own music so many times kind of continues, maybe inadvertently, this theme of self improvement and just kind of continuing to work on yourself so that you can be that best person you can be, you can kind of also be on that Cardi B track to success. Now unfortunately, after the middle point of this album, the quality kind of trails off a little bit. One, because some of the guests are a little underwhelming and two, because at this point Cardi B is still not that versatile of a rapper. The song \"I Like It\" is this latin trap flip featuring a prominent sample of the song \"I Like It Like That\" I think The Blackout Allstars version of the track, I could be wrong, could be the original at least that's the version I remember from when I was a kid. As far as Cardi's flow, her lyrics, and the instrumental goes, the track goes over great. Bad Bunny on the track is pretty fine even though I'm not really a huge fan of some of the latin trap crooners that have been making the rounds recently. What's for sure is he has more personality than J Balvin, who in my opinion really kind of just extends the track out a little bit too much, like his addition to the song was really unnecessary. Though I get given Cardi's background and the flavor of the song you would want to try to invite as many relevant people to that sound as possible to a track like this, it's all marketing. It's certainly better than it could've been. Balvin just seemed unnecessary because his vocals in my opinion, not that distinct, and Bad Bunny already outshined him on the track. The song \"Ring\" with Kehlani, I just do not care for Kehlani's vocals on this track at all they sound super sanitized, generic, dime a dozen, I wouldn't even know it was Kehlani if you didn't tell me. \"Money Bag\" is maybe the most unnecessary track on the entire record. Not only because the production is some of the most basic on the entire project, the hook is incredibly annoying, and on top of that Cardi's flow on here is pretty much just a repeat of her flow from \"Bodak Yellow\". It's like her and her producers were essentially trying to you know, go for \"Bodak Yellow\" number two. But making their attempts at just repeating the same formula a little too obvious. In my opinion, \"Bartier Cardi\" is a much better attempt at trying to get another weird, dark, trap hit brewing, which obviously worked because this song went number one as well, but in their attempts to make this happen it wasn't that obvious, it's not like they were literally copying and pasting the formula onto another song. SZA totally kills it on the closer. Her vocals are fantastic, some of the most aggressive and animated I've heard her on any track ever, but as far as a closing track this song to me really doesn't work all that well. This track thematically I think could have fit into numerous points of the album and it would've sounded just the same. Not to mention at this point on the album Cardi's delivery and flow, even though she does have some of her funniest lines on this song is kind of running a little thin for me, like she could use a bit of a change up at this point. \"Drip\" with Migos in my opinion is really weighed down by the Migos themselves as this performance here seems just as average as nearly every other performance they seem to give, on most features and most albums that they appear on these days. And then when it comes to the track \"She Bad\" with YG, easily one of the most tedious hooks on the entire record. I wish YG had like a more prominent or interesting feature on this thing, more interesting than *melon sings* she bad, she bad, she bad, she bad Louis bag, Louis bag, Fendi bag, Fendi bag *sings gibberish* Really the best moment on the back end of this record in my opinion is the song \"Thru Your Phone\" featuring Ali Tamposi, whose name I hope I'm pronouncing correctly, I apologize if I'm not but she's singing along with Cardi on the hook of this track and it's easily one of the best guest vocals on the entire record. I wish she had a credit right there on the title because her voice has this kind of very dreamy, pillowy, sad, moody demeanor that makes the song go over so well because Cardi's voice she's a little bit like a bull in a china shop. It's hard for her to convey super emotional tracks really well sometimes. And this track in particular was one of the more interesting when it comes to relationships on the rocks and this bitterness, this sense of betrayal that she feels. But this track is still one of the more interesting on the entire record when it comes to love on the rocks. It's not like be careful with me, that's a little bit more, I guess introspective with Cardi rapping about feeling insecure, feeling a lot of self doubt because the other person in the relationship isn't treating her right. This track \"Thru Your Phone\" is a little bit more nasty and bitter, a track where she's seeking vengeance over the fact that this person has just thrown her trust out of the window through their infidelity on their phone. Even though this album was a little bit of a mixed bag, it's not that bad of a commercial debut, it's a decent first outing. And like I said the tracks I didn't care for too much will most likely go over well with Cardi's fans but still with what she's presented here, I kind of feel like, I don't know, maybe down the road she could get a bit more interesting, maybe she could kind of work out some of these kinks and become a better rapper. I'm feeling a decent to strong six on this record. Tran- sition, have you given this album a listen? Did you love it, did you hate it? What would you rate it?

Hampton album saturation 3 West Coast rap outfit merillia boy band Brock Hampton they're back the whole gang is back Calvin amen Marlin the guy Mathew Timbaland no really these guys have a lot of members just just just let's just look just look just look at the personnel this is the third record they've released this year this is the final installment in what essentially they have dubbed the saturation series the group essentially tried to saturate the scene with so much music that they would be nearly impossible to ignore whose successful experiment I'd say because they delivered fans approximately 50 tracks over two hours of material they really blew my mind on the first installment saturation one with one banger after another with just as much color in the production as there was coming out of the members each with their own individual little voice and personality and lyrical style of course there were some very obvious influences coming through on saturation 1 and saturation to Kanye West's nerd clips as well boy bands and mainstream pop of course odd future Wolf Gang kill them all a little Mac Miller as well all of these influences really kind of worn on the group's sleeve however their great execution and their good song writing quality to me always overshadowed any obvious influence coming out of their Tunes and honestly I've just been in awe of the group's consistency thus far especially considering how much material they've been dropping in such a short amount of time now one major complaint I had with saturation 2 is that it kind of just sounded like more of the same I mean I do love saturation 1 so I guess that's not a huge problem and I think saturation 2 has grown on me a bit since my original review because it kind of makes up for its lack of surprises and experimentation with some very bold hooks and a very tight tracklist going into saturation 3 though I still hoped that Brock Hampton would kind of find a way to pull out all the stops and it definitely seemed like that was going to be the case with the teaser track to this thing Boogie goddamn this track was their most insane single by far by far the police sirens the buzzing bassline the squawking horns Laden into this thing the dance beat the dense vocal overdubs there's a lot going on here like it's it's really a lot to take in and on top of that you have each member trading these really aggressive amped energy filled mini verses Joba especially standing out more than he usually does with one of his yell piest appearances on any Brockhampton release ever I wouldn't say there's a whole ton of lyrical substance to this track but it certainly makes up for it with its intense and immense amount of kinetic energy so was my mouth watering after I heard this track yeah yes it definitely was even though in the back of my head I was kind of afraid that this would end up being just more of the same the sequel and it does feel like that in pockets of course on this thing you have a forlorn one-minute track thrown into the mix a few spoken word passages of course performed by Roberto not to mention you're gonna hear something on this album I would like to call the Brockhampton flow especially from Amir on numerous tracks [Music] so yeah that does that does come up a lot keep in mind though Amir is not the only person in Brock Hampton who has used or uses this flow so and there are a few other moments on this thing I kind of saw coming from a mile away like the closing track team which is yet another shimmering reverb heavy guitar ballad to close the album out featuring bare face on lead vocals which to me as an ending is nowhere near as satisfying as previous endings to saturation 1 & 2 waste and summer but the huge and shoegazing rush of guitar chords in the second leg of this first portion of the song are kind of a nice payoff kind of orgasmic and points for the beats which up in the middle of the track which leads to an unexpected set of rap verses also that one line at this moment in the track talking about how you thought your world was progressive because you had a black president that hit hard and stains in my opinion it's kind of one of the group's most average tracks it's it's a very by-the-numbers moment for Brock Hampton in my opinion there's nothing really all that sticky about it from Matt and Aamir's very glazed-over flows to the somewhat sleepy beat which relies heavily on these kind of low-budget synth horns that kind of have a Tyler the Creator quality to him I do like the vocal harmonies and the beats which up toward the end of the song though and that's another thing there are more beats which ups on this project then I had anticipated certainly more than there's been on saturation 1 & 2 which is good that was actually something I hope Brock Hampton would experiment with a little bit more it also happens on the last moments of Alaska the last moments of bleach on the song sister nation which is easily one of the weirdest songs Brock Hampton has ever recorded period the first portion of the tracks sister features these punky driving beats very jagged angular bass lines some weird psychedelic shots of horns pitch vocals as well it sounds like I don't know some kind of wacko land version of Death Grips I love Matt champions fiery flow on this tracks of the screaming sputtering synthesizers also a really unsettling intro verse about coming off of mood stabilizers and becoming violent and tagged at the end of this track is like a weird space rap dream sequence I wish it wasn't so washed out and reverb but some of the heavenly background vocals are actually very nice now hottie is kind of a weird moment for the group easily one of their Poppaea Strax yet to the point where it doesn't really feel that much like a rap song at all especially with pretty much every verse on this thing emphasizing melody more than actual flow or lyricism the song rental is one of the catchiest and sweetest songs on the album - with a pretty cool combination of sounds that feel like they're coming from like 80's electro funk 90s R&B and contemporary rap and as long as i mentioning sweeter spots on the album I have to mention bleach which features these hauntingly beautiful odd like mutant angel vocal harmonies some very sad and vulnerable rap verses it's just one of those many introspective moments the group pulls off so well especially with do you make mistakes or do you make a change the feel to mention a few bangers the song zipper goes into supremely odd in unexpected direction with its schmaltzy horn and piano samples it's very uppity dance beat and zany singing it sounds a lot like I don't know Marshall Mathers LP era Slim Shady like it's on some real Slim Shady shit with like a dash of Outkast it was kind of a turn-off like a weird combination of sounds and flavors at first but as I listened to it more and more I just kind of grew to love it oh yeah and Merlyn says my fucking name on this track which I'm pretty sure is like an invite to join I'm gonna I'm gonna join Brock Hampton Oh for real can I join too no no no I'm the one with the mixtape I got the mixtape you never did a mixtape I don't care the song Johnny features some neat jittery beats and some smooth jazzy samples our guitar chords as well with each member of the group trading verses over this thing that to me I'm getting a lot of themes of growing up having a hard time adjusting to the world neurotic feelings anxiety having a hard time living up to the maturity level expected of you and again there's kind of a wild little hook on this track that to me reads as more outcasts influence and the last major banger that I have to mention on this thing is stupid which is groovy hypnotic features these very plinky synth chords like these wailing synth leads that to me read as more g-funk influence which I caught pretty prominently on their last saturation project a heavy bass line and this mantra hook that just sticks in my head boys wanna play with myself I know I know buddy see what's in it overall I really like this project as far as the quality of these tracks goes it's just as high as nearly every piece of the saturation series thus far productions their hooks are their verses are their vocal performances are their there are a few predictable moments here and there on this thing for sure mostly because I think Brock Hampton has consciously tried to stick to a formula and a style for the saturation series however they changed it up pretty adequately for this last installment especially from an instrumental and a musical style standpoint because in a lot of ways saturation 3 is the papas but also most unorthodox installment in the trilogy but I do wish things changed up a little bit more lyrically though I'm catching a lot of the same themes that I already have on saturation 1 & 2 especially in regards to sexuality feeling like an outcast in society dealing with emotional problems is just this general sense of millennial angst still though this was a pretty great ending to this 3 album series and will remain to me is one of the most iconic moments in rap for this decade where you had this group who just blew up and just made this amazing run of Records in a very short span of time it was also really nice to hear some members who have previously been a bit more obscured on previous saturations a bit more prominently on this one and at this point I think it's pretty safe to say that Brock Hampton is not going anywhere anytime soon they've really established themselves as a figure in the hip-hop scene right now and this record really assured me that their creativity and versatility it's real and it's certainly going to carry them on to whatever the next metamorphosis or chapter is in their career once they drop their next record and all I can say right now is that I'm looking forward to that I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it your the best year the best swish should i review next

Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new beach fossils LP clash the truth this is the long awaited sophomore full-length LP from the new york band beach fossils whose self-titled debut pretty much got the ball rolling on a pretty big trend in underground indie rock and pop that's been just rolling and rolling and rolling over the past few years and that trend is just steady guitar-driven and echoey dream pop kind of like the light beach visiting pastel-colored cousin to the indie rock we once knew typically on the albums that have featured this style the vocals tend to be kind of apathetic the guitar tones are usually pretty stringy trevally with shimmering echoes on them maybe little bland and sound strum patterns drum patterns melody as well from the guitar and the vocals too they don't really tend to be that I guess sort of distinct or or flavorful when it comes to composition to me this sound has always been fine for a few songs or like a single but it all kind of tends to blend together in this really sort of unrewarding and kind of boring way when I listen to an entire album of it from beginning to end this has kind of been the tune that I've been singing whenever I've talked about a record in this style whether it be in a review or a y-you know review or a blogpost whatever and because of this sort of bias and this general uninterested music that has this sound in this style I wasn't anticipating expecting much from this new Beach fossils LP even though I did like the last EP that they put out which actually had wild nothing on it however I have to say with this new album I'm pleasantly surprised and not only because I think the band is writing better tunes the production is better on this LP but I just did not anticipate the kind of variety that Beach fossils would bring on clash the truth and the detail - I mean for one the vocals on this LP are way more audible than on any other previous efforts I mean they're they're no longer a prison to the reverb and the echo that they constantly use throughout every single song the melodies on this LP pop the playing and the instrumentation overall is just more energetic I've seen the band live a couple times they rock their songs out way harder in person than they are on record and I'm just feeling the interplay I'm feeling the momentum I'm feeling the grooves on this album there's actually more than one guitar tone on this album - there's thinner tones thicker ones some distortion here and there acoustic guitar and all of these additions are being brought into this new record while the band kind of still sticks to its signature sound the mood that this band usually brings to the table is still there the accessibility is still there simplicity is still a key feature to their sound what beach fossils does across this 35 minute record is not all that technical or flashy not profound not even I guess I would say novel at this point now that we have a bunch of albums popping up in this very same style every single year but on clash the truth Beach fossils does some embracing some soul searching of their influences and just end up with a more solid record because of it the introductory track on here is a bit of post-punk kind of Joy Division influence and has these very catchy chanted group vocals kind of a mantra it's a very lively start for this typically sleepy band and though the song is sure along with a lot of others on here Beach fossils kind of have this way of keeping their songs so stripped down yet so energetic that the brevity feels so complete anyway in the same way that a punk band like wire would the band kind of continues to put a defining characteristic on every single song on this LP like the track generational synthetic which has this galloping snare drum this descending vocal melody that's sticking in my head as well as some very melodic guitar phrasing or the chorus and the acoustic track on here that comes shortly after sleep apnea is a decent song as well it's a little short it's the one moment on this LP that I feel it could have been fleshed out more but I like the very sort of dreamy psychedelic textures that the band brings this track the song really feels tired in the way that a lack of sleep hood would make you feel but even songs on this LP that feel well within beach fossils comfort zone have this sort of new vibrance to them with just harder playing and some more detail like the song careless which has these burning guitar leads all over the place a danceable drumbeat all these sweet young male group vocals mmm the song is simultaneously sleepy intoxicating and poppy and exciting the tracks on this LP it's not like Beach fossils is pumping out these 15 minute epic progressive monsters but clash the truth features the band's most fleshed out material yet with melodies that actually stick out and are memorable and verses and courses that actually kind of feel like they're coming from different spots there's contrast there it just doesn't feel like this one endless sleepy tired boring blob of a song the band continues to put a distinct characteristic into every single song on this LP like the song burned you down which has this tick-tock tight dance beat the song birthday has some shark biting distortion on it but it washes over the whole track in this kind of My Bloody Valentine worship sort of way and the song in vertigo actually features Kasim Aquino from Blonde Redhead on vocals she slides into the song very nicely along with the male vocals that the band usually provides it's sweet to see them kind of tribute Blonde Redhead because they're no doubt an influence I love the stringy layers of guitar on the song caustic cross they're soft but they scream out confidently against these very fill filled drumbeats which hit me and remind me that man just overall the drumming on this LP is so much better there are a few drones on here a few interludes which are placed very nicely not taking away from the momentum of the album and the sounds that they actually bring forward our very pretty adding to the dreamy quality of the album this LP was put together really well Beach fossils actually conceived this album with just a grandeur point of view they weren't just trying to put together a bunch of singles that ended up sounding like crap when you put them together into an album overall the band sticks to its light and and youthful sound but feels mature and detailed enough to the point where you can actually take it seriously but not too seriously because really it's it's all about fun maybe you could make the argument that this LP is to say me say me for its own good I'm sure that there are going to be some people who are turned off a little bit by the band's constant constant dreamy sound but I still find this LP personally to be diverse enough to be enjoyed and a really interesting crossroads of things like indie rock shoegaze dream pop as well as punk rock the vocals could have been maybe a bit more distinct and that of course you know I would love to hear them lay on more melody in the future but there's not really any huge complaints from me honestly I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Beach fossils forever [Music] you "},{"id":"4lsuigFrAjY","title":"Code Orange - I Am King ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone and chubby fish tuna here the Internet's fishiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cool coat code orange record I am king these guys are at Pennsylvania hardcore and metalcore band this is their sophomore full-length LP they've got a heavy and raw sound they drop their first full-length album back in 2012 on this record they were certainly showing quite a bit of promise really had the whole hardcore world watching with the fact that this album dropped on Death Wish records and they had Curt blue of converge producing I remember crushing riffs on this album type performances good recording some pretty raw vocals but not really much else to me what kind of held this record back was somewhat lackluster writing which in a genre that is typically very fast loud simple and blunt is something that is sort of hard to define or savor but since the inception of hardcore punk and metalcore there have been groups that have run the gamut of creativity bands like converge that are hectic and musically dense the very righteous and wordy and straightforward Minor Threat or groups that are a heavy dark brooding sonic assault like nails and with this new record of there's Code Orange kids essentially sit further on that more dissonant noisy dark and heavy side of hardcore and metalcore right now this record is thrash and bash it does not really have much in the way of finesse nor do I think it wants finesse there are vocals on this record as well not just guitars and drums but I wouldn't really say the vocals come off as having that much to say or communicate the lyrics are pretty unintelligible but vocally there's quite a bit of variation here there are some general hardcore screams just those throat ripping shouts there are some guttural growls metalcore grunts the occasional clean vocal and for whatever reason sometimes muttering yes some of the tracks on here do feature muttering I'm not sure why but they do the vocals on the cell P really are more for sound and emotion and effect than they are a message pretty much Code Orange kids are rather Code Orange now because they have removed the kids sorry they really let their riffs and their production do much of the talking for them together Code Orange and Curt Beaulieu have pulled together and insanely heavy pummeling album the riffs just how thick and how punchy they are along with the drums is just suffocating this record is abusive it's overbearing I really think Curt blue just inches forward into producing his loudest heaviest album yet here so in that regard this record is kind of in advancement it's sort of refreshing but once again code orange is writing is just really nothing to get that excited about or really even remember on track for track book track the band just passes from one indiscernibly sluggish breakdown riff fest to another occasionally devolving into something that sounds like it could have come off of a new metal record in the year 2000 like on the song buying you the intro there or code oranges slow sluggish riff on slots show such little variance that the song just gets stale before it's over like alone in a room even though the the closing track here mercy it is the longest track here it is four minutes but the band does a pretty decent job of keeping it engaging for that duration even though the various parts the band kind of just throws against the wall do feel a little disjointed it don't feature like some really good or creative for fluid segues that bring the song from one part to another the only thing that gives these tracks some significant sonic separation are these tiny trinkets they manage to weave into the heavy riffs like the opener on here which has these just start/stop guitar drones that feel like they could have come out of a horror movie trailer or slow burn which behind the riffs on this track there's this very tinny sharp and very ear grabbing clinging clanking pinging it's very metallic it's very or the song your body is ready which has these very thin dissonant guitar peji O's that kind of bounce back and forth between the riffs the very dissonant shrill guitar chords on my world me me me or the song my world which features the kind of faint distant overly reverb background vocals that I would hear more often in like someone's bedroom shoegaze project versus a hardcore or metalcore album which at the end of the day isn't really that much of a compliment to this albums bone snapping riffs so yeah each track does have a little trick up its sleeve but it's only a small distraction from what is essentially one nonspecific riffey slugfest after another I'm pretty on the fence with most of these tracks there are some songs on here I do like such as I am King and your body is ready as well as unclean spirit but to me these songs are just nice coherent metalcore tracks where the riffs and the momentum seem pretty constant throughout the song the various parts of these tracks either flow into one another or complement one another nicely plus to me these songs don't go so overboard with the breakdowns as other songs do Code Orange despite the name change I've just put out another record that I feel a little on the fence with but maybe I just like slightly at the end of the day even though I think their sound and their performances are very aggressive very intense very massive I think code orange continues to be more hardcore soldiers than they are hardcore superiors I'm feeling a strong v to light six on this LP transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana code orange forever "},{"id":"y8JUeP3ODic","title":"CHVRCHES - Every Open Eye ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"ah hi everyone roar thony roar tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of new churches album every open eye churches re Glasgow pop and electro pop trio who broke a handful of years ago with some fantastic little pop singles like recover and the mother we share I think churches went on to hold their own onto a debut EP titled after that recover single however I think they rushed a little bit into their first full-length album we're about halfway through the LP I think the band displayed a little bit of a lack of ideas still I thought this help you did have some decent tracks on it I for the most part enjoy Lorin Mayberry as a singer her voice to me is a little childish a little light on the ears but I think she has some good range and she certainly sings with conviction on some of these tracks especially during the big loud booming choruses she has range and I think churches as a group has potential more potential than they displayed on their debut record however I can't really say I was excited going into this new full-length album because none of the singles really piqued my interest however a cowl is definitely looking forward to it I love you Laurie now you love you older I can't believe you said that you sexist pig well on this new LP over here churches don't really change anything up in any significant way the production sounds a little boo me kind of gargantuan a little more high budget but that's about it a lot like purity ring earlier this year I think the band is kind of taken a step toward glossy gutless nests however the separating factor for me between churches and a project like purity ring is that Lauren Mayberry can be an exciting front woman although I think she does better over a lot of the peppier more explosive tracks in the track listing here when it comes to subtlety and and and maybe intimacy I don't really think she has that much to offer especially during the very subdued closing track on this record we're not only hear about the instrumental itself just is really drab and kind of bland it's a bit of a directionless cliffhanger here not the strongest writing on this record though interestingly enough the very finish of this track in a way sounds like it sort of sets the tone for the intro track on here almost as if you could just kind of play this album continuously in a loop and there's never really a point at which it sounds like it should stop maybe unless you kind of get tired of it then I guess it should stop the intro track on here though never-ending circles it's a decent song it's got blossoming shimmering choruses that are really bright kind of catchy even though almost every single thing in the mix here sounds synthetic the instrumental presentation still feels very large almost as if I'm listening to a full band or something the the sound is very wide it's very panoramic even though it is kind of sanitary in a sense the song leave a trace as well has a pretty sharp chorus too and when these courses burst in Lauren makes sure to really pick up the intensity on her vocals she sounds really in sync with the instrumentals here however I think the verses on both of these tracks and on other tracks here too are totally boring and insipid and under written it's almost as if churches is taking the approach that so many other pop acts do and that's that they just underwrite and completely neglect their verses to the point where there's nothing really interesting going on lyrically or melodically so that the course is sound even more important than they really are the first song and the track listing here that I love from front to back is the song keep you on my side which comes right out of the gate totally fiery with a bustling instrumental just a very busy set of beats hanging in the background Lauren's vocals quiver with passion in the instrumental here when the chorus breaks in there's just this pumping dance beat and there are these really pretty synth flourishes that are kind of dancing in the left and right channels this to me is an excellent example of churches pulling together a song that is beautiful but also has a lot of pop but after this the instrumentals and even Lauren herself head in a really mild direction like on the song make them gold or on clearest blue where the only saving grace of this track is the pumping loud thunderous bridge on the back end of the song on track six churches tries to pass off another song without lauren Mayberry's vocals just like they did on their first album there are so many formulas that are running parallel from their debut record to this record over here and just like on their last record the singing is not good and I have no idea why with such a capable front woman they would continue to put tracks into their records especially with subpar vocals that don't feature her for me this is a record where I was hoping that churches would come through with some more bold and distinct ideas and take a few risks which i think is necessary for this part of their career especially considering that every single girl producer duo or trio wants to be this group they want to play with this sound and they're copying everything that churches does but instead churches is just simply repeating themselves and tossing out mediocre tracks like this now the fire on this record comes back with a song empty threat didn't love that vocal melody on that hook oh there's some throbbing old-school synthesizers on this track and some really righteous lyrics coming through on the song too however I still can't help but feel like much of this record just feels like a high gloss high budget repeat of what we heard on the last album which I guess if you loved the last album that probably won't be too bad of a thing but for me what was an issue on the last record is that there were a lot of tracks that paled in comparison to others because the writing really wasn't that fantastic and that's essentially the case once again on here there are at least a handful of songs on here that I think are really fantastic but for almost every track on here that I think is great there's another song that I am skipping immediately while a whole bunch of other tracks just kind of meet somewhere in the middle of being fantastic and just being a nightmare I'm pretty indifferent toward this record overall I'm feeling a decent strong 5 on this thing Tran have you given this wrecker to listen if you did you probably enjoy it a lot more than me and that's completely fine you don't have to be indifferent about this album like I am you can enjoy it that's totally okay but if you enjoyed this album more than me which you most likely did and you're pissed off at this point in the review and you wish I was dead do your best to explain in the comments with out wishing death upon me to tell me what about the album appeals so much to you cool cool have a good one bye

here of the new kero kero bonito record the neato generation these guys are UK pop trio that have been dropping singles and they have a mix tape out they've been active for a few years now but they have somehow just flown under my radar which makes me sad but I guess now that I'm now hearing of them because of this new commercial full-length debut record that their music is just a nice pleasant surprise to me because I'm coming into this album with fresh ears having not even heard the teaser singles from it and for a pop record this thing is all over the map we have songs on here that feel like they pull influence from you know your average top 40 hit some club friendly trap music like tonight or some very bouncy UK bass in the vein of disclosure there's a huge j-pop influence on this thing especially considering the bilingual lyrics both English and Japanese on this record you know if you if you like yourself Oh some really cute Japanese pop artists like Kyary Pamyu Pamyu I think you're gonna find something to love on this record also hip hop music and in the early releases of m.i.a whose music was really just hard-hitting but also had a lot of swagger and charisma was a little tongue-in-cheek and playful also video game music from the late 90s and early 2000s their instrumentals on this thing the sound like they could have worked as the Start screen to some kind of Japanese racing game with the cute anime women in bathing suits and there's actually one track on this thing that samples sound from Mario Kart 64 the song graduation and and then there's tunes on this thing that remind me of like synthesizer laced tongue-in-cheek pop music from web series such as like food party or don't hug me i'm scared specifically the song try me where sara is sort of listing off the things that she's very talented at whether it be dancing or planning a party with you or a business the song fishbowl even dabbles in like a little bit of fun sunny beach pop - there's a lot going on through all these tracks but it's all kind of fit under this umbrella of the trios very cute demeanor there sense of humor they're sugary melodies they're kind of quirky synthesizers but probably the most important ingredient are these very charming lovable songs that they draw up like the song wake up which kicks the album off which is this playful punchy banger about waking up which kicks off with an alarm clock ringing it has a bustling beat with lots of bass some bright horn samples that hit throughout the chorus Sara's singing throughout the track about having things to do today not wanting to wake up hitting the snooze button it's like I've suddenly woken up on the set of some kind of like J pop hip-hop infused pee-wee's Playhouse the song heard a song is about hearing a song on the radio but only for a moment and you don't know who actually made the song and the melodies just stuck in your head and sort of driving you insane because you can't find out who the artist is you're wondering if you even made it up and again this is another track that's like loaded with sound effects to kind of help tell the story that Sarah is singing about on the song as she sort of stops her car to hear the song and her tires screech on the road later she's asking her two other bandmates Gus and Jamie whether they've heard the song and they can't help her the song's graduation and hey parents are sort of these really endearing tributes to growing up and becoming an adult and moving on to I don't know this post college stage where you have to take care of yourself tracks like this are especially interesting because they kind of address directly how kero kero Benito straddles this border between adulthood and childhood there are obviously some adult themes and grown-up issues on this record but much of the album sort of sounds like a kid could have written her or a kid would enjoy it the song break is an incredibly adorable track about taking a break slowing things down taking it easy knowing when to just kind of pump the brakes a little bit and realize that you've had enough or you're doing a little too much there's a funny part in the song where Sarah's sort of calls or two other band members just say hey guys I'm not doing anything today and the chorus on here sort of has I don't know a bit of a nugget of wisdom on here singing about how it's really hard to relax when you have something to do pretty much every track comes through with a solid but quirky and colorful instrumental that's very kind of silly and off-the-wall a pretty focused song topic which is executed with just a deadly amount of cuteness like just imagine a a pink Guzzi that shoots out unicorn sparkles rapid-fire song trampoline features this punchy house beat with loads of lyrics about being on a trampoline floating through the sky feeling alone but jumping with others as well doing twists and flips it's so enjoyably blissful so happy and so infectious and that's just kind of this album as a whole this is some real like good candy coated pop music like candy coated pop music you could actually like sink your teeth into I don't feel like tossing it away after I'm done listening to it in fact I just have to go back to it again and again and again and it brings some seriously good vibes to it's like very happy it's very upbeat and not in a way where it's sickening or just too much at least not for me anyway I will say maybe the album's Achilles heel is that there are a few tracks where the vocals are kind of faint and don't really sound that interesting and I will say that the trio style is slightly gimmicky it's not going to appeal to everybody but I think kero kero bonito has a lot of great things going for them a lot of style a lot of flair some good tunes I find their music to be very imaginative and I'm looking forward to whatever they do in the future after this thing I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this record transition and that is the video that is the review here I hope you have given this album a listen and let me know what you think of it down in the comments all sorts of links next to my head subscription videos

finish reet Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new playboy cardi album die lit this is the debut full-length album from rapper double XL freshman and ASAP mob affiliate playboy cardi who is coming off of a somewhat hot 2017 with a kind of successful self-titled mixtape and his breakout two times platinum hit song Magnolia even on this single track alone cardi proved himself to be a new face to be reckoned with in the rap world even if I wasn't crazy about his debut tape or I thought that his double XL freshman cypher performance was really underwhelming I still named magnolias one of my favorite singles of the year my 50 favorite singles of 2017 video and why why is that why did I do that not only is Magnolia an insanely infectious song but also to me at the time it felt like the logical conclusion to everything trap had been trending toward for like the past 7 years the hypnotic production the ad-libs the repetition all culminating into this raw euphoric psychedelic energy it just felt like the next step in this new wave of rap minimalism and dial it is essentially an extension of that but this time er find a little bit more because on this record it feels like cardi has a better appreciation of what exactly makes his music tick or has at least found better ways to create kind of an entrancing vibe and in a way it's kind of inspiring to see how much feeling he conjures on these tracks with so little in a way die lit while not a perfect record it is a reminder of the power of simplicity the song fell in love with Bryson tiller I think is a pretty prime example of that again maybe if we stay on the surface of this song and just pay attention simply to the lyrics the track doesn't seem like much but it would only be a trick to convince ourselves that there's nothing else going on here I mean with the light splashy cymbals and the ghostly skipping synth chords the reversely melody is the gentle trap drums and cardies kind of entrancing distant flows the song is actually incredibly relaxing its blissful it feels like it's kind of creating the feeling of love itself and Bryson tiller slightly loaf I feature actually adds quite a bit to the track I think it's one of his best features in a while and it actually adds to the weirdly surreal vibe of the song now in my opinion this is one of many track on this thing that is worthy of compliments in a closed ear really the only points on this album that kind of leave me feeling underwhelmed are when a song is so short it's kind of hard to get into the vibe or when lyrically and instrumentally so little is going on that I kind of feel this sense of stagnation in the track songs like old money in foreign and middle of the summer just a little too on the short side also with the middle of the summer the lyrics I think are just a little too vapid to ignore the song pull up I do have a bit of a love-hate relationship with while it is too simple to really celebrate I do kind of like how brazen cardi is in just packing the track out mostly with these weird little high-pitched mouth gun sounds pew pew oops no time I think could have had a lot more going on that actually did and the song Love Hurts as well as a song that was tough to get into at first featuring Travis Scott again because they're just instrumentally is so little going on but I actually think this moment kind of switched for me a little bit because it's another moment that is so brazenly minimal that it's like why it's like really challenging themselves to just be rapping over almost nothing after a track like this I think it's kind of hard to argue that cardi is a rapper who is dependent on a beat to make him sound good because I mean his lead vocals and Travis's lead vocals and their ad-libs make more sound in the mix and the beat itself so with the exception of those tracks that I'm either a little weirded out by or slightly underwhelmed by a majority of the songs on this thing I think are quite good I'm pretty enamored with just how uncomplicated and catchy a lot of them are and not to mention cardies supremely effortless vibe his very strange nasally cadence and tweaked-out flows the song long time features these really nice gentle cycling warbly synth chords cardies hypnotic flows are kind of enhanced by his ad-libs which bounce off his lead vocals kind of like a nice sharp delay it's a nice silky serene intro to the album kind of sets the tone for the whole thing really well the song leaned for real features these epic and subtly ghosty synth chords this repetitious mantra of being on beans for Rio being on lean for real being on beans for real being on lean for real it's one of many extremely psychedelic moments on the that are actually overwhelming skeptics on the track is pretty decent he breaks up what could have been a lot of monotony on the song his performance is pretty cutthroat so that's nice and then we have the song shoot of featuring little Aussie vert which is not only significant because it's one of the better tracks here but also because featuring with cardi was a pretty important moment for cardi back in 2017 in a way cardi and Uzi are kind of artistic kindred spirits also with all the glamourous Chinese synthesizers and strings all over this track once the beat eventually kicks in it sounds like a trap Christmas I'm a song poke it out we have Nicki Minaj featuring who for a second tries to get into cardis style by throwing out you know some weird vocalizations and ad-libs eventually she gets a bit more lyrical with some creative references to Apple phone FaceTime cardies music Magnolia but really what kind of sells the song or the quirky synth leads they have a bit of a woodwind tone to them and of course the ear worm refrain poke it out poke it out poke it out poke it out the song home kod is a track just filled with all these bitter relationship bars the cycling instrumental is so tight and so I guess anxiety inducing it makes me feel like I'm trapped in the same bad relationship that Carly is rapping about the song mileage features another synthetically gorgeous and in luscious instrumental and I guess I also want to mention this track because cardi rapping about not being interested or not caring about how many partners significant others had before him by way of saying he doesn't care if your pussy has some mileage I mean I don't know seems like a watershed moment for feminism and the trap genre to me yeah it's a point on the flatbed freestyle cardi kind of Wow's me with these weird nasally vocalizations I think he kind of squeezes his voice into his upper register in some pretty weird ways that makes the song kind of entertaining definitely in odds stand out it's moments like this that make me feel like this album is legitimately dipping its toes into experimental hip hop and the song chopper won't miss not only has a decent young thug feature on it but it also kind of feels like a bit of a musical sequel to Magnolia the beats are eerily similar cardi references that track and borrows the same flow from it but this time it just feels a little nastier I guess and speaking of nasty the song our IP features some of the most aggressive bars on the entire record snatching people's chains and and all that there's some weird sour descending synth lines on the cut and some really grimy deep distorted bass and pretty much that's it for highlights for me I mean a lot of good tracks on here overall while the record may feel a little bloated at nineteen tracks and cartee sound his style does stretch a little thin because he doesn't do that much with it also with things being is oversimplified as they are cardi doesn't do a whole lot with structure on some of these tracks but that pretty much does it for my complaints on this record overall I think there's a lot of creativity here it's pretty one of a kind project at least right now until maybe dozens of other artists copy exactly what David is doing and I can certainly see the temptation to do that going forward because while what kardi is doing here is incredibly simple from a technical standpoint it's probably incredibly easy to just write off entirely but there is an especially intoxicating catchy and almost mind-altering quality to the simplicity of some of these tracks that I just can't get enough of I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

description check them out support them because they support us and I'll leave you guys off to they were key now thank you very much hi everyone Shana is here the Internet's busiest music nerd that back and it's time for a review of the new alt-j album relaxor UK progressive and art pop outfit all today this is their third full-length album which I was really excited to hear due to my enjoyment of their past two albums and I thought the teaser tracks from this record leading after the release were pretty decent and if you would ask me about all J back in 2012 when they released their first album and awesome wave I most likely would have told you that they were one of the more unique groups to debut an album that year with their kind of seamless and very inventive blend of hip-hop and pop music electronic music as well with a touch of bulk their sound was really idiosyncratic not only with the blend of styles but the band's approach to groove also the very Yelp e nasal lead vocals from the band's frontman Joe Newman and yet the band's music was so freakin catchy not easy balance to strike now the band's follow-up record this is all yours took a much more obtuse and subtle approach this album was the definition of a slow burner a lot of tracks on this thing were not consistent sonically with a lot of what was on the band's debut which in my opinion was okay because the band had proven on their first record that they were so above the fray that what was their sound really I mean alt-j conceivably could go in a million different directions with their sound based on what they had given us on their debut surely I couldn't expect the band to give us one more in awesome wave after another for the next decade so going into this new LP I wasn't entirely sure what to expect maybe just another direction entirely something completely refreshing I do know that going into this album I did enjoy for the most part 3ww in cold blood Adaline but now that I have the entire album in front of me I'm kind of surprised to find that it's just eight tracks in 39 minutes and as I moved along the tracklist I kind of felt that this was easily all Jays most inconsistent album to date not just in terms of sound from traffic track but that also holds true for the songwriting - you know even though this is all yours was a bit of a challenging listen at least that album felt like it had a focused sonic concept from beginning to end by contrast there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to what's happening on relaxer whether it be why on the third track were suddenly treated to a really blobby and kind of tensionless cover of House of the Rising Sun yes that House of the Rising Sun alt Jay's version here really leaves a lot to be desired and then suddenly we are transitioned into one of the kookiest and more hard-hitting songs on the entire record hit me like that snare where I think the band mistakes effortless awkwardness for swagger so not only do we make some weird surprise transitions between tracks and songs but occasionally some of the tracks themselves within the song are kind of difficult to follow or sort of tedious like the finishing pleater on the album while the end of this track may have some really grand choral vocals and a really beautiful instrumental presentation the very sleepy lead up to this moment makes the end feel almost inconsequential trying to get the band to deliver one of these more instrumentally lavish songs in a direct fashion is kind of like getting someone shy to start a conversation occasionally I think the band's roundabout approach to songwriting on this record does kind of work out I mean I do still like 3w especially as an opener I do think it kind of sets the tone for the record as unpleased as that tone may be as I listen to the entire album the folky acoustic guitars and very serene sound palette at the start of the album reminds me a lot of yellow house era grizzly bear while these subtle touches of piano and vocal harmonies kind of transition me into a beautiful lullaby the song takes a pretty intriguing instrumental turn after this and the inclusion of vocals from Ellie Roswell sort of turns the track really sensual but the song trails often fizzles out not too long after this and looking at the runtime it's kind of hard to believe that the track is five minutes long because I feel like there are just so many different parts of the the song that hit you so quickly you know developed for all that long you know there are a lot of parts on this song and I feel like there's a lot to these parts on the song but when they're added up I something I feel like is missing I could say that the band is maybe just being intentionally esoteric here but even the moments on this record where I feel like they're being really straightforward don't pack that much punch like on the song in cold blood while it's still one of the better tracks on the track listing here I will take many songs off of an awesome wave over this any day though again the boomy percussion and the epic horn sections on this track that groove the kind of tinny very bright synthesizer arpeggios that they're definitely a saving grace among some of the paler songs in the tracklist dead crush is easily another pick for me as a favorite on the album while I do think that the synth bass line is a little lazy and that the guitars that are driving or a bit plain you know the atmosphere isn't the most colorful or eccentric sparse instrumentation when it comes to all J but the lead vocals and especially the falsettos are very kooky very fun and incredibly catchy Adaline still stay as one of my favorites on the album easily the best slow burner here it feels like a really gradual cinematic ascent into the night sky with all these hypnotic percussive taps and swelling orchestral instrumentation that's really cloudy and pillowy and beautiful some of the wild background vocals and the last half of the track I feel like is one of those moments where all Jays sort of weird strange very cartoonish musical ideas are at their best is it too much to ask for a strong ending though the song last year is really pleasant but it's easily one of the most half-baked ideas in the entire track listing the lyrics are very poetic at times incredibly moving sort of detail what seems like month to month to month of the last year in Joe Newman's life a lot of very personal moments sung about in this song I like the closing duet in the second half of the song as well but again it just feels like a linear moment where the band doesn't really stick to or develop any one idea long enough for anything to stick or has a significant amount of consequence to it I'm not really sure what happened with this album I can't help but feel like the band put some kind of strange and very unorthodox limitations on the writing and maybe the recording process of this record in order for it to have turned out the way that it did because it feels like a lot of the ideas a lot of the writing feels really fly-by-night lightning in a bottle again the band doesn't stick to any one idea long enough everything is sort of progressing in a linear fashion not too much in the way of repeating courses or frames which I don't necessarily think are bad limitations to put on an album that is if the progressions and the direction that you're going in is a purposeful one is an urgent one is an engaging one unfortunately without a modus operandi - a lot of these tracks it seems like alt J's writing and performances have turned really flaccid standoffish kind of disengaged very forgettable and in contrast with their past work especially their debut some unsure itself at points yeah this this was a really strange listen I mean I might you know be interested in listening to it again if I understood more maybe about the process of what the band was trying to achieve going into this record just to kind of maybe hear what I think they were trying to do but honestly just as a raw kind of listening experience from someone who's enjoyed their past two albums this was a really lackluster and underwhelming experience for me I'm feeling a like five on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love because you hate it what would you're ready to hear the best you're the best will

everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new park GEHA album communion this is the full-length debut album of South Korean composer and multi-instrumentalist Park Ji ha who is handy on reed instruments such as the piri and mouth organ but also the hammered dulcimer and also on this album respectively she also features Kim okie John Bell and Kang - kin who bring tenor sax and bass clarinet and vibraphone and percussion now going into this record originally I was intrigued by the advertised clash of genres coming together on this thing Korean traditional music and jazz and minimalism and certainly all of those influences apply to this album the issue though is just not all that consistently to the point where across this very short tracklist the record wasn't entirely sure what it wanted to be there are seven tracks on this thing and and what mix of genres you're getting really kind of depends on which track you're listening to there is the stunning and sprawling opening track where just these gorgeous Reed's skate majestically across an icy bed of vibraphone one of the truly seamless fusions of Korean traditional music and jazz accompaniment on the album the performance on this thing is transcendental and features some really great improvisation in the second half and I think the only track and the track listing that came as close to being this exciting and having this much instrumental density had to be the song All Souls Day where Park isn't playing a reed instrument but instead the hammered dulcimer along with a backdrop of similar jazz instrumentation the track is a very meditative progression but hits an incredibly chaotic conclusion with these crashing dulcimer notes and wailing reeds and kind of dissonant vibraphone it sounds like heaven crashing down on the earth and it's a total bloodbath it's it's completely worthy of the title All Souls Day now while not the nail-biters that these songs are there are some surrounding tracks that are quite decent slightly diminished in terms of genre crossover and instrumental density I enjoy the early droney Cerebral introduction to the album which I presume features the mouth organ which has an incredibly otherworldly sound it comes off almost synthetic and tambour and features these strange stuttering vibrato z' which sound like they were drummed up in like a digital audio workstation or something it just sounds like completely not of this galaxy the track in general is a great introduction and is just gorgeous mysterious and strange then there are these solo hammered dulcimer pieces in the tracklisting which admittedly underwhelmed me quite a bit the dulcimer playing is a lot more pensive than a lot of the more Reed centric tracks on the tracklist tank both tracks feature super subtle progressions and reach similarly noisy and kind of aggressive finishes the second of these two dulcimer pieces sounds heard from the moon sounds eerily similar to that of the last track which it pretty much just sounds like the same exact composition but now we're hearing sax along with it which I love the addition of that sax I think it brings so much to the composition I just wish that was the only instance in which we heard this composition in the tracklisting like dis hearing it pretty much a second time but with another instrument really add that much to the record in my opinion not really you know I think this record has a really interesting combination of of stylistic and musical ideas there are some great performances on here there's a good recording but the album just has a really odd flow and it's not that consistent there are some great ideas here I would just love to hear them fleshed out into something that is just a little bit more cohesive though I can say that a lot of tracks on here individually are fantastic I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry

Conflict ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"oh whoa hey everyone hi hi hey hey hi hi hey hi Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new own palette record in conflict Owen Pallett is a singer a songwriter a composer a violinist really a multi-instrumentalist and a ranger and for years he has lain lush instrumentation into the tracks of the indie elite like Arcade Fire and grizzly bear and Jim Guthrie and Titus Andronicus had up in the National and Taylor Swift and Linkin Park Owen has collaborated a lot but his music whether it be under his own name or Final Fantasy has an essence of its own Owens music takes a very dramatic tender and theatrical approach to immaculately layered chamber pop instrumentally his approach is usually more refined and beautiful than it is catchy bubblegum or immediate for sure Owen does not come off as straightforward as other chamber pop other baroque pop artists out there like Kishi Bashi or Andrew Bird or Sufjan Stevens to me Owen Pallett records like Heartland take a much more musical theater approach to the writing and the presentation of the melody of the lyrics the string arrangements don't really have any snap or pop to them a lot of the time they're just very softly and gently adding drama to the singing and the storyline Owens tracks in my head whenever I listen to an Owen Pallett song I see a bunch of people on stage under spotlights in Victorian dress all singing in unison and working at these sort of lay miserably choreographed dance moves even though there are tracks on here like on a path and I'm not afraid which to me are oh in as usual instrumentally his vocals feel kind of distant there's a splash of reverb there in front of him it seems like there's a pit orchestra of stringed instrument ation oh and multi-tracks his vocals and creates vocal harmonies he makes use of horns as well it's a very intricate assembly of instrumentation but the builds the crescendos in these tracks they're very gentle the very subtle they're very soft and despite some of the electronic elements woven into these tracks it all feels very organic still despite continuing a lot of these familiar characteristics Owen Pallett tries to write some of his most straightforward material yet on this thing like the title track on here which has this really strong constant groovy bassline a drumbeat I've never heard an Owen Pallett song that is so groove intensive there's all these swirling synth arpeggios working to the song as well just this more constant rhythmic instrumentation in the background really picks up the mood of Owens music and just because this is playing a larger role doesn't mean that the strings are really taking a backseat because he really has a lot of strange experimental flourishes and embellishments of strings throughout the track Owen continues this straightforward streak on tracks like the secret seven and song four five and six or the song coral which has these clicking twittering little bits of rhythm in the right channel of the track just making such a quiet sound the horn sections on this track are just sweeping to me Owens music is sounding more textured it's sounding more punctuated than ever I really admire the risks that he's taking with instrumentation on this record and I think it's leading to a lot of positive results especially on a track like riverbed which is the one track on this LP that is incredibly loud and I think Owens the loudest track yet man is this song crushing in a sense with these wailing screaming violin leads there's a heavy kick drum on this track a really strong snare I just love the melody of this song the melody that the strings are playing and the melody that own is singing as well isn't too bad either but his vocals are continually not the most gripping thing in these songs I will get into that in a second but I want to say that I've never been so smitten with an own palette release instrumentally and yes even though Owens music does usually have beautiful strings in it at some point I think his tracks for four years have lacked the snap of the artists he usually does arrangements for so it's nice to hear faster tracks tracks with bigger synth accompaniment tracks with heavier beats songs that are just more lively in instrumental tone but to me Owens biggest Achilles heel throughout all of his discography kind of remains and that is his voice I don't think he's the worst singer in the world he certainly is great at writing vocal melodies that stand out past whatever the instrumentation behind him is doing melodically he does have kind of a flimsy falsetto but his voice rarely if ever strains mostly because I think he's really good about not writing himself out of his range I guess my main issue with Owens singing is that he's not the most passionate singer he doesn't have the most emotional power out there he doesn't really bring a lot of conviction to the table in my opinion to me the emotional tone in his vocals on a song like riverbed isn't all too different from the delivery that he uses on a slow tender song on here like the passions where Owen is telling what sounds like kind of a seduction story so yeah I do think Owens singing style can get a little mundane at points and can get drowned out by the instrumentation that he arranges and performs but at least the songs are written well the instrumentation is produced well the way the instrumentation is is arranged is fantastic for the most part I'm really liking this album I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana Owen Pallett forever "},{"id":"gHJrGGBcP0E","title":"Daughters- Self-Titled ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"daughter's self-titled hey my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd today this this week has just been full of computer problems there's nothing but computer problems but a good friend of mine has been helping me out with them you know his twitter name is down there in the d box if you're on Twitter at Twitter in him for helping me that would be really great funny joke for me yeah just Twitter at him hey dude you're awesome thanks also in the D box I had a radio interview Aeron WNPR 90.5 FM this morning you guys can go down there and give a listen to it and also there's a link to a really great little bonus album a free album from the hip hop producer exile down there to give that a listen stream that thing download the whole LP there's a description down there on the article that it's in its it's pretty good ok this is an album review of the new daughter's album itself titled they're from Rhode Island and at 27 minutes this is easily their longest studio effort this band has been labeled numerous things mostly genres that end in core and have garnered comparisons to bands like the locust some girls and I think fans of early and Albatross can appreciate daughter's music too but this self-titled album is a completely different headache when compared to their earlier releases a lot of changes on this thing for one the vocals instead of screaming instead of shrieking it sort of seems like just this really shouting forced yelling talking maybe like an angry auctioneer it kind of reminded me of Nick Cave especially his work with the birthday party which isn't really a surprise since this band contributed a track to a birthday party tribute album released the Baths daughters music on this LP is really no longer thrashy or sporadic like it used to be instead the band uses a lot of low-end a lot of distortion and a lot of compression to create this massive bone crushing sound which is really more my bread and butter as opposed to the whole trashy thing not to say that those earlier releases aren't worth their salt aggressive playing has its strong points but I just can't believe the guitar sounds on this LP the guitars on this thing sound like an electric evil church organ really if you get this thing out of big pair of speakers you had better get ready for a punishment another big change on this LP is daughters have work to make their songs a lot longer the longest of them just kind of inching over four minutes but I wouldn't say daughters have lost their taste for brevity because even though there are longer songs on here the band is constantly throwing different sounds at the listener whether it's guitar noise scraping against strings feedback media or some other sounds that I really just can't explain the band throws some left hooks on certain tracks just kind of break things up some piercing feedback on one song a dance beat on another song there was one track where I heard a guitar riff that was distinctly close to something that ZZ Top did on the track log range and there's some chants and some keyboards on the closing track too unless you have a D D nothing really sticks around long enough for it to get old and yet things repeat just enough times for them to be catchy this thing is noisy it's heavy just like I like it and I don't really have any gripes other than that it made me enter in a place here in a place there a lot of high scores this week and I'm very happy about that I'm very happy about that I'm feeling a decent eight on this thing which is a score I got from jumble junky music borrow that one from him maybe if it were a little more diversified this LP maybe a little bit more diverse it would have wowed me a bit more but still as is this thing is like a punch to the jaw with a brick how can't you how can you not appreciate that but what do you guys think of this thing are you loving it are you hating it my daughter's self-titled forever "},{"id":"ruUkn7A1nQs","title":"The Soft Moon- Zeros ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"me me me me hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the soft moon zeroes the soft moon is the musical project of Luis Vasquez this is his sophomore full-length LP and I'm really loving the influences that go into this album and the style it adds up to alright in comparison with the soft moon's debut LP this album is much more gothic ly tinged directly referencing some of post-punk and new waves most tortured artists enjoy division Bauhaus suicide I would even say from the texture the sonic textures in some of these tracks throbbing gristle could be an influence as well if you listen to this LP you're pretty much going to get a bunch of leather-clad dance rock songs that are kind of repetitive and for the most part instrumental and between the 10 tracks on here Vasquez creates some pretty awesome groove based atmospheres that authentically sound like they are coming from the era of music he's mimicking the song machines certainly earns its name I mean the track sounds like an industrial dance party on a strobe lit factory floor all the rhythms just are clanging and banging there's some very dark and murky synthesizer and bass on this track too and the gate is adjusted to on the drums to kind of get a big sharp sound in a way a perfect combo of dancing and darkness perfect for the Halloween party you just had however I find it difficult to kind of go go through this album track by track kind of looking at each song and talking about what it does differently because you know despite some tempo changes or just different shaped grooves nearly every track on here shoots for pretty much the same mood dance darkness vulgar to rock post-punk synthesizers lots of texture which isn't a bad thing consistency typically enhances an album and this album definitely has that consistency when it comes to sound the quality of the grooves that are being put out there and emotion however where this album seriously and I mean seriously lacks is in the songwriting Department I mean the attempt to write a song isn't even made really pretty much every track on this LP for me kind of feels like a really good goth rock song that never quite gets started I mean the groove is is certainly there on all of these tracks but it's not like any of the variations that Vasquez throws into the mix instrumentally or all that like that interesting and as I'm listening to these songs my mind is just constantly drifting thinking about man how great would it be to have a very dark deep dramatic vocalist on these tracks and maybe kind of a chorus or verse kind of you know coming after some of this groove Ness and I realize that there are some people are going to take the instrumental and repetitive qualities of this record and just say hey you know Anthony this is totally coming from a krautrock thing but in a way I kind of disagree because my favorite artists who are in that genre when they would be repetitive when they would be instrumental would kind of do in more of a a jam like way certainly noise is an example both however I mean the sounds the instruments on this LP don't sound like they're being played live or in a way that that creates chemistry or just kind of has an energy to it to me a lot of these instrumentals sound like they're just copied and pasted just kind of taking chunks of riffs and just looping looping looping looping them over and over and over either in a bedroom or a semi-professional studio and that really sucks the viscera out of a lot of these grooves and makes them kind of uninteresting to listen to for more than two three or in some cases on the Selphy for minutes and that issue is certainly universe on this entire LP I mean I'm really caught by the sounds that this album is putting forward but once I try to dive in you know I discovered that this big dark murky body of water was in fact just like a puddle there are just a lot of things that weren't on this LP for me I'm kind of feeling a strong 4 to a light five what did you think of it if you give it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the soft moon forever "},{"id":"r98hKTgtKiU","title":"CupcakKe - Ephorize ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cupcake album for eyes this is the latest full-length album from a Chicago rapper by the name of cupcake who's been turning a lot of heads over the past few years with her very wild very eccentric style cupcake is a one-of-a-kind rapper with a one-of-a-kind sound and an lyrical style and she's been prolifically dropping one project after another since 2016 come cake Queen Elizabeth and now this new album also audacious how can I forget about audacious if you're not getting it now a cupcake she comes on a little strong in her music it's not gonna be for everybody and the lyrical substance of her music often is very vulgar very sexual almost to a point of being like a pure gimmick but while she does put out a lot of tracks that push the boundaries of lewd I've also heard a lot of cuts on her recent albums that honestly are pretty moving she kind of bares it all emotionally on these tracks going into her personal history with abuse double standard she feels are there in the politics of sex and gender politics too and she's also come out with numerous tracks advocating for fair treatment of the LGBTQ community so my point is while cupcake is very funny she is no joke I've been following her stuff for a little while now and it seems like she hasn't really changed not even one bit as her music has gained more and more and more attention rather than changing it up now that the spotlight is on her it feels more like she is just kind of slowly fine-tuning everything she's been delivering up until this point her flow her lyrics her hooks and f Rises another artistic peak for cakey you do get a lot of the same familiar themes and topics and and flows from previous projects but there are slight improvements all around her delivery for one is more aggressive and compelling than ever she not only sounds like she's just angrily spitting on the beat it sounds like she's devouring the beat that deep growly voice of hers just seems to get better and better with every album the flows on this thing are tighter too and her pen game on record is kind of bordering on insane on at least a few of these cuts like yeah sure she's not like this a one storyteller or anything like that but she's dropping these incredible one-liners on some of the bangers of this project that are equal parts hilarious smart like that one line about her shirt getting ripped during sex and and then with that shirt being ripped it would become like a Yeezy like a piece of ez clothing also some of my favorite lines on the song duck-duck-goose go as follows this that submarine pussy mr. clean pussy this that I'm about to fuck you longer than the limousine pussy high self-esteem pussy it's a dream pussy if you broke then the pussy acting funny like a meme pussy Oh God Oh God meme pussy prudes need not apply obviously things get even crazier on the track cinnamon toast crunch probably cupcakes most aunt performance on the entire record I got bitches trying to box me like I'm Cinnamon Toast Crunch that's a bar also I should buy these hoes real suits because I'm everything they slack slack what what kill him with his tie kill him with his tie kill him with his tie that's a tie die also that one line on spoiled milk titties where she's talking about not having this person touch her booty hairs and as a result of that feeling like Solange and the song fullest which is this bulletproof closing track that features a nice sort of Latin horn sample and a great groove to has this one line on there on the refrain where she is rapping about being cold with the stick like a popsicle so overall on this record cupcakes similes are really on point I think more on point than they've been on any project before this of course in the the midst of the tracklist here she also delivers some topical tracks the song cartoons is chock full of amazing and hilarious and somewhat deep occasionally animation references the song post pic is a very funny observational track about her Instagram exploits if you have not seen cupcakes Instagram it's it's it's pretty steamy for the older people only kids don't go there yeah don't she has a hilarious bar on this track about men pleasuring themselves to her pictures on Instagram and and doing that so often the phones are messing up and and likening that sort of sexual act as like having sex itself to the point where you would like get an STD and you would have to have your blood checked the song single while taken is a love song but kind of a love on the rock situation and actually a lot smarter than I thought it was going to be when I was going into it kind of rapping about how when somebody's cheating on you are not being faithful or isn't really present in the relationship it makes you feel like you are single but also while in a relationship you're lonely but a part of a duo the song crayons is yet another tribute to the LGBTQ community not one of the best I think that she's penned but I do enjoy the sentiment of the track and I do like the angle she's taken here trying more to just kind of admirably and respectably take a picture of the community or kind of a party that she's attending there and self interview is probably the most grim and most introspective track that I think cupcake has put out thus far she has a lot of songs along these lines where she kind of self analyzes looks at her own behavior questions herself wonders where she can improve and how she can do better while also reflecting on the shortcomings of the world at large this to me is her most compelling track going in that direction overall cupcakes fundamentals on this record are better than ever I feel like she's come a long way when you compare this to a lot of her earlier material a lot of her flows a lot of the production some of the lyrics they're pretty rough around the edges I feel like listening to cupcake for the short amount of time that I have has been really a lot like just watching an artist craft their foundation and kind of grow into themselves so while those improvements are there I can't deny them there is an element of this record where I feel like the novelty has worn on me a little bit like I'm just merely listening to a slightly more polished version of something that I've already heard and while I do think this is cupcakes most professional sounding project yet I love her brazen sexuality I love her rawness I love her authenticity and I love her outlandish lyrics as well don't think she's bringing a whole lot in the way of new dynamics to these themes and to these ideas that she hasn't before it just kind of sounds better and more technically sound however my one major issue with this record and this has been a consistent issue I've had with cupcakes music in general is that I feel like the production it's pretty generic it's pretty dime-a-dozen it's your standard track banger affair unfortunately cupcakes beats in my opinion do not really truly reflect her unique personality there are a few tracks on here that feature an interesting melody or sample maybe a little bit of a dancehall vibe but honestly for as insane as an MC as cupcake is I feel like her production sadly continues to be an understatement like for as sexual as the song spoiled milk titties is I feel like going the slow subtle route on on that track was was not really the best direction among other production decisions on this record all that being said though I still think this is cupcakes most consistent solid and entertaining album yet I'm hoping this album isn't her last peek though because I feel like they're still improvements to be made from here I would love to see her open herself up to new themes new production styles that really truly complement her raw unique style and hopefully listeners continue to take to what she's doing on this record because I think cupcake really is truly a special rapper that not enough people are listening to right now I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it too Jane it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it's like

Hampton oh here the Internet's busy busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new fuck buttons album focus these guys are an experimental music duo whose aesthetic is really really electronic synthetic but their earlier stuff dealt much more and just the noisier more abrasive kind of droney side of things but on their 2009 album Tarot sport an album that a lot of people consider to be their breakout LP the duo was bringing in all of these techno influences with these straightforward driving kind of repetitive beats and on top of that the slow-moving chords the slow building nature of all the instrumentation that they were using led to some really epic vibes as well and even though I appreciate this side of fuck buttons music I appreciate that they try to create that sensation with their music ultimately it's their writing and it's sort of the the pace or rather the stillness of their music that kind of kills me melodically just compositionally I find a lot of the tracks to be really dull just cycling through the same chords and and melodic phrases again and again and again really with with not enough variation to make the songs interesting from front to back because for sure the songs that they write do catch my ear at the start of the track for me most of the time it seems like the only changes that they're interested in are making things louder making things softer or just adding more melodic elements to this sonic pig pile and it's it's just confusing to me that fuck buttons would take this structural and melodic approach with their songs time and time and time again because they're so great and meticulous when it comes to finding sounds and just finding interesting textures if you would work this hard to grab the most interesting sounds that you could find sounds that a lot of people are not toying with why would your music writing approach be so obvious really as obvious as a bad post rock song I will say the slow focus does bring a little are detailed to the table though than Tarot sport did fuck buttons does layer their tracks a little bit more the drones feel a bit more massive there are a few shorter tracks on here that I like quite a bit that feature these really fast arpeggios they feel like they could have been in some kind of 80s sci-fi progressive synth soundtrack even though there are elements of this album that add more character to fuck button style I still can't help but feel like progression of their songs is is still not a strong point and slow focus does try to imply this progression by just piling one looping snippet of sound on top of another looping snippet of sound to a higher degree than they did on their last album but I feel like all this has done is just dull the pain of the monotony that typically comes through on their tracks I would say the worst offender in this sense is the last track on the album hidden excess the longest song on slow focus opts for what are probably the blandest chords on the entire LP and this set of chords which which aren't even interesting at the start of the song just continue again and again and again and again from beginning to end on this track getting louder and louder and louder in this sort of boring melodic lead that's that's descending again I just feel like there's very little personality to the melodies and the chords that fuck buttons writes into their songs and and when I listen to a song like this I feel like no wonder there's not that much significant change to the music over the course of a 10 minute song when this is your main theme for sure on this track and others energy is their sound is their groove is their but the melody just seems like this incredibly neglected afterthought and I know that melody isn't really a strong point on on numerous albums that I may enjoy or in different styles of music but it seems like the melody is something that is being showcased on these tracks or is at least trying to play a pivotal role in what makes these songs what they are while fuck buttons does deal in a lot of noise and a lot of drones they do take the time to write chord progressions and the chord Russians they do use are really clear and in your face and very audible the chord progression on the opening track your brain freeze feels just as uninspired in a lot of ways but fuck buttons does manage to work in some kind of beat and melodic change up on the second half of the song which which does keep it kind of interesting maybe the tracks the Red Wing and sentient SAR my favorites on this LP though they do tend to be as repetitive as some of the other tracks on this album they do work with some really out there sounds Redwing has some really interview I just love the character of some of the synth sounds and just the the groove on this track and and sentient has a bit of an industrial vibe to it I would say really metallic really sort of nocturnal dark there's something about these tracks that kind of makes me feel like I'm listening to a coherent black dice song but in the case of the Red Wing you have all of these high-pitched ethereal just ringing droning out synthesizer notes that that have a bit of a thinness to them that makes me feel like I'm listening to some just tremolo picked post-rock guitars I wish it changed up more but it still does have a bit of an epic feel to it and beyond that there's not much more I can say about this LP the things that are really likable about this album are blatantly obvious I mean you've got the great grooves you've got the interesting drum sounds and synthesizer sounds odd noisy distorted electronics again there's a lot of personality there's a lot of character to the sounds the fuck buttons works into their tracks but consistently I'm just really unimpressed with the way that they progress their sounds I'm feeling a decent too strong sex on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should i review next and that's it I want to give a shout out to Alexander 180k thank you Rick Moranis good luck on your new album and this dude here's a straw only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan oh fuck buttons ever you "},{"id":"VUUxtEQLAiQ","title":"Kendrick Lamar- good kid, m.A.A.d. city ALBUM REVIEW","y":9,"x":"hi Bert hi everyone Anthony Fantana here thank you for watching Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Kendrick Lamar good kid maad city the student is a compton rapper this is his sophomore full-length album the follow-up to last year's section.80 which is one of my favorite hip hop albums of 2011 and it's a conscious hip hop album that does not sacrifice grape flows production catchy hooks stellar wordplay and personality in the process of developing a very relevant and this is a socially aware message and it does this through a series of short stories in the tracks lyrics that kind of come together thematically by the end of the album though Kendrick has a lot of great qualities as a rapper what I thought was so awesome about section 80 is how conceptual the album was and that was a characteristic about him and his music that I just was hoping he would not let go of as he kind of went into later albums and I'm actually really happy to say that being conceptual is one of the artistic personality traits of Kendrick that has gotten stronger there are a good handful of tracks from this album that had been released before the release of this LP including swimming pools backseat freestyle Compton the art of peer pressure as well but none of it really makes total sense until the entire albums being listened to from beginning to end just kind of standing back getting a glimpse at the bigger picture of things as far as lyrics on this LP go they're just on point track after track after track none of the flows really feel elementary or anything like that and though some songs may feel a little more shallow on the surface than others it may depend on the kind of character that Kendrick is playing on the song for example the track backseat freestyle you've got Kendra kind of wrapping very braggadocious Leo over this banger beat about is growing as big as the Eiffel Tower it is just completely over-the-top ridiculous if you're familiar with this kids music it's just really out of character for him but if you look into the voicemail messages occurring after and before the track and the music that comes before and after the track it becomes apparent that Kendrick right now is in the backseat of a car chilling with his friends just kind of being as loud and obnoxious as they are as they're all hanging out together right after backseat freestyle you get the track the art of peer pressure which is kind of like an internal monologue with Kendrick where yeah he's hanging out with his friends and he's having you know this good time on the outside but in fact he's kind of doing all this stuff that is out of character for him whether it be doing drugs running up on people robbing houses things he wouldn't normally find himself doing if he wasn't hanging out with people who see themselves successfully living this gangster lifestyle and with this track it becomes even more interesting and ironic that on backseat freestyle how he's rapping about how he would love all this money and power living this lifestyle he's as far away from that as one could possibly imagine good kid maad city is pretty much a story of love lust violence the violence that you're surrounded with kind of sucking you in the violence you're surrounded with tearing your family apart and finally the realization of where a violent path can kind of bring you in life which is where a song like real comes in toward the end of this LP and pretty much every track on this album adds to that narrative like the track poetic justice which is kind of like a love song Kendrick sees himself and like this love fantasy with this girl that's mentioned toward the beginning of the album sharain but at the end of the track Kendrick ends up getting jumped by two cousins of hers at that moment Kendrick kind of sees himself violently snapped back into a harsh reality after seeing hey you know like living this life isn't really so bad things are going pretty well I'm in love I see money coming my way which is kind of another fantasy Kendrick sees himself in the midst of on the track money trees right before poetic justice after these two songs it's two of the grittiest tracks this entire LP good kid and mad city that become really sobering the first of which Kendrick is talking about the death of his uncle he's talking about racial profiling for police officers and the track mad city takes a look at that same violence but for more of a retrospective angle with Kendrick kind of rapping about a younger version of himself and on that track he actually takes a completely different inflection with his voice rapping where his voice is cracking like this whether it's from emotion or maybe even puberty if he's trying to be a younger version of himself either way it's just really chilling and the old-school sound of that retrospective angle is embraced even more as there is a beat change toward the middle of the track you do get some self-aware spots on this album where you have Kendrick kind of rapping about his current self outside of this storyline like bitch don't kill my vibe where he's kind of rapping about his fame and sort of where he sees his artistic vision going as he gets more attention on his music and sort of how his message is ultimately what's going to be most important to him and the song singing about me is really one of the most interesting songs I've ever heard where a rapper is is literally writing about his art and his career in such a way where it's impacting the people who listen to it or the people he raps about I mean he literally does verses on this song referencing people who kind of work inspirations for music on this album and his previous LP - in a way the song is kind of like another layer of narrative to this album itself it's kind of like an epilogue in a way and the song Compton the the closing track to this LP it's kind of like a celebratory song just talking about the area where this story takes place it's kind of like the song that if you really do take this album as being a story it's it's the track that really kind of plays as the credits are rolling now as far as the production goes on this LP it is sonically inconsistent but I do think overall it's great but the reason I say sonically inconsistent is that you know the sounds on this LP change up as much as the scenes and just sort of the moods of these tracks do you know that the sounds most definitely fit the story Kendrick is trying tell her where he is in the progression of this tale the opening track show rain is just really nocturnal it's really dark and it's completely fitting for what kind of seems to be a night drive to his girlfriend's house you know going to meet her talking about being with her what brought him up until this point and basically the point at which he is about to get jumped and then just kind of cuts the song backseat freestyle is perfect for the braggadocious rhymes that kendrick spits over that song and is fitting for the outward personality that he has as he's doing these things he finds to be very outside of his character the song is basically a portrait of that face that people put on when they want to be hard they want to fit in they want to be perceived to be tough the best the greatest but the other side of that song is the art of peer pressure and the beat on there is really spacious very quiet it's meant to sound as internal as the thoughts that Kendrick is spinning all over that track the thoughts that he doesn't really want to express because of the people that are surrounding him money trees poetic justice sound really dreamy really fantasy sonically there's like this oasis there this place you want to be but good kid maad city just kind of like I said earlier snap things back into reality they're much darker grittier hard-hitting I believe the track swimming pools was the first to drop from this LP it's a song I wasn't totally hot on at first but it has totally grown on me it's got kind of a synthetic vibe to it synthetic drums betta keyboards and there are a lot of traps style high hats going out there at the track it feels really smooth kind of watery like you could dive into it just like the metaphorical swimming pool full of alcohol that Kendrick is rapping about that you know people figuratively used to kind of douse their pain douse their sorrows basically deal with this terrible situation surrounding them in a really unhealthy way and I love the sound of the Just Blaze beat on that closing track Compton I mean the horns on the track sound fantastic the talkbox vocals at the very end are nice too again the sound of the instrumental is just always really logical in terms of what's being said in the lyrics and I love that you know in just the sound quality the music of these instrumentals are great to some feature some pretty nice piano pieces some string pieces as well nice background vocalists and the features on here pretty great too not they're spending the best verses of all time but what I love about this LP is like the beats Kendrick is very careful about placing certain people in certain places so that it works j-rok is in a perfect spot on the salim dre is placed perfectly on this LP too with the track compton of course and even drake finds himself fitting nicely into this album I mean stylistically Drake and Kendrick are two very different artists and yet Drake fits like a glove into the love song on this album every emcee helps Kendrick not really tell this story directly but they further the feeling of the song with whatever they're saying as far as hip-hop albums go and just albums in general this this thing has almost everything I look for you know has a great concept great lyrics great instrumentals sound I think the only weak spot that Kendrick has on this LP something that continues to kind of be a weak spot for him are just the hooks but I have to admit that this LP is a nice improvement hook wise over what I heard on section 80 poetic justice has kind of a corny vocal on the hook the song reel where you know cutting I'm really really real the hook is just really really just vapid while I do like the sentiment of the song I really kind of feel like no forethought went into that chorus and there are moments where Kendrick is singing on here in this really weird inflection it's kind of robotic and while it did hit me as being pretty strange at first it really grew on me pretty heavy by my third or fourth listen to this LP I'm really impressed with this LP I mean I love it I think it's fantastic I think Kendrick has made his profound quality you know that quality that he has to bring a strong message to his music even better you know he's he's evolved that he's brought it to the next level and yet he's done it by not being preachy not beating listeners over the head with some kind of you know cause very direct message he's done it through allegory anecdotes a combination of fiction and nonfiction that if you listen to it hard enough to get the bigger picture get the narrative and just hear the story it's most likely going to have a bigger impact on you bbbb I'm pretty much feeling a light to decent night on this album what did you think of it if you've listened to it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next

she got favorite of the three out of the three yes but just just that energy is still there man it is it is just such a it's a treat man it's true it's crazy to see you know LP and kill a mic in their you know their their chemistry throughout this thing man it's just it's basically they found that that groove now you know and it's just like it's everything that I expect it to be and just a little bit more and it just like the messages came right on time you know just what the uh was it a social commentary the political aspect of it as well as when they were talking about was just really well done on their part on both killer Mike and LPS part and just a production it's just in fucking sane it just it's crazy as far as um political commentary this is definitely the project of the three that is oh yeah the most with oh yeah oh yeah for sure don't get captured to Thebes into a twenty one hundred oh yeah then kind of um a little bit on everybody stay calm and oh mama and circling back to that a really big way on the closing track to yeah yeah what I was like who you master yeah that's revolutionary shit there man I was unreal unreal yeah they were trying to push that revolutionary angle on ya these lyrics here first oh yeah oh sure you know meanwhile that that's really a lot of the second half of the record for the first record it's really just kind of like run the bases yeah exactly they get exactly just you know kicking the raps man it was funny you know witty all the book I mean killing Mike in LP just doing what they do best man it scene is just just killing the game man killing the game had me cracking up and just with the of course the production would LP and his group manages it's crazy is a crazy mix you know and they have that you know that that that that sound you know that signature sound it's not like some regular ol like trap shit it's like it's definitely a run to Jules type of sound that I'm used to at this point yeah it's maybe see it's heavy it's very authentic it's definitely a banger quality to it but it's not like just anybody else's banger that are out there today you know a definitely exact zone sound it has some groove it has some vibe yeah oh I will show that the first half of the record to me was near flawless the exception of the intro track yeah it was very columns like it was very like you know it was very comfy you know intro track to run the jewels to was not like this hard-hitting like we're fun it's just you know guns blazing from the gates but it was dark heavy kind of ominous song you know it was like down I feel like really kind of failed to set any kind of tone you know wow it's kind of felt like a spacey kind of non track but then when talked to me started that to me really fast yeah that was intro that that was the fucking intro third album it like went down he was talking about of course you know going through um you know just he could have fell off they both could have fell off but you know you know overcoming and I guess it's kind of like an like it I don't know a prelude to what's gonna come I guess I don't know what you can even call it that but it's basically a very calm moment and probably only calm moment on the album I mean once it takes off it takes off and it does it stop oh it's crazy it does in the first moment where it's like I mean talk to me and legend has it great tracks don't run the jewels oh yeah to their strengths at this point alien it's not really for the first half of this record nothing too experimental or adventurous they're just kind of giving you what they do best but then when call to curtain comes in that's really weird beat for them don't you think it yeah right kind of busiest it's really Nettie there's like a lot going on it kind of reminded me of like some I don't like some Timberland type of shit like Missy Elliott's I've shared as far as just how the appreciations were going and stuff it's just it had that energy to it I actually would love to see that like live honestly that would be kind of nuts but yeah it's just like this weird like switch up in it I loved it I loved that you know that's right yeah it definitely added like some good diversity to the first yeah parse or Kurd then we had hey kids with Danny Brown which was a campaign yeah that opening line yeah my Twitter page which was really sick yeah said he's a word architect and he arcs the tech and any party yeah neck oh yeah I thought like a good Alec gently out of like eternal rhymes in one bar that was sick as for sure for sure it was indeed indeed ready they did a damn good job of that one like this that little was an example of the beginning kind of summed up how I felt that oh my god this is crazy yeah that's what I felt the shit out of that because I was thinking oh my god it's just everybody stop and it doesn't of course no I lost my shit I lost my shit I mean shortly after you feel that way that's when like the album sort of falls into that kind of low and gets kind of yeah oh yeah things down a lot I mean our gold is a decent track I mean there are some cuts on here and that is one of them where it just kind of feels like wow there's a player to your strengths it is a little deja vu in a way huh for sure for sure but absolutely don't get captured comes in like the tone really changes like it's not yeah mess that they get political it's then the beats get way more Spacey and yes it yak - yeah and arias yeah what did you think about them sort of going down that road in general do you think they did it as well as they could have done it taking a more moody angle with their song absolute the fact that the jewels is like typically this aggressive regress yeah children oh I think they did a good job of painting a picture you know as far especially with LPS first on that track but it's like it seemed like he's kind of taking like in the perspective of a police officer that's you know that's kind of you know crooked in a way I guess you could say that was that was really like it was kind of disturbing but it was it works you know as far as what type of picture they were trying to you know paint they keep going like throughout you know what said with that one and then thieves and did I was like 2100 they kind of you know hold that kind of life you know it's like if it like a dire situation and that's why I think what they're trying to you know paint it's a really fucked up situation you know that's going on and you know lyrically I really liked those tracks especially with what they were doing on thieves because thieves know track that to me was probably the most well thought-out and console you lyrics you know oh yeah oh yeah with that this picture of how the news media portrays oh yeah but we're sort of rioting and responses to and profit from this brutality that they're rapping yeah their songs oh yeah you know but like I'm not sure if like LPS production really lent itself to this more easygoing moody Spacey style you know especially with the bass lines kind of being I don't know a little uninspired just like kind of ascending descending just a couple notes and it's like uh you know yeah it's like you guys are still trying to put together something boo me and and and laughs but also shook trying to be moody at the same time and it's like I feel like they could have like um I don't know I think they kind of workshop it a little bit more because I think the song Thursday in the Danger Room with Kumasi Washington's horns yeah and on that check that was definitely a great example of them going short direction we also think everybody stay calm was a great example of them going that yeah there was little mood yeah little yes be and 2262 you know who I love hearing boots on that track again you know his vocals you know do add a ton of melody to that track you know whenever he does collaborate with them I was kind of surprised to see oh they're going back to boots again you know for a new project but like once I heard the song I was like yeah you know it makes sense it's yeah they work together well yeah for sure for sure I think that um I think what this the strongest aspect of those tracks are is basically the narrative and what they're trying to push and honestly that's that was okay for me you know I'm saying as far as just how the beats a good suffers you know are kind of different and kind of Moody but I think it's a part of that picture that they're trying to push you know and it makes sense to me at least that'll make sense the the song Panther like a panther that song sir yes out in the second half because it yet got kind of like you know Cheney goes medical it's like it goes back when you use these moodier tracks for too long no how did that song strike you sort of at this point on the album well for one I realized that Trina was on it which is hella random to be like Trina that's crazy you know fucking Trina it I mean she's not like wrapping it and she's on the hook but it's cool though it was really cool it's like a nice little break from the yield of doom and gloom I guess you could say yeah but I'll you know it works it fits in it in its you know in the against consistency of the project itself hmm no I mean I think it's a good change of pace like you just said although it is another one of those moments where it just kind of hits me is like okay you guys aren't really like pushing forward or anything at this point it's just kind of feels yeah another like song that could have been on run the jewels too you know and that's the thing there are a couple tracks on here that to me felt like they could just snugly fit into that album um you know especially uh kill your masters with the Zack de la Rocha yeah although yeah probably the one moment on the record where the lyrics get the most revolutionary yeah no shit oh god yeah massive and yeah I don't know it's like a report to the shareholders was probably another moment where I didn't care for the production as much right right the weird kind of switch up from one beat to another because it is kind of like a two-part track yeah was really interesting to me you know sort of like in the way that down didn't feel like the the most necessary intro like me didn't really fit as the most necessary outro it almost felt like the beautiful horns and kind of the the finality of Thursday in the danger room also also like felt like a closer to me you know it was also like talk to me was it was the opener and Thursday was the closer and I wouldn't get rid of kill your masters I think it's a great absolutely not but yeah it could have fit like in the first half easy and could have actually brought that revolutionary vibe throughout the whole record that's probably an option I actually kind of like the placement of ugh was like a ambassador but if anything I would have probably have cut it into a certain like an actual separate track itself and not have to be after you know share order if you know if anything but honestly yeah it fits I think best probably in the second half just to end on that kind of you know that high note really yeah so actually I like that aspect you know definitely you know because I have to kind of at least be a little critical of the record I mean those are crucial issues with the record but oh yeah all those issues I feel like I am being at least a little nitpicky because I mean everything that's been good about run the jewels up until this point boom which carries over onto this record oh yeah man like oh yeah the chemistry between LP and killer Mike which to me really kind of reached its apex on run the jewels to ingest is good here you know on the furniture to kind of felt like they were still getting used to each other but on the second one it was just like flames and on this yeah yeah they really kind of tried to show how dynamic they could be like she really could still like drop another run the jewels to a collection of Iglesia tracks that makes it hard but oh yeah given you know there were a few moments on the last record where it seemed like they were trying to make some political points and no songs did do pretty well like especially with that an incredible music video they did with that song with Zack de la Rocha with yeah sort of that black-and-white film of the yes or in the guy sort of you know in endless battle mm-hmm it's like they really tried to go down that political route further which yeah you know is sort of a in a way could be very natural because of sort of how political killer Mike is on his own for sure oh yeah yeah going down that road wouldn't be weird for them at all nah not at all so again it seems like they're trying to show how dynamic they can be on here um and for the most part I would say they definitely succeeded yes men me too absolutely absolutely they did a damn good job in the aspect so I mean as far as the lyrics and the production it's like again it's just really much just really very much a continuation of run the jewels to in terms of the quality personality wit you know humor yeah LP and killer Mike - yep shine through again yes indeed what was that one line that LP said about like kids roasting s'mores over like the crotches of his enemies or something yeah Oh hilarious yes he had a bunch of them actually been oh he was uh he was on I was one um Stay Gold yeah one that stuck out to be a lot when he said I was like piss on power golden shower if it's some crazy shit man just he just kept going on this scheme of just you know gold which was just kind of tight to be you know really cool yeah that's you know that's what he does awesome he like grabs a concept or grabs an idea at the beginning of a verse and just sort of like go he just it's like a gauntlet of references today I'm telling you a idea that what big it's so first like he's really excellent at that I'm telling you man Oh telly hmm so I mean outside of that uh so again well you know this is like the best of the three records in European yes indeed so what sort of inches this album beyond run the jewels to in your opinion you know is it well variety is it political sort of charged I think it's it's the variety and the they're like the political charge like I'm saying like they're the pushing up towards us narrative that needs to be talked about you know and I think that they did a good job at doing it I kind of had a feeling that kill him I was gonna go this route because you know he's been in the news lately you know and I just felt that you know their chemistry and their two different points of view kind of you know it kind of shines through on album on you know shedding light on to this situation you know with politics and you know the government and you know what's in the situation that are going on today you know just with police brutality and you know the police shootings and the riots and what-have-you so I think they did a good job that actually you know pushing force that narrative you know in a way when it doesn't really come off as preachy but just kind of just you know showing you know people what's going on and you're talking about it yeah it doesn't really come off as too preachy and I would say that Thebes is probably the one track where it seems like the flows come off really clunky especially with how you have one line come out and then there's like a line being set in the background sort of in that yeah yeah it's kind of quality yeah like they just had a lot to say on that song like and it's it's like a really intense thing to try to talk about and all yeah Jon would track that explains it well right oh so it's like there are obviously moments on here where the that challenge I think got the best of them a little bit but yeah like songs like 2100 and we stay calm and kill your masters still come on like really fluidly really naturally they don't come off preachy you know and just sound like just as good in his quality and it's hard-hitting and as instantaneous as any run the jewels track that we've enjoyed so far show Michelle definitely what I like oh god what were you going to say I was going to talk about I like the fact that I was named killer Michael in 2100 when he was talking about the situations even though you know he's painting a really downward you know spiral of chaos really he's basically saying you know you still gotta keep hope alive basically type of deal because if in fact you know you lose hope then I guess you know evil takes over you lose itself is based yeah which is it's you know just those like little simple things that are in this are in these tracks it kind of you know they kind of kids home with me you know me um so tell me what your uh your final thoughts are on this record you know like you would you know in your reaction because obviously yours yeah for this video for show yeah Bansal my final verdict is simple BAM uh the beats are there um the lyrics are there killing Mike LP got this crazy mystery okay um I love the political aspect of this album I love the fact that you know they are pushing forth their own there to this well and some of these tracks with uh what's that um was it Thursday in the Danger Room mm-hmm that was really that was some deep stuff man talking about you know losing them a friend rather till you know violence or also losing a friend you know because of illnesses you know from LPS perspective I really love the fact that they're pushing out the wrong little stories there too and you know teaching people you know are showing people how they would cope with the situation also forgiving people that may have you know killed their loved ones I love the fact that you know they show they're very dynamic in this one as well so I'd say very simple simple enough if you've actually watch if you listen to uh run the jewels wanted to and you love those that I guarantee you're gonna love this one so I say the people who have listed run the jewels one run to us to go ahead cop this album for sure for those who haven't listened to run the jewels go ahead listen to running two is one and one through em burn the jewels to see how you like those and definitely go ahead and check out running jewels three and for those who may not like LP and kill them I for whatever reason that maybe I still say go ahead and give this a listen for sure definitely give us a listen there's some tracks on here that you may like definitely okay for me uh this is to me just as quality has run the jewels to but just don't go into this album expecting a similar experience you know this is a more mature album this is a more thoughtful album at points this is a more contemplative album you know it's a more cerebral record again it's not just that relentless high-octane hard-hitting you know explosion happening in the background as LP and killer Mike are flying in slow motion forward at you sort of experience that run the jewels to is you know there's some serious very serious topics sort of being explored and talked about in the second half of this album and sometimes you know I think killer and Mike a killer Mike and LP go through some growing pains trying to express some legitimate feelings and thoughts on these issues you know and even if I think these songs occasionally do falter in a musical way or actual way the lyrics are there the narratives are there the performances you know the emotional performances and everything are definitely there you know so I can't take that away from them at all you know and actually like there were some songs that once I read deeper into what was being said they sort of clicked a little bit more than they did initially when I was like oh this one kind of sounds weird to them you know weird for them you know for the most part the first half of the record you know with the exception of the intro which I for whatever reason no matter how many times I listen to this record it just seems more and more unfitting as the intro track on the first half of the record is great it's just one hard-hitting song after another there's not really a song or a moment I would take away from this album as being like totally lackluster or unnecessary other than just kind of like a few spots at the very beginning and the very end so you know it's just like another quality record from run the jewels in my opinion and you know they continue to sort of push forward the envelope of hardcore hip-hop you know there aren't too many artists out there who are taking hardcore hip-hop and you know because this in a lot of ways is hardcore hip-hop when you look at the the the lyrical content here when you look at the political content when you look at the the sort of emotion that the beats try to evoke out of the listener like this is hardcore hip-hop all the way and yet it sounds nothing like anything hardcore hip-hop has done up until this point you know and that's been all run the jewels one run out a little to run the jewels three while this album in some respects may seem a little safe for them because they've kind of established this sound and they're sticking to it on this record for the most part they're doing it as quality as they would you know on run the jewels to and on run the jewels one you know so this is by far not a disappointment at all what I loved him to push the envelope a little bit more sonically sure but they definitely did politically and they definitely did narrative wise on this record this to me is easily you know like a strong 7 to a light 8 definitely to be one of the better hop hip hop records of well I mean it's obviously one of the best better hip hop records of 2016 you know sure I am sure that they came out gladness at the tail end of the year so this is probably just going to end up on my 2017 list off big so uh because err I already came out with my 2016 list yeah you know as a lot of people have pointed out you know they're like Anthony what are you gonna do they already came out with a doctor advised your whole list now you totally fucked up dude you didn't well tell I'll tell you I waited in um I think it'll probably end up somewhere in there maybe we'll see we'll see good but uh yeah I'll definitely enjoy the shattered his album man I love this one this is a really good job okay man yeah well that has been our review of this record thanks for coming Oh talking with me about it man oh man not a problem any time any time all right I got a good win big quint

everyone my canoe off Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rae sremmurd album Shrem worse REM REM life 3 the third one the third commercial album they've dropped as I've said this is the third full-length commercial album from from from from sway Lee and slim Jimmy aka Rae sremmurd and not only is this thing their third full-length album but it's also separated into three discs the first part is a collaborative effort from the duo's respective members sway and Jimbo and then after that the whole album splits off into two separate discs with each member kind of taken over a disc sort of like in a Speakerbox love below kind of situation they're really the outcasts of the trapped generation now when going into this three disc Odyssey I was kind of torn because in one breath I liked the duo second album quite a bit it wasn't amazing but it wasn't terrible either had a lot of great single tracks on there like black beetles and start a party shake it fast with Juicy J and look alive there were a lot of great forward-thinking kind of cutting-edge weirdly produced rap bangers on that thing that played to the duo's boyish delivery and style their their youthful aura and honestly even though this was not a perfect project I could kind of see the duo going up from here creatively maybe not in a lyrical sense but maybe more with them kind of finding out ways to write weird or catchy or songs so I did have that in my mind going into this triple disc experience but then again it is three discs of music from race Rimmer who we already know going into this thing don't have the artistic versatility or the lyrical fortitude to handle an entire 100 minutes of music and keep it interesting from start to finish maybe their chances of pulling through are better than that of me goes on culture too but still the odds are kind of stacked against slim Jimmy and Anse way now still there are some great tracks on this project with sticky production and super catchy hooks charismatic vs. decent features as well however most of these songs land on the first disc of the prod we're sway and Jimmy are pretty much greater than the sum of their parts hey kind of like you and me best friends forever two peeps in a pack you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray there's no good especially when Jimmy and sway are on top of these Mike will made it beats that feature some co-production from the likes of tm88 rock 30 Zito vain' Metro boomin and many many many many many many more there are plenty of highlights on the first disc like the song up in my cocina which has a very eerie atmosphere on it banger track beat some very like suspended creepy like horror movie synthesizers jimmy and sway come through with those boyish vocals dropping these super laid-back chill flows braggadocious rhymes with very absurd and playful references another highlight for me on this thing is buckets featuring future another total banger back with these sour kind of disjointed piano keys fumbling their way underneath one of the most cutthroat verses that Jimmy drops on the entire project futures appearance on this thing is relatively solid I mean I don't know if you have to try rapping too hard to sound impressive or sound like a doing a good job on a race rumored album but he certainly sounds like he's doing the bare minimum I love the song 42 if not just for its instrumental its flow and it's strange European sizing references in the hook it sounds like experimental obscure lo-fi 8-bit soundcloud trap the song Powerglide featuring Juicy J is another highlight on here truly psychedelic enveloping song super dark super surreal and Twp is even a song that even though I wasn't crazy about it as a single it did grow on me a little bit the first disc on this thing has a great vibe to a lot of solid tracks I mean it's not perfect by any means there are a few low points the song closed featuring Travis Scott would be a total waste of time if not for the instrumental in the Travis Scott feature has one of the most obnoxious hooks on the entire record you see a no se you see a Louis E to me perplexing pegasus while I do love the flows and the instrumental on this they don't really do too much with it there's not a necessary hook on this song at all it just kind of feels like they strike a vibe and they just kind of leave it there until the track is over and bedtime stories featuring the weakened this has to be able zwarst feature ever he's literally mumble singing his way through the song I guess you know there is mumble rap he's he's pretty much invented mumbles singing here but still considering all the pros and cons of the first disc it's still a pretty decent listen I mean I would say it's a strong 6 to a 7 it's mostly on par with everything shred has done up until this point it's on the following two solo efforts that things start getting really rough especially on vacation which if you are familiar with sway Lee's contributions to Rae sremmurd in the past you can probably go into this disc assuming that this is gonna be the more melodic atmospheric and smooth of the trio and ding-ding-ding you would be right but it is the most excruciating listen of this three disc experience because for the most part it doesn't even sound written it just sounds like sways vocally riffing over these spacey trap beats and that's it there's very little in the way of anything that sounds like a finely crafted tuner that it was even preconceived it's so impromptu not only are the performances on this disc super weak especially on the song red wine which features one of the most awkward vocal performances on this entire thing it's like suede didn't even know what he wanted to do going into the track but I can't imagine how anything on this record was even drafted because at a certain point when you've drafted the song Guatamala for the fifth time you had to have realized that this is a really tasteless attempt and trying to fuse trap with Latin pop not only down to the melodies and the generic bead but the trash lyrics honestly the second disc of this thing in my opinion is absolutely horrendous and one of the worst listens I've had this year of anything and all things considered I pretty much feel like a strong one on it now the final disc of this thing handled by slim Jimmy the Jim trow is better measurably than sway keishon but not by much it has its shortcomings as well because while it does hit harder it has meteor instrumentals a lot of which again are brought by Mike will made it with some co-production and Jimmy's delivery on this thing is definitely more attention-grabbing and aggressive than what's way offers on sway casein he's not so versatile a rapper they can handle 30 minutes of a disc on his own even with a few features and keep it interesting I actually think separating him away from sway highlights just how little personality as an individual artist he has because there's a number of tracks on this thing where he sounds like Young Jeezy for some reason but like even Young Jeezy when he was younger had a very husky raspy voice it's like Jimmy kind of strikes that same tone but he's almost like a pre puberty Young Jeezy and that's not when he doesn't have tracks on this thing where he sounds exactly like good act black especially on the song changed up I feel like he's essentially written a good code act black song here which is just baffling to me like you already kind of had this established sound and style as a member of Rae sremmurd I feel like sway for the most part kind of stuck to what you would expect from him on a solo venture whereas like Jimmy on his own it's like he's got no rudder no direction especially on tracks like keep God first I mean without sway there to kind of swoop in and drop a great hook there's no chorus there it's just super tedious mush and the features on this final disc are kind of rough too I mean if you have a lot of respect for Pharrell and you want to keep it I would skip his appearance and then zoe kravitz of all people is on this thing who I just enjoyed hearing on the news you know Monet album but she has a rap feature on this disc and it sounds like a bad SNL skit it sounds like Natalie Portman rapping like posturing and trying to sound super aggressive it's super tough yeah I did not get it at all it just sounded like a satire which I mean maybe the last two discs of this album are in a way of something I don't know it's I I haven't quite figured out what it's a social commentary on but certainly certainly the the the the point was made I think yeah I think after this thing unequivocally I can say that Jimmy and sway work better together hearing each of them respectively on their own disc of this three disc album is kind of like looking into the mirror and not seeing your reflection even if I am feeling like maybe a strong four to a light five on Jimmy's disk again better than sways but not by that much and bringing together all of my scores for all of the disks I think I'm feeling just like a strong 4 on this record overall and those are my thoughts on this unnecessarily long super bloated 3 disc Rae sremmurd album I mean if you took the best songs on the entire thing and condense that down into one single disc and maybe forced a few more collaborations out of Jimi and sway I think it would have been a pretty good album maybe their best yet but instead I feel like they've given in to this temptation towards stream trolling and have just kind of thrown out these haphazard side projects just to kind of rack up more more plays and and that's a transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which a tire view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the

alright yeah these guys are a swedish instrumental experimental and psychedelic rock band who pretty much where their influences on their sleeves when it comes to the title of this debut album of theirs while this collective is a rock band at heart they kind of lilypad from one musical culture to another as they transition from one Jam to another across these nine tracks the band moves from tribal drum circles to Afrobeat grooves to what kind of seems like very windy desert rock that would definitely fit the bill of a band like tonari when to an extent this band is able to paint some musical portraits of foreign lands with not much more than guitars drums vocals with a little keyboard and saxophone added on as well however this fans approach to world music isn't exactly authentic or rootsy or anthropological in nature in fact it is pretty gentrified with lots of guitar distortion elements of psychedelic rock and this modern indie band lo-fi style recording and I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing these guys are definitely taking these influences and twisting them to their own slightly punked-out whims I'm just saying I don't think world music purists are gonna see much use in this record the angle that this album will most likely see success with are with people who are into Garage and psychedelic rock and are kind of seeing this element of African music or middle-eastern music through in as kind of an interesting piece of novelty I personally would not call myself a world music purist but I do think the way that this band incorporated a lot of these foreign elements into their garage and psychedelic rock is is kind of flimsy I don't want to say these guys haven't listened to a lot of world music because of course I don't know what they have her head now listened to but to me a lot of tracks on here whether it's because of a lack of musicianship or just a lack of experience are really able to move past the musical stereotypes of the genre or the style of music that goat is trying to infuse into this mix of psychedelic and garage rock take the songs let it bleed and disco fever for example two tracks on here that are clearly influenced by afro beat and and really kind of embrace the genre tightly to the point where the band's psychedelic rock influences aren't really at the forefront but when it comes to afro beer just generally African rock the rhythm guitars the beats the vocal melody - it's it's all pretty generic there's nothing electrifying about what they have written on these tracks or really how they're playing them together I don't really get a lot of fire from hearing these guys play these songs out and kind of jam them and the thing is I don't really feel like they do either because if they did they would certainly string these songs out longer than just kind of an average length wouldn't they I mean the longest track on here is just under eight minutes and it's the last song and as this track kind of pads itself out its delivering all these very kind of lazily improvised organ notes that don't really add up to much however I do like the ending of the track which is pretty explosive with the theme melody of that song and the opening track it's really one of the more ambitious parts on this LP just you know kind of ambition I was showed up a bit more however I will not say this album is completely underwhelming or uninteresting I do think the fusion of influences and just genres that go has put together on this LP is a pretty good idea there are moments on here like goatman they have some pretty strong wah guitars and fuzz bass some chanting and African drums to me the track works so well conceptually that it just feels like these styles of music were meant to be together the song go ahead kind of ends up entertaining me for similar reasons despite some slightly flat singing and the track goat lord is is actually kind of a piece of psychedelic folk very mystical actually slightly pretty ethereal spacious it's kind of the album's cooled down before the very burning closer overall I mean I was pretty indifferent on this LP to be completely honest I was excited at first because with just the mix of sounds that I was hearing but as I do further into this album just the lack of musicianship and just musical ideas had me just feeling very cold and because that's not there this album merely functions on some interesting sounds textures and just the novel idea of just these two musical worlds coming together and that does work to an extent but just not so far for me that I ended up liking the LP I'm kind of feeling a strong two decent five on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next

new Travis Scott record rodeo oh yeah Travis Scott is a southern rapper and producer who sort of blew up came out of nowhere as a kanye protege earning a few production credits on Kanye's last big commercial release Jesus and after earning this Kanye West bump Travis Scott did not take his time with releasing his own music right there in 2013 he had it ready that Owl Pharaoh EP mixtape project I thought this project was like just wall-to-wall dull and if Kanye was grifting any ideas off of Travis in the studio they were being altered to the point of like being nearly unrecognizable if they were landing on on yeezus either that are just given like this really high gloss finish so that they sounded just a little bit more commercial project ready I guess the owl Farrow stuff maybe the budget wasn't as high I don't know on Travis's following project days before rodeo this was the big teaser mixtape bringing us to this rodeo project he did very little of the production on here at least from what I can tell from the credits which at that point what like why like what what do you what are you doing here like aren't you supposed to be the superstar producer why are you not producing on your own records I just didn't get it because he certainly wasn't bringing it on the rapping and the lyricism just the flow side of things Travis wasn't really coming across as this superstar really great attention grabbing voice as far as sound quality goes days before rodeo definitely sounded better but at this point I just didn't really see Travis's potential like with days before rodeo and with a low fare oh I I thought the catchiest thing Travis had written was that pretty cool straight up ad-lib even with his 3500 single which featured 2 Chainz and in future I thought the production was heavy it was pretty luscious Travis's bars didn't really blow me away or anything that future and to chain sorta did their thing it sounded decent the hook was definitely stand out but the song standing at seven minutes I think really killed its single potential so admittedly I wasn't really that excited for this project but then I read into the production credits on this thing which you can see here and they are pretty impressive as you can see some pretty awesome names listed out in this thing including Wonder Girl and Pharrell and then I caught the features list which had Kanye West even Justin Bieber quavo of me goes to chains at future as I said Ti does some of the like really strange dramatic spoken-word bits on the album here Juicy J and Toro y Moi who Travis has done music with before land on this record too so interest piqued and while I don't think this record is perfect I do feel like Travis has come into his own a great deal on this album and I hear a specific idea and sound and kind of concept coming through on Rodeo I think Travis has essentially taken that new Atlanta sound from artists like future and og MACO and me goes from young thug and to an extent Chief Keef all of the druggie lyrics the trap influenced percussion the kind of wavy slow-mo sounds the auto-tune the hedonism the the ballads the singing and also the kind of gimmicky ad-libs in the background I think he's taken a little bit of a cue from the last ASAP ferg album trap Lord as well with some of the very cavernous production some of the very deep and and gorgeous reverbs that are on some of these vocals here but mostly Travis is borrowing from and focusing on this this new generation of Atlanta bass artists and he's kind of grabbing their respective sound which he's always been influenced by to a great degree being from Houston himself I mean he's he's probably deep into the world of southern hip-hop there's no doubt about that so he's grabbing this sound and he's kind of elevating it to this really beautiful artsy level and really making it kind of album worthy like this style of music I think has led to a lot of great singles a lot of smash singles a lot of club bangers some decent mixtapes too but rarely are these very same artists actually delivering commercial records that live up to the hype of these singles recently I could think of futures dirty sprite - as an example which for what it was doing sounded like a very aesthetically cohesive record kind of artsy in its own right with all of its very woozy druggie slow-mo sounds but futures singing and rapping and lyricism has its limitations future is not that great of a lyricist he's not even really a good singer the tracks didn't really develop in the way that you would want a good song to develop but development is what Travis has plenty of on rodeo surprisingly Travis actually NAB's the the melody from futures rich sex go back and listen to that track and then listen to the second half of the song oh my and and this side it's the same goddamn melody but Travis actually extends it out a little bit and turns it into a tune and not just this redundant dumb down melodic phrase that gets tiresome by the time the song is over the singing on this track even though it is heavily auto-tuned and on the the first half with the song oh my it's very expressive it's not like the auto-tune is just kind of covering up all the human elements of the voice Travis uses auto-tune in a really effective manner throughout this record only in a few moments do I think it actually because is to the detriment of this record record record and this track oh my / decide actually features one of Travis as many beat shifts right in the middle of the song and while in the past I didn't really enjoy what he was doing with these beat shifts because we were just going from one weak idea to another weak idea I think on this record I actually started to enjoy it not because the B shifts were all that well orchestrated sometimes like on the song night oh two one oh they're kind of weak like we just kind of get this fade up of the next beat seems a little you know thrown together but at least the respective halves the respective sides to each song the the track we're transitioning from and the in the track we're transitioning to our good yeah I said it and I and I seriously mean I think oh my is a fantastic song and a great start to this record it's so cavernous it's so dark it's so eerie I love the oh oh my just gives me a chilly chill chill and how we kind of move from this just very dark just nocturnal trap ballad to this very just pretty kind of glamorous trap R&B tune is very sweet it's very uh cool it's like a very warm embrace after a very dark cold freezing night both sides of this track are incredibly intoxicating potent pretty to the ear I love the intricacies of the production some of the synth leads on the second half of this track are gorgeous beautiful just really great beats on this thing and qwave owes contributions to the first half in the second half of this track are great to him and Travis actually have quite a bit of chemistry together and I like how this track is showing us different sides of Travis Scott - we had this monstrous darkness on one half of this song the whole thing kicks off with a track named pornography which kind of builds the album up to be this epic the bit of a personal story of Travis's come up and the second half of this track shows Travis being kind of personal and a little nostalgic I mean we're not exactly getting like a life story here but it certainly feels like Travis is starting to use his music to come out of his shell and say something a little bit more personal which he does again on the sec half of 90210 a moment where I actually feel quite a bit of heart coming through on Travis's lyrics over this very glamorous boom backbeat which features these really awesome grand pianos and I actually don't mind the kind of pornstar themed a ballad that kicks the whole track off I actually think it's another example of Travis taking that auto-tune backed atl balladry and kind of elevating it because if you isolate everything else out of the tune aside from the auto-tune vocals and Travis is singing lyrically the instrumental here is actually gorgeous I mean the spacious drums the the female vocals on this track are wonderful I don't know who's singing them they seem to be uncredited if you want to put that down there in the comments that would be greatly appreciated but the vocals the guest vocals on this track are wonderful they sound awesome it's kind of like I'm actually listening to this fusion of like a really tender delicate art pop song and like I don't know like a migos track or something it's crazy at this point on the record traps is coming like dangerously close to perfectly embodying that whole idea that whole notion of like high-end highbrow just high-class ignorance something I think someone like Kanye has tried to push in his music before at least the idea of that with song specifically off of like the cruel summer mixtape labor but I think Travis pulls it off maybe a little bit better because while his instrumentals and his songs do sound very melodic and very fleshed out an artsy in a sense his music still maintains like that street vibe that Street grittiness to it that I think a sort of a more established industry rapper wouldn't necessarily be able to pull off because they're not as close to that lifestyle they're not as close to that background as someone like Travis's he is just coming from that world and the sound represents that world is fresh in his mind because he's living it as a young artist one of the other things that I like about the instrumental on this track are the little layers of guitars that are very quiet but adds so much character to some of these instrumentals when they do pop up kind of like in the last third of the 3,500 instrumental a track that I'm enjoying so much more in the context of this record though I still wish it was a little shorter a little bit punchier going deeper into the tracklist we have the incredibly sinister track wasted with Juicy J I think it's really grimy it's got a lot of different parts to it I think there are maybe a few spots here that kind of feel like a bit of dead air with the instrumental and like not too much going on lyrically but you know still it's a pretty decent track at a very dark moment on the record the song pray for love with the weakened is a definitely lower point on the record for me but not because of the weekend as some of you may assume it's actually one of the few moments where I wish Travis let up on the vocal effects a little bit because Abel is a really capable singer and he can definitely hold his own he doesn't need to be so heavily layered in effects it's definitely ear grabbing at the very intro of this track but once the bridge comes in and we get the whole pleased open it's like sort of ascending vocal part and we have one vocal effect on top of another vocal effect on top of another vocal effect it just becomes too much and and I think the very nice and sharp musical arrangements that are being sort of orchestrated this bridge in the song are kind of being smothered by the fact the vocals sound so horrendous because of all the effects on every multitrack vocal still though I like the instrumental on this track - I like the dark building beat kind of reminded me of what Kanye has been doing recently on his own solo stuff and sort of makes me think you know is this the kind of artistry that Kanye wanted in his own music and that's why we're kind of seeing it come to light on this record over here is this sort of stuff Travis Scott was bringing to the table during those easiest sessions or is this just something that he's picking up because he was in on those sessions and obviously the the influence that him and Kanye have going for each other it's obviously a two-way street I think we get back to more effective songwriting on the track I call with Swale e of drummers ear I'm not pronouncing that backwards and also chief keef it is a pretty decent tune I wish it had a grander intro like many other songs here do rather than just kind of you know fading in which was a little bit of a disappointment but this track does have one of the more winning choruses on the entire record when the girls yeah I get that there's not really too much to this track lyrically you know it's not deep or anything like that but I think it kind of takes this whole notion of you know this late-night hedonism and debauchery to this really kind of very pretty woozy intoxicating sort of aesthetic again I push the idea that this is trying to make that hedonism this is trying to make that ATL sound just sound a little more melodic a little artsy ER a little bit more refined and a little bit more groomed not groomed for radio but groomed so that the flavor isn't getting lost as you listen to it from the start of an album to the end of an album sort of adding these wonderful melodic intricacies to the instrumentals so that these tracks are actually not one-dimensional channel channel so while sway Lee and Chief Keef might not exactly be saying anything deep on this track I do appreciate their verses especially chief Keef's for being as just kind of direct and is blunt as they are which is especially the case on the song piss on Your Grave which takes a little time to get started with this weird psych Rock intro but once it really begins you kind of hear Kanye's yeah a lot of people were really excited for this song because they wanted to hear Kanye it sounds a lot like a track that could have landed on uses honestly because vocally it sounds like Kanye is still going down that same road that he was on yeezus sort of that whole I am of God kind of thing which I believe is a track that Travis co-produced off Jesus and I'm not so sure if the song has a left over a lot of people have alleged that but I think Kanye is coming off way more extreme than he was on some of those uses tracks and on some of his recent features this feature seems just like way more over the top than any feature he's done as of late which in a sense I found refreshing although it did kind of feel like a bit of a temper tantrum but ultimately what does end up making this song a bit of a low point for me on the record is the songwriting wise there clearly was not as much effort here as there was on many other tracks here Travis and Kanye like trade a few bars here and there they show some decent chemistry but the song isn't really here on this track though you know again I do kind of appreciate this track for kind of the energy shift at this point in the tracklist which is something you've got to pay attention to because it's very clear that Travis put a lot of effort into the flow of this record after this song though the the hits on this album I think continue the track antidote which does have this redundant little vocal melody but I do love the beat and I love how heavy and I love how bassy it is again it's another woozy intoxicating moment it hits so hard but it feels like I'm in the midst of a dream state my one complaint about this track is that I think by the midpoint we're really struggling for lyrics we're really struggling for things to say I don't know hoes I get that we're not trying to say anything deep on this record but it at least say something catchy or memorable or something still there's some wonderful moments on this instrumental the the bridge has these wonderful synths on it and Travis's verse toward the back end of this track isn't really bad either I like the song impossible directly after which is kind of like this groovy alluring dream sequence on the record and lyrically like a bit of a monologue for Travis where he's talking about his his dreams his ambitions I guess his uh his worries his stresses it's kind of like this weird little internal monologue moment on the record and with the track Maria I'm drunk we have this beautiful little vocal intro and then immediately we go into this track with young thug and Justin Bieber song that for many is probably going to be the most hated on the record Justin Bieber young thug potentially a train wreck I mean not not really two names a lot of people want to hear on a record but songwriting wise this is one of my favorite tracks on the entire album not only is the refrain of this track killer but I think young thug's voice on this track is awesome I think a lot of people on young thug because they're holding him up to this rapper rubric when he couldn't even be further from trying to attempt to to live up to that standard I just kind of see him as a singer hey guy you been good yeah there's something about his voice that is just so dynamic and all over the place on this track that really just pulls me in and Justin Bieber when he comes on while I mean yeah it's Justin Bieber I think he fits into the aesthetic of the record really well I don't think he does anything on his verse that likes Whaley wasn't doing earlier on the record so if you just hate his verse just because it's Justin Bieber then I mean I don't really know what to tell you I'm not really in love with it it's not a high point for me on the record but he didn't stick out like a sore thumb or anything which is maybe all I could have really asked for Justin he just wants to know what that booty do I in a dreary little piano line and that freaking is Sydney bass line up boom boom boom both awesome both good and the record finishes off relatively strong to the very evil and melodic I can tell is haunting very haunting and the song apple pie is kind of like a warm goodbye with Travis kind of saying farewell to his mother and his old life and it's it's really just kind of a tune of becoming self-sufficient and going out there on your own and and taking that risk and becoming your own man really and even though I wish this album had a grander finish in in a way it did kind of feel like a fitting cliffhanger I feel like we kind of got a little bit of a picture of who Travis's and kind of how he's growing as an artist and and sort of what he's trying to do and Ti does a pretty decent job at various points of this record kind of enhancing that story and adding a bit of poetry here and there and adding a bit of drama and at the very end of this record kind of exposing to the audience exactly what the whole meaning and concept behind the idea of the rodeo is and before I move into the final moment of the review I do want to mention that flying high is another track on this record that I enjoy a lot to Tora moi is is featured on this track and what like a surprisingly creative and good and cohesive meld of Travis's and Tori Boz respective styles this is like a sun-drenched Beach ready banger and the way Chaz's vocals kind of soar over the the chorus on this thing of that sort of thing they sound fun they sound sweet they sound great and Travis just sounds so relaxed and laid-back and charismatic on this track and I love the bass and I love the twittering hi-hats on this thing it's it's a solid cut man and a nice kind of banger to help the last leg of this record and yeah I mean I'm just kind of floored I thought this record was really good I thought it was really really good I was surprisingly good I did not anticipate Travis Scott to come through with something that I really enjoyed as much as I enjoy as this thing I often have been returning to this record since I've had it I've been like doing really like this do I really like this make sure I like this and yeah I'm pretty sure I like it I think what Travis is doing with this AEL sound this southern sound right here on this record is very interesting and I think he's doing a lot of the southern artists these newer Southern artists I think is doing a lot of these trap artists a lot of these you know trap balladeers a service by putting this sound to a full-length album that is for the most part enjoyable from front to back a few lulls here and there a few weak tracks here and there but I think Travis put together a really solid project and did a great job of bringing on a lot of artists that are representative of this sound so that we have kind of like a communal celebration of this style of this musical trend right here and again set to instrumentals and and tunes that are a little more artful and a little more accessible and a little bit more intricate KITT KITT I didn't really like his past two projects at all and I feel like the difference between what he's done over the past few years and what he did here is like night and day and some of the some of the changes that he's made to his style and his sound have been very miniscule on some of these songs but they've made all the difference I'm feeling a eight on this thing transition did you think of this record it's bedtime it's bedtime goodnight

album review the new Janelle Monae arc Android before I get into the review I want to say for all you new and true-blue Ariel pink fans Ariel has a new project together called Ariel pink with added pizzazz there's a track from that project upcoming the EP on the website right now download it over there good times Janelle Monae is a singer songwriter dancer a real triple threat this is her debut full-length album and this thing has gotten some really heavy votes inside the mod box since I put that thing on the YouTube channel but I kind of just sat on the review and didn't do it as maybe soon as I should have and maybe that was because of fear and irrational fear kind of like how some people fear going to the dentist even though it's not that bad just the fear of trying something new I guess because Monet is Grammy nominated she is on P Diddy's record label and she's also been featured on American Idol just a lot of uncharted territory for my reviews not exactly the type of music I'm usually talking about but to be honest once I jumped into this LP it wasn't bad and here's how bad it wasn't despite all the mainstream hype in big-time musicians surrounding Monet as of late do not take this LP for your average pop album in fact most of the tracks don't even follow a normal pop structure but that's besides the point this thing is more conceptual intricate and colorful than most of the indie albums I've heard this year and totally spits in the face of the idea that as you get more popular you have to water down your art this thing is a big-time production has more credits on it than a feature-length film and it's definitely not an album for just putting on the high five and just leaving it alone and going about and washing your dishes and eating your food and petting your cat to fully appreciate this you have to sit down on the edge of your seat and just take in all of its twists and turns instrumentally and emotionally because this thing is all over the place in a good way because hip-hop jazz Motown funk contemporary R&B and orchestral pop all survive in harmony among these 18 tracks this album stylistic shifts just keep things feeling fresh and engaging and nothing really feels out of place except for the of Montreal collaboration on make the bus which is pretty much done in the band's usual over eccentric style it's really not that big of a pothole in the ride and ride is probably the best analogy I can come up with for this album especially in the first half which I kind of neglected up until this point to mention but this LP is actually split into two suites the second and third of a four-part series which is really not complete right now but the first part came out in an EP before this but anyway a ride yeah the first suite of this LP is incredibly fluid with just one song boozing into the next you really can't tell where one starts and one ends just one thing jumping into another overall the first half of this album does emphasize a more straightforward approach taking a lot of influence from guys like Michael Jackson Prince and James Brown just a lot of upbeat funky and brassy tracks and even the slower numbers on the first sweep for mayor just to immediate to deny the first half has its moments of experimentation but it's mostly catchy tunes the second part of this LP the third suite is actually where things get a little weird the longest tracks are in the third suite the songs are way more abstract and linear not repeating a lot of hooks a lot of string sections and there's even one moment where the strings section is playing the melody from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory pure imagination I'm surprised I haven't heard a lot of people talking about it but the thing is it's either the melody or it's so close to the melody that it's definitely inspiration or some kind of each and considering that that this LP would lift a melody from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from pure imagination specifically I feel like it just kind of embraces our key androids whole notion of fantasy it definitely works with the imaginative aesthetic that the lyrics tablet but of course our key Android isn't all sci-fi and futurism and androids there's some love songs in here to soften the blow but overall the third suite is a real mixed bag and save some of its weirdest parts for the end like on the 9 minute Bop pile which is full of jazz improvisation 's and double-oh-seven orchestrations it's possibly one of the most ambitious moments on this LP but may go sort of unnoticed just because it's so long it's kind of strung out and it's at the end of the album but to go back to what I said about ambition this thing has doodles of it and maybe it's to the point where it may turn off some listeners because if you like your pop simple sweet and straightforward this thing may not be the most easygoing album of 2010 but for a concept album it's really playful it's really fun and it's really thrilling my original gripe about this LP or really my first reaction to it is that I didn't like it or that I wasn't going to like it and the reason I felt that way was mostly because the sound the production the quality of this recording sounds very much like a modern or contemporary R&B recording like you may hear on commercial radio which is really not my thing however though this thing sounds very modern though it has a very new studio sound and it sounds like you know she recorded in a studio that she had access to because she's on P Diddy's record label it sounds like it was recorded kind of in that context but still the songwriting is fantastic this thing does not forget in fact it embraces the fundamentals of jazz and Motown it's everything I love about these older styles of music but put into a much more updated context and thrown together with very android-based subplot now there's tons of stuff in terms of concepts and ideas that I could talk about and even relate it to Fritz Lang's Metropolis and just ask all day what does this lyric mean what does this lyric mean for me that's more of a personal adventure that one has to make kind of interpreting all these things and I could be talking about how famous Janelle Monae is getting and about how a lot of people are just singing the overhyped blues but that is just a bunch of outside contextual stuff that doesn't really need to be discussed I'm here to vouch for the music and I can say beyond the shadow of the doubt in my opinion that the music on this album is good very very good in fact it's excellent in fact I'm giving it a strong eight if not a light nine it's a brave new album for a brave new world and I highly recommend it but let me know what you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana Janelle Monae arc Android Suites 2 & 3 forever [Music] you "},{"id":"x8VimAqOqZc","title":"The Strokes - Future Present Past EP","y":3,"x":"hi everyone Mega Man here Internet's busy history it's in there it's time for you a new stroke CP past present future present past this is a new EP from the famed pop rock and indie rock outfit known as The Strokes they are two albums deep into their comeback now and obviously an EP as well which is coming three years after what I think is probably the worst album in The Strokes discography however The Strokes returning to putting out music has not been all bad recently there was that Julian Casablancas and the voids album tyranny and this is a pretty polarizing album four-strokes fans a lot of people hated this record however me the needle drop in general we dug this record we dug it it was surprisingly experimental very textured adventurous some of the parts a little difficult to digest not for everybody an acquired taste but if you're looking for some noise rock that's kind of slick and catchy and is actually a little out there you know this isn't a safe record then give this thing a shot now again while this album is not for everyone this new EP over here I have no idea who this is for we have three new tracks here and a remix of one of the tracks on the EP and the batch of songs The Strokes offer here feels like an odd mix of some of the experimental elements that came from that Julian Casablancas and the voice record paired awkwardly with the the the same kind of slick swagger attitude that you expect from a Strokes project and I just can't say it sounds like a winning combination Julian Casablancas sticks out like a sore thumb on a lot of these tracks and not in a good way because he just sounds like he's off his rocker he sounds way more while old and out there in left field then the music is a lot of the time either that or he just sounds really disheveled or like he just doesn't know what he's doing which is typically the case when you catch the strokes live usually Julian Casablancas is visually inebriated in some kind of fashion and as a result it does make the live shows an interesting spectacle but usually the band sounds pretty sober and you know just really together on record and performance you know in the studio not really the case here as Julian's vocals and his vocal melodies on this cut feel really aimless and like he's just doing this weird the directionless moaning thing the chorus isn't bad I like all the menacing layers of guitars and since on this intro cut but the verses are awful the loose messy instrumentation does not sound good at all and much like many cuts off of comedown machine this this cut drag-queen has a really awkward New Wave element to it that just the strokes cannot they cannot grab ahold of what makes for a good New Wave track Julian's vocals also sound weirdly chipmunk down this track almost like they were pitched up a little bit can't can't quite tell because there's so many things about this cut including the vocals that just seemed off in some kind of way and the song oblivious isn't much better it's a little sweeter on the surface I think instrumentally it sounds like your run-of-the-mill Strokes track but when you actually get down with performance and the writing it's it's such a mess number one this thing has the worst guitar lead of 2016 worst lead guitar on the verse 2016 this little - note riff and then you sort of bring it up a few semitones or back down a few semitones gets so old so fast no compelling melodies on the verses here either again the chorus is ok but it doesn't make up for how lackluster almost every other thing about this song is and Julian's vocals on this track are even worse there are parts during the song where he is straining to reach into his upper register so hard that I can't tell whether he's singing or screaming for help because he's being strangled and this gets it's worse during the final passage of the song where Julian is essentially singing and I'm going to do my best impression here really a vocal performance that makes Yoko Ono sound tame now the song threat of joy the song doesn't just threaten to be decent it's it's actually somewhat decent and I wouldn't say it's the best track here because it does anything especially good in a lot of ways it feels like your run-of-the-mill stroke song maybe a little loose and rough around the edges kind of like a track that maybe during the band's first two albums period would have been a demo and they could have kind of cleaned it up and then performed it on one of those first two records and it would have become one of the less memorable songs in the track listing but I guess it doesn't do any of the stuff that makes two previous songs horrendous that kind of makes it a plus and then we have this completely unnecessary remix of the worst song on the EP and that's just the EP guys I'm not really sure what to make of this batch of tracks is this where the strokes are going next now in theory I don't think it's a bad thing with The Strokes are experimenting they're long overdue for a sound change I think you know they've been at it for a while now and they have been evolving in a way with each new album however this could be the worst moment of their evolution so far if this EP and the sounds and the the vibe of this EP were to develop into a full-length album and that worries me I'm going to be leaving this EP with a strong to to a light three

it's time for review of the new converge album the dusk in us Salem Massachusetts metalcore legends converge are back with their ninth album and what can be said about converge at this point like they've written so many metalcore classics like Jesus Christ one killer record after another Jane Doe and you fail me axe to fall and no heroes and even their 90 stuff while not as fully formed as the material that they dropped last decade still had a wild and a frantic personality and character to it that still maintains to this day in their newer material over the years they've written some of the most abrasive throttling and progressive metalcore ever and they just can't stop they just keep it going now the band's last full-length record five years ago in 2012 all we love we leave behind seemed to me almost like an exercise in dynamics and melody for the band easily their most varied album so far in terms of style in motion and intensity the band was staying pretty true to their metalcore roots while working in some very obvious nods to sludge metal and post hardcore and it's fantastic even now to see the band continuing to challenge themselves and release quality albums now converge haven't dropped a major disappointment of a record yet in my opinion so as a result with this new album my expectations going into it were high and given the ever-changing landscape of loud rock with how eager converge seemed to be to step outside of their comfort zone on their last album I expected this new record over here to deliver some risks as well but simultaneously tracks like I can tell you about pain for me kind of felt like these short formulaic teasers where it was kind of converged by the numbers these singles to me did not feel as groundbreaking or as exciting as tracks like aimless arrow did five years ago and listening to this entire record now it does seem like converge is kind of going back a little bit to a more raw abrasive Mathi sound relying more on crazy grooves and difficult time signatures to keep the audience on the edge of their seat the production is a bit more brittle and thin and noisy this time around the drums are not nearly as Bumi as they were on converges last album the guitars not quite as dense and as heavy which for longtime fans might not necessarily be a bad thing because aesthetically it does seem like this record has quite a bit in common with records like no heroes or even Jane Doe but compositionally the dusk in US isn't quite as frenzied the band is still trying to write a pretty dynamic album here the song a single tear that opens the album up kicks the entire record off with these frenzied drums these angular anthemic guitar leads this intense metalcore instrumentation eventually crumbles to this heart-wrenching vocal break it builds from there in a really cohesive way into this amazing ascending set of drums and guitar riffs and leads then you have this refrain about a single teardrop falling and these noodley epic guitars that like it's amazing that converge on this track is really writing one of their most finely crafted and detailed songs like the band brings this incredible visceral energy on this track and many other tracks but when you actually get into the Nitty Gritty of this song and many others on here like they are so detailed they're so intricate they're so methodically assembled but it doesn't necessarily seem like that on the surface it's almost like the band is just so wild and angry and aggressive that they're just like you know pulling all of this out of the ether following tracks like under duress have these amazing empowering gang vocals this cycling hypnotic head-banging riff arkhipov calm if I'm pronouncing that correctly has these amazing syncopated rapid-fire drums and guitars that play throughout the track that are really like their critics I and Jakob bannon's impassioned shouts throughout the cut are incredible to his monstrous screams just sliced through the insanity of the instrumentation as usual and the cruel cruel world bit on the song wildlife is easily one of the catchiest choruses on the entire record and I can tell you about pain honestly within the context of the album has really grown on me and digging deeper into the lyrics of the album it almost seems like the song is about trying to survive and get away from some kind of abusive relationship not necessarily a romantic one it could be read maybe that way but it seemed like the the relationship could have been applied to a lot of different scenarios the point that I'm trying to make is on these four tracks I just mentioned and on other songs here the band is writing this vein popping metalcore music that still has some really catchy details woven into it or just some really interesting lyrical or musical ideas that really kind of stick with me very little of this album goes by in a blur as much meat-and-potatoes metalcore does but converge despite their rage despite the the frenzy of their music it really kind of comes down to detail detail detail case in point the song broken by light which i think is a testament to just how much musically the band can pack into one minute and 40 seconds there are only a few tracks here that while they were angry and loud and aggressive didn't leave much of a compositional impression on me and that would probably be cannibals and I of the quarrel the one track that really did start to test my patience though had to have been the seven minute title song on this thing which features these lifeless lead vocals and a kind of drab guitar passage at the very start that don't do too much for me but I do like the way you have these ghostly tones kind of swelling at a few different points in the song behind the vocals behind the rhythm guitars it's got a bit of a post-rock atmosphere to it and a pretty heavy powerful ending and I get the record needed a centerpiece and I get that the band is trying to be more versatile I understand and accept that however there has to be some kind of functional middle ground between extreme anger extreme volume and extreme emptiness extreme which I think the song thousands of miles between us comes closer to achieving this track is one of the more loke cuts in the tracklisting here and it has it's underwhelming moments too but the vocals do reach a more passionate high toward the end and by vocals I mean the cleanly sung vocals not the screams it almost turns into like this sad dejected alt-rock song with like metal guitars almost kind of reminding me of Code Orange a little bit but you know it has its own vibe and there are a few other experiments in the tracklisting here that I think panned out really well like on the song Merc and Mara which features like these tents spazzy shots of guitar over these like really primal bass lines and drum beats it has a really odd structure for a song like a really odd just tension based foundation but it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and then you have the very groovy and sinister trigger which has just this head bobbing devilish funk to it that is kind of odd and totally unexpected for converge and they totally pull it off with their usual level of aggression and with their tight flawless performance style the ending of this album is somewhat solid the final tracks segue into one another pretty nicely however I wouldn't say reptilian is one of the best finishers of any converge record I feel like it is one of these sludgy er heavier more harmonious tracks on the album's so it almost kind of became the de facto closer on this thing as a result it's okay it's a little anticlimactic though I will give the song kudos for having some of the best lyrics on the entire record I love the themes on this track of just endless war and control and a higher evil power sort of just playing things down below like it's a chess game but still I can't help but feel like this song could have landed at least at a few different spots in the tracklisting and the album really kind of could have run the same all that being said though I think this is another incredibly solid and super enjoyable converge album like the band just keeps putting numbers on the board and the band keeps writing some of the best music that this genre has to offer they're still one of the most unique bands in loud rock in in rock in general and I feel like the lyrical theme on this album of violence and a lack of compassion in mankind in general hit even harder than they usually do given the social climate we're in the midst of I love this thing everything that's great about it is pretty clear pretty on the surface so it shouldn't be too difficult for anybody who is typically into this style of music or have appreciated converges work in the past to enjoy what the band is doing here I think the record doesn't really come off with as strong and artistic character as all we love or Jane Doe or you fail me but even though converge kind of played things as to be expected they still play to their strengths this Scylla very well produced album it still have incredibly performed album and some of their best material today lands on this thing I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it

"},{"id":"twoje8x5-R4","title":"Coldplay - A Head Full of Dreams ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone if any Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Coldplay record head full of dreams famed English rock and pop band Coldplay they really need no introduction at this point you should be well aware of them by now they are on their seventh album here they are following up the very skeletal and very moody ghost stories which dropped a few years ago wasn't a huge fan of the record sounded kind of lullaby ish and not in the best of ways but a negative opinion getting thrown the way of a Coldplay album isn't really that unusual because the band's output for the past 10 years has been a little controversial little polarizing from the very synthetic and grand X&Y to the incredibly dense and commercial and glitzy Mylo Xyloto Coldplay hasn't really given us something that fans and critics can uniformly celebrate for a long time but because of the band's high talent level because of their high profile there's always reason to have hope I hope now with this new record over here on the surface head full of dreams it's a more maximal a more dense record it's a more visceral record it's more colourful it's more melodic it's definitely livelier especially since a lot of the tracks here are backed with some pretty nice organic dance grooves or even sequenced beats like in the case of him for the weekend which is Coldplay's attempt at a party song even the very somber piano ballad ever glow has the sequence Basie kick drum going on in the background a very easygoing tempo you also have the very groovy bass line and the layered poly rhythmic percussions section of adventure of a lifetime which seems kind of talking heads or LCD soundsystem inspired percussion is really a focal point of this album and a lot of the time it's employed in a pretty classy way Coldplay could have easily just backed all these songs with a bunch of EDM banger style drops and all that stuff but they didn't do that in instead they delivered some very well-balanced percussion that fit nicely with the shimmering pretty instrumentation and Chris Martin's very boyish vocals there's even like some 808 inspired snares and hi-hats on the song army of one at one point I like the percussion on this record I like a lot of the instrumentals on this record if only the songwriting had as much bite to it though on almost every one of their albums there's at least one song where Coldplay is trying to pull off their best u2 impression and that sort of happens on the intro track they kind of just get it out of the way so the song there isn't really that sticky or memorable also the track adventure of a lifetime after the great groove on the song gets established it's like Chris Martin's vocals just start really inconsequential and don't add that much to the tune the dance beat is there and that really seems to be all the band was focused on I feel the same way about the songbirds except for the chorus there it's actually really beautiful chorus on this track even if the verses are kind of underwhelming on him for the weekend the lyrics here seem oddly hedonistic for Coldplay a little awkward a little out of place and I think the song is too focused on being grand and being layered to actually be this hard-hitting party track that I think they were shooting for but Beyonce actually does some vocal contributions here which go over pretty nicely I have no idea what the band was thinking on the song kaleidoscope it's like this really weird deep-voiced piano interlude that's a little monologue ish sounds like something you might catch on an old Tom Waits record or something like that while the second half of army of one I do enjoy the first half of this track but then there's a bit of a instrumental shift and the final passage of the song kind of sounds like I'm listening to a remixed version of Kendrick Lamar's swimming pools almost every track here I'm not fully onboard with for one reason or another and even the songs on here that I think are some of the better ones here like the song fun which i think is one of the better written tunes here great melodies the song up and up the closer here is incredibly blissful and the song amazing day which is one of the slower tracks here really tuneful really wonderful and pretty I think one of the prettier songs here and actually works on this really great 3/4 time signature it sounds like it could be a go-to for 2016's prom season again I think the aim was bliss but it's kind of a toothless bliss it's not very potent and as far as the music on this record being more lively being more fun I don't really get the idea from this record that Coldplay knows how to have fun it's trying to give this impression of fun and wildness and letting go when in fact it's just too clean and reserved and too perfectly planned out to be that Coldplay wanted to dance here but I think it just kind of ended up drab instead I'm peeling a light a decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you did what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Coldplay forever "},{"id":"jbxpNHEWfao","title":"Big Sean - I Decided ALBUM REVIEW","y":6,"x":"hi everyone knows me wait a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review review a real review of the new Big Sean album I decide Big Sean Detroit rapper he's back again with another album his fourth full-length commercial project an album that again I am taking seriously especially since my last review of Big Sean's music was a glorious cop-out for the album dark sky paradise where essentially for about four minutes or so I just said the word no and for 24 amazing hours if you googled Big Sean my review was the first thing that would pop up now why why did I do this my reasoning behind putting out this anti review is that in my opinion a big sean is hip-hop's most non-essential character right now up until the point of this new album Big Sean has had a couple mixtapes a bunch of singles three big commercial projects and since releasing that music not a single sound rap style that he hasn't borrowed from somewhere else or at least saw a contemporary do better and not a single hit that we're going to remember ten years from now except maybe to recall some of the low points of hip hop in this decade but I do have to say that Big Sean kinda came through on this new album over here and that's not to say he's turned a new leaf on this album a lot of the time on this thing he still sounds like a poor man's Drake but at least I guess he's making good Drake tracks as on this album Big Sean is mostly making use of the very moody nocturnal trap vibes that you caught on Drake's if you're reading this it's too late mixtape a sound that Drake almost immediately abandoned to put together this total mixed bag of a project with no themes running through it whatsoever save for a handful of whitewashed dancehall songs so if Sean wants to focus on a sound and a style that one of his biggest influences abandoned then sure why not and that's pretty much what he does here I mean it's not hard to imagine Drake recording any number of the songs on this album and actually coming through with better results especially in the case of the tracks where Sean is mostly relying on his very flimsy singing voice to carry the tract Shawn even writes the same kind of woe is me I'm dissecting my fame and how it impacts my personal life bars on the song Sunday morning jet pack and the same clever cute observations without the relationship that never was bars on the track jump out the window now these songs aren't terrible I definitely give Sean credit for how earnestly and smartly he pulls apart this relationship that is failing but he's desperate to repair it on the track Oh me but we heard this before now despite Sean's severe lack of originality for another album there are some things on this record I legitimately enjoy I love the song bounce back stellar single I love the catchy cold-blooded hook on this thing the nocturnal laid-back beak from Metro boomin there are some nice flow changes on this thing some standout bars like my daddy was a G it's genetics there's one line about people like changing more than wishing wells or more change than wishing wells that was pretty cloning the song though favors is OK but the inclusion of Eminem on the track is really odd I get that Big Sean probably wanted to tribute this guy who essentially put Detroit on the map in a lot of ways but they're pairing is really odd their Styles don't exactly mesh together and I really questioned whether or not mmm added all that much to the the theme of the track even though I do find his verse to be very funny very self-aware very nasty as usual but it kind of sounds like he phoned it in from the inside of a meat locker somewhere as there's like really weird bouncy echo on his voice but this moment on the album doesn't feel nearly out of place as a stick to the plan stick to the plan one of the weirdest transitions I've heard on a rap record this year is Sean kind of put together this voices in my head stick to the plan half two-part multifaceted track it just seems really sloppy kind of weakly put together and with big face like Zordon there's a fucking Power Rangers reference the song moves is OK I like it for a lot of the same reasons I like bounce back though it's not nearly as infectious and the song sacrifices with me ghost goes over way better than I generally had anticipated it is a grind anthem about all the things that you might need to sort of cut back on in order to make to your goal achieve your dreams Shaun's verse has one of the most fast and intense flows on the entire album his most fiery performance on the entire record migos their contribution is OnPoint the vocal harmonies that they pull together are pretty cool and I also like the beats hypnotic piano loops and that one bar about focusing on the inner me and never my enemy and the closer bigger than me is actually a very luscious finish to the album with the inclusion of the Flint chosen choir their vocals make the track really gorgeous and the track highlights what I think Big Sean does best on this record and that is deliver some very personal and impassioned lyrics he seems admirably humble at times on this project though I mean I would be too if I somehow it made a career out of being behind the curve I think I can agree with what a lot of people are saying about this record that this is Big Sean's best album so far but Big Sean's best album is a decent Drake album opened up with the track that features the kind of intentionally corny but very smart wordplay that you would catch on like Kanye's the college dropout so I mean while I did enjoy a lot of this record there's only so much that I could praise it because yet again Big Sean continues to be the most non-essential artist in hip-hop today because he doesn't really bring anything to the table that his contemporaries aren't already with every project he puts out it's just like he's bringing seconds for people who haven't had quite enough of what's already out there I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition and have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which would I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry cool cool Anthony Fantana Big Sean other videos

fall white why is it hot and humid again stop so this is right now stop being hot here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new national album sleep well beast the National is an Indian art rock band nearing almost two decades of music so good for them on that however that doesn't really change the fact that going into this album I wasn't really all that excited it's no secret that the band's last record Trouble will find me kind of rubbed me the wrong way which to me is personally disappointing not only because I think a lot of their older work is quite good but also there are a lot of characteristics to the national sound that I feel naturally I should just like and take to their sleek style their mature songwriting frontman Matt Berninger very deep crooning vocal style also the band's very subtle post-punk influences sometimes the band's music can feel a little gray and lifeless lacking in anything in terms of a pulse or excitement but this new album over here brings a nice change of pace it's a pleasant surprise muah-muah not saying the national have all of a sudden become this loud bold off-the-wall band oh man they're pulling out all the stops this this album's fireworks no that's not the case on this new record however the National don't seem quite as listless on this album the instrumentation sounds a lot fuller more detailed more vibrant it's not really skeletal or super empty like the last record or kind of washed out and a tad too much reverb as it was in my opinion on hi violet sleep well beast is a very tangible album both musically and lyrically I don't just feel like I'm listening to some kind of soundtrack of musical pastiche for a white guy sulking in his high-rise apartment that he rented in a freshly gentrified neighborhood as he is getting dressed and ready to go out and get drunk at his favorite overpriced wine bar not to say that that isn't an accurate description of this album to a degree but sleep well beast isn't just that Matt's vocals on this thing are a lot closer a lot more intimate which i think makes the sorrowful demeanor of his singing that much more potent the tracklist on this thing is a really broken up into moody dirges and propulsive rockers this thing is calm its meditative its downhearted but beautiful as well and kind of numbing the very still sad and lonely ballad no one else will be there starts the album off pretty nicely the song is very subtle almost has an ambient vibe it kind of lulls me into a trance that the following track day I die smashes into pieces with its screaming guitar leads and driving Tom rhythms not to mention that melodically I think this is one of the most anthemic tracks the National has dropped since like boxer following this we have the hypnotizing walk it back which that's a very cerebral pace it kind of locks me into place as I slowly soak in the utterly defeated vibe of Matt singing and lyrics and there are more electrifying highlights to come down the tracklisting like the system only dreams in total darkness and turtleneck both of which hit some very passionate highs I mean especially turtleneck like the drums and guitars on that track are almost thunderous and for whatever reason as Matt picks up the intensity in his vocals and the band really starts roaring their music almost becomes like like a bit of a dead ringer for some late air and Nick cave but without going full rip off like it's kind of tasteful and very flattering and I think exposes a very essential and very nice major influence for the band it's also cool to hear the band incorporating more electronics into their repertoire as well on this album and to hear those electronics get infused into their typical style so well it brings so much extra color a new kind of snappiness to their style and the tambour and tone of the percussion and the synthesizers kind of have that same cool slick laid back but moody vibe that their drums and guitars and vocals typically do highlights like I'll still destroy you and guilty party the latter of which features this haunting lullaby style melody coming from Matt's vocals that despite its subtlety to me was one of the stickiest moments on the entire record that and just the heart-wrenching tale told in the lyrics however I wouldn't say this record is just all glory from front to back while it is just a tad longer than the band's previous material it's it's a little long-winded especially when considering just how slow and dreary the national sound typically is and there are some songs where I feel like the instrumental build or the songwriting itself is just kind of off like the quietly puttering electronics and sad-sack piano chords on born to beg that I think leave a lot to be desired especially considering that Matt singing atop this instrumentation just kind of mutters his way sadly through the entire song this is probably a moment when any other frontman would really sell the track but that's just really that's not Matt then we have Empire line which in my opinion is almost as underwhelming and redundant if not for the slight instrumental crescendo toward the very end of the track that isn't even really that gratifying and the last several tracks of the album does not leave the record with a strong finish in fact it is pretty much the most forgettable material on the entire project from Karen at the liquor store which almost ends out of nowhere to the title track which isn't really interesting enough to justify its six minute runtime as it's mostly packed with quirky instrumental filler orbiting around the groove the band set earlier in the song but for national fans this is probably exactly what you're expecting or even wanting from the band at this point in their career I don't know take my critiques of the National with a grain of salt because at this point in their career a lot more people seem to be crazier about them than me but still even I can see that the band has grown and improved vastly over their last couple of albums even if those were very well received to the band's performances and songwriting seem a little bit more engaging the production is clearer and more vibrant more punchy more balanced as well each piece of instrumentation has a very distinct flavor and place in the mix and this is the first time in a long time when the band's music has truly been emotionally stirring and relatable even if their shtick is still kind of glazed over in a first world problem malaise I'm feeling a light decent 7 on this album Treach or treacherous for a transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next I feel like

REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd doing a quick and a raw review here of the new young thug and carnage EP young Martha young thug Atlanta a rapper crooner eccentric carnage DJ producer no no more introduction needed at this point I'm guessing he dropped an incredible single earlier this year titled homie featuring Meek Mill which was attached to an amazing music video by the way but this song is one of the year's most insane and off the wall bangers I have heard like the bass is crazy and young thug on this beat is delivering this crazy Cookie Monster performance and at first I thought it was somebody else but like what I actually figured out that it was him going this insane on the cut I was like holy crap like this is this is a little much and I actually enjoyed hearing him go that crazy go that animated on a cut like it definitely felt like he was really trying to push the envelope there like young thug his vocalizations and his vocal performances they're pretty crazy they're pretty insane sometimes he does play it a little too safe in my opinion and just sort of gives a stereotypical performance for for himself but every once in a while man and and this track is an example he just totally reaches a new level and just you know just just when you think you've heard young thug do vocally everything he's ever gonna do he just just like Wow's me and he does that almost consistently on every single song here like if you want to consistently hear young thug be left field and be weird and just be as eccentric as you know he has the potential to be you have to hear this EP because not only is homie a great kicker and an amazing track but the following cuts are equally as impressive liger has a great groove - it almost has like this bass and synth pad urn to it that sort of reminds me of like I don't know like a lot of migos production but maybe Metro boomin or something but there's kind of a very sweet like woodwind melody in there that I like quite a bit young thug is a little Yelp e'er and a little more out there than usual on this track it's very hooky it's very sweet it's got a you know a nice sort of vibe e energy to it and then following that 10,000 slimes it's the most low-key track and the track listing here but there's a seriously like moody and mournful tone to the song especially coming out of thugger 'zv ocol performance here that I like a lot like it's is very much a sad moment on the EP it really kind of gets me down I I do enjoy sort of the sudden emotional shift there and just how well the track is performed and then don't call me The Closer on this thing buggers yell penis and nasal miss is just astronomical on this thing to the point where he's just like reaching into registers where he's straining so hard and like I can barely even explain it and describe it because it's it's just it's such a like profoundly weird moment for him vocally I love this thing I think it's really good I just wish there was more to say about it I wish there was more material on here like considering how exciting and saw the material is here like I would love to hear more from these two in the future I hope this isn't all that we ever hear from young Martha as where I hope that this EP just ends up being a taster because not only do I think that carnage and Fugger bring out the best in each other on this thing but I do think this is legitimately one of the better EPS of the year what do you think of this thing if you've given it a listen do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next and over here next to my head is another young thug review that you can check out or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel you're the best I'll

review of the new beach house album 7-7 is the seventh full-length album from the Baltimore dream pop duo beach house over here consisting of Victoria Legrand and Alex Cali a band who I was a pretty big fan of in the late 2000s because I mean hey they were dropping some of the best in the genre but as significant a moment beach house was for Dream pop and for indie according to me around that time frame I was almost on the cusp of completely tuning out of the duo's music after their last couple of releases it just started to sound like the duo was running out of ideas not only on their album bloom which sure it's one of the more solid and consistent records but it just kind of sounded like a hi-5 version of the trademark sound the duo forged on their first two records with the distant drum machines and romantic guitars and Victoria Legrand's just really slow beckoning vocals all the dreamy organs all the reverb I mean again it was good it was a decent record but kind of a letdown after the incredibly versatile experimental and exciting teen dream just a few years earlier now the following depression cherry felt like even more of a dip in quality it was not only devoid of any new sounds or ideas but somehow Victoria and Alex came out of the tail end of this record with not much in the way of compelling songs either and thank your lucky stars which came out the same year felt even more unnecessary the recordings on this project were even more off it just kind of felt like the duo was just making a record out of the cutting room floor I mean maybe calling this record the cutting room floor is sort of unfair but I'm just not sure how else to explain the severe an obvious drop in recording quality and songwriting quality I mean even the b-sides and rarities collection the beach house dropped last year which are actual legitimate leftovers sounded much better than this album so while in one breath it felt like it was going to be difficult to maintain any kind of excitement for any Beach House album going forward 7 was legit looking like it was going to be something kind of different because every single that teased toward the release this album actually sounded kind of experimental for the duo and it's no wonder after finding out that beach house actually brought on spaceman three's peak camber to do production on this thing Pete who is also a multi-instrumentalist and has released a whole catalog of music under names such as experimental audio research and sonic boom and has dabbled in the likes of drone and alternative rock and space rock even electronic music so as a sound sculptor Pete's reputation is fringe and his resume is long which in my opinion is exactly the thing that beach house needs at this point in their career a new sound of fresh sound a new direction please for the love of God and thankfully a new sound is what they have on this project not only is the production and instrumentation on this new Beach House album refreshing but it's also dreamy haunting thick textured colorful and luscious it feels like Beach House has matured from making simple dream pop into kind of fusing pop together with shoegaze this album is nearly as versatile as Teen Dream it's easily their most adventurous set of tracks since that album and maybe their most stimulating album since that album and not just because of the sound of this record but the songs are sounding kind of revitalized to the song dark spring is a killer intro to this album with lots of patient percussion droning keyboards a wall of guitars that has a really light rough distortion on it these eerie breathy vocals as well sounds like Alex and Victoria singing together it kind of reminds me of like a black moth super rainbow song but without the faux psychedelia and kind of gimmicky bells and whistles there's also a subtle schmaltz on the instrumentation and the melody on this track too it sort of reminds me of elevator music but maybe if the elevator were going up to heaven the song pay no mind flows really well out of the intro track it's a nice cool down after the noisy storm of serenity on the intro with lots of slow-motion rhythm guitars it kind of sounds like an unwound piece of alt rock it's got a lot of space it's got a lot of ambience but still the guitars and the instrumentation are very very heavy they're still super tangible not too much reverb not too washed out the incredibly resonant guitar chords match incredibly well with the super breathy lead vocals kind of whisper quiet the track is as euphoric it is orgasmic I also love the slinky synth leads that kind of bounce back and forth paired with the persistent high hats on song lemon glow as the song plods along it also features these apocalyptically distorted and sunburnt and fuzz out wailing lead guitars kind of playing back and forth in both channels it's pretty trippy and it's one of the tracks on the record that features a somewhat intense finish with these guitars some marching snares kind of reaching a fever pitch the song Lincoln you is one of the more vast and open tracks on the album the vocals maybe a little buried on the track which does take away from it a bit I do think the sound for beach house is just a little typical or predictable but still with some extra effects and instrumental layers it sounds like beach houses usual stick but sounding Cathedral sized it's a bigger more massive beach house like not not like a two-floor beach house but maybe a six floor 6,000 square foot beach house this is one of a few moments on this album where I feel like beach house is kind of resting on their laurels a little bit but they get away with it by adding a few extras or progressing things just a little bit however that's not the only point on the record where the duo seems to be playing it safe for example the song girl of the year features much less in the way of surprises or really anything interesting however on the song drunk in LA the dramatic songwriting of beach house classics like heart of chambers returns especially with the super rocket of imagery coming out of Legrand's lyrics on here talking about horses running through her mind wanting strangers to be hers climbing the Eiffel Tower also some really nice instrumental layers on this track too as it progresses with Alex Cali pulling off these nice sweet harmonized guitar solos now the song dive is kind of like the ten-mile stereo of the album both songs have a fantastic momentum but this one doesn't kind of show it's it's full hand until later in the track after the midpoint dive sounds like a mere interlude at first with super washed out keys and vocals Victoria seems to overdub her voice so she has kind of this call-and-response effect with her two voices the track seems to get more and more blissful heavier and heavier more and more intense until the instrumentation starts to melt away revealing this super heavy incredibly aggressive sequence drum pattern then these grinding guitars with a nice kind of rough distortion on them with this kind of driving route no riff it really holds down a steady groove on the track and I don't know it it seems like a really interesting mix of My Bloody Valentine like a little new order being thrown in there slow dramatic synth pop seems to be a prime influence on the song whoo as well even if maybe songwriting wise it's not one of the best tunes on the record black car to me felt much more compelling even if it's not as peppy a tune the songs intro features these plucky chilly synth leads that sound like they could kick off like a track on Bjork's Vespertine after this the song slowly blossoms into one of the coldest and most dreary on the entire tracklist although I think it could have used a stronger outro and maybe more direction after the initial instrumental build because eventually the song just sort of begins to coast out without Victoria or Alex adding much more to it the song lose your smile tries to translate beach houses typical sound to like some slow warm sunshine psyche rock guitars and stylistically it mostly works the problem is is that this song is really one of the most lifeless on the entire record really the pacing and the way that the verse kind of flaccid ly transitions into the chorus it's really one of this album's true moments of stagnation the song last ride though which is the album's outro is one of the most epic of the bunch it stands six minutes and creatively brings us together these 60s girl group dramatic snare tambourine drum patterns together with the large sprawling soundscapes of like a great experimental ambient drone it takes a while to kind of build momentum up but it's a great meld of styles that really only a duo like Beach House could pull off overall I think seven is a pretty good dream pop album and definitely a bounce-back for Beach House in terms of quality and adventure I do kind of wish they went a little more all-out though because it does feel like they came up just short of pulling out all the stops there are a few tracks where the songwriting sounds a little half-baked or Alex and Victoria are painting themselves into a corner once again with their usual sound still though I'm happy to hear the duo come back with one of their better records in a while and I just hope they keep up this sense of adventure on future albums I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this project transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like feel like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another beach house review you can check out hit that up and yeah that's it beach house Anthony Fantana forever "},{"id":"mlLqB2lxii4","title":"Tyler, the Creator - Flower Boy ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hahaha good the hi everyone don't say anything to hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tyler the Creator albums flower boy yellow flannel is on view is going cameras on microphone is on over here cue Cal Church esta making out with a picture of Tyler the Creator and I think we are ready to start the review this is the latest full-length album from California rapper Tyler the Creator once the flagship member of the slightly defunct Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all a West Coast rap collective whose member to member relations seemed more tentative than ever I mean that they're still kind of the kind of thing but in my opinion Odd Future kind of waning a little bit as a group is not necessarily a bad thing because there's always been a massive talent gap between the group's best and worst members and with that separation I've been hoping that the group's best members kind of find more clarity in their work especially Tyler over here who I have been kind of disappointed in his past efforts because I feel like he is one of the members of the collective who has had the most potential which I hope would be capitalized on with each new release and yet however in the lead-up to this new album over here fell like flower boy for me at least was going to be that artistically defining moment for Tyler not because of the revelations about his sexuality peppered throughout some of the lyrics on this album which the music media and sensationalist hip hop fans made a bigger deal of than Tyler's actual core fanbase but some of the lead singles on this thing like who dat boy and nine-one-one slash mr. lonely in my opinion where some of Tyler's best material to date it finally felt like Tyler was brushing up on his rapping and his production skills his flows were smoother his performance seemed more animated than he mature the production was well mixed well balanced Eddi hard-hitting bassy and exciting and visceral on who that some of the finer and smoother and jazzier moments on some of the lead singles of this thing were very beautiful the awkwardness and the clunkiness that ruins some of tyler slow jams in the past especially on Cherry Bomb seems to have kind of dissipated so going into this record I was looking forward and hoping to hear a Tyler album that wasn't plagued by some of the same technical flaws that made some of his past work just difficult listen but one more thing that had me excited on the lead up to this record is that everything has been relatively silent on the social media and the headline front meaning it's been a while since Tyler's been embroiled in a lot of the same Internet drama that seemed to be kind of informing a lot of the lyrical content on his past work much of which I just found really uninteresting and petty and boring now I feel like I'm finally able to hear a record where Tyler is just completely out of the woods on this endless feedback cycle between him and the music media and now that he's out of that bubble I'm just kind of curious to see if he has anything interesting to say is there really anything to him just beyond being confrontational with his online detractors and Tyler actually does have a lot of interesting things to say on this record right from the start of it on the track forward Tyler hits listeners with a nice string of thoughtful rhymes coated with some strong wordplay and it's almost like he's questioning just how much longer he has in the limelight or if he'll continue exceeding expectations as he has in the past this is kind of an introspective side of Tyler that I found very interesting on bastard when I heard it but I only got little bits of it in the future once Odd Future blew up and one more thing I found pretty striking on this track as well as other cuts on here are all these references to materialism cars chains things that Tyler really seems to be infatuated with on this new record but in the past was something that he didn't really care about or would actively talk about caring about which almost kind of leads me to believe that he's using things like cars to fill a void that's very clearly informing the moodiness of a lot of songs on this project like pothole and boredom and garden shed there are a lot of songs on this that had this dreamy yet dreary aesthetic like many cuts that were on Cherry Bomb they're smooth they're lavishly layered they're jazzy they're soulful however this time I feel like we're dealing with instrumentals and songs that are much more solidly composed and gorgeously arranged too and just the sound of this thing man I've never been so impressed with just the sound of the instrumentation on a tiler project which in the past especially on goblin has come off kind of shoddy by comparison flower boy is expansive it's kaleidoscopic it's so intricate it just sounds like Tyler's finally coming into his own as a producer while still showcasing a lot of the things that made his music special in the first place this deep appreciation of jazz and a very healthy dose of Pharrell worship which turns up on a lot of the percussion patterns and the beats or in some of the Corky synthesizer leads that squawk their way through some of these very smooth instrumentals if I had to pick on one instrumental on this record though it would be where this flower blooms featuring Frank Ocean it's one of the few beats on this thing I found to be kind of hollow a little lifeless and flat Tyler doesn't have the most passionate delivery on the track and Frank Ocean I think leaves a little bit to be desired the kind of lazy demeanor to his performance I think works a little bit better when he appears on the song nine-one-one generally though I think the features on this thing do add a lot to the record Tyler really did string together some pretty capable singers to carry some of the jazzy or interludes on this thing even Jaden Smith on this thing who I was not anticipating liking at all I feel like his boyish a voice and very stone cold demeanor played very nicely against Tyler's a very cartoony rasp and little Wayne's feature on drop-in seeds actually played very nicely into the floral themes that are kind of peppered throughout the record so not only are there a lot of good guests on this thing but there's so many sticky melodies and hooks 20 times on a 20 vision cool a boy via me is Who am I gonna check out is there gotta check out her chest find some time find some time to do something I'm just surprised how many moments on this record cemented themselves in my head even after just a few listens of the album it just felt really easy to become very some Miller with the album very quickly and yet it still feels like I'm peeling back little musical details and intricacies each time I listen now as far as the lyrical content goes on this thing I feel like we're finally getting an opportunity to unravel Tyler as a personality and kind of a weird musical celebrity a weird popular culture enigma kind of like this album is just a fainting couch for him to lay on as he tells us everything that's been driving him crazy over the past few years and we're just a silent therapist listening and nodding but I think a lot of what Tyler says on this thing kind of boils down to the dichotomy of the title of the album itself scum flower boy just think of those two phrases kind of playing off of each other what each one signifies though I do think that this album is more flower boy than it is scum  there are a few grimy bangers on this thing like I ain't got time and who died boy but even on these tracks you'll find lines where Tyler is talking about his sexuality as queerness making reference to more of that flower boy side of the title and after listening to this entire album I I don't so much feel like we're talking about two sides of Tyler that are at war or odds with one another rather I came away from this record feeling like these two sides are a little more like yin and yang they're kind of deeply ingrained and informed by one another and very inseparable and it's not like the tracks on the track listing that are more sonically smooth and soulful and sugary don't have any bite to them either we have lots of lyrics on the softer cuts here where Tyler makes reference to his kind of lone wolf status his tendency to push people away his loneliness how he's just kind of unapologetic about his somewhat antisocial behavior yeah this album also shows Tyler at his softest I think the softest we've ever seen him in his entire discography putting out some actually like very capable love songs on this thing other tracks on here more about his insecurities his struggle to beat himself his sexuality his vulnerability which I think if there's one word that you could boil a lot of this album down to it's that this is a legitimately emotional and personal album from Tyler the Creator Tyler the freaking Creator like if you told me when goblin came out we'd eventually be here I might have laughed in your face but somehow the album ends up being pretty gratifying and relatable to and actually works beyond the Tyler the Creator and Odd Future cult of personality a few tracks in the tracklisting pale in comparison to others and I think that I would have been more interested to see Tyler organize some of these thoughts into more bite-sized and cohesive and focused tracks taking on specific topics with each song occasionally he does do that but not throughout but most of the time I just kind of feel like I'm listening to Tyler just spill out the contents of a toy box or something which is not necessarily a bad thing because it's very fun and very easy to sort of sift through all of what he's saying my last major critique of the album is really that it does not end on the strongest of notes I don't really feel like the song glitter is all that much of a final statement or a thematic wrap-up to everything that Tyler has sort of dumped on us with this record it's lovey dovey it's pretty it's kind of well put together and it expands the space of Tyler softer side on this record but it's essentially the last song of the album with the actual last track of the record just being this extended instrumental which I kind of like it's a decent instrumental Tyler is clearly trying to tell us something with the title of this instrumental too but really what does it say as far as a summation of everything this album has been about thus far not really much still though despite those shortcomings I think this album is Tyler's best effort to date it's very tight 47 minutes it's his best produced album his best written and conceived album his best performed and wrapped album and I loved a great deal of the tracks on this thing I'm feeling a decent a strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

would be share that 90's that beautiful 90s gold for the next month thank you thanks for watching and that's the promo on with the review uh it's all been building up to this to this moment uh hi everyone Nothe nice leap tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd tired of an up all night man up all night with frank ocean this has been four years in the making frank ocean singer-songwriter his return after his massive commercial breakthrough success album channel orange this here this new album is an album people have been talking about have been waiting for ever since the release of channel orange have you been asking me if i know when the record is going to come out is if i have some kind of inside info on mr. ocean but the truth is that just about everybody in the music industry was totally clueless as to when this new record was going to come out to the point where numerous rumors and endless misinformation were spread all across the internet and these got so bad that once this mysterious cryptic little live stream of like a warehouse popped up on Frank ocean's website the idea that the album might just be around the corner was totally unbelievable now this livestream is eventually what ended up becoming the endless visual album that was released just about 24 hours before this new blonde record the album that I'm guessing was formerly boys don't cry could be wrong on that if I am leave a pissed off comment down there in the comments thanks now since endless and since blonde were released so close to one another I mean I think it could have been spread out just a little bit more but since they were released so close to one another didn't really see a point in doing a whole second video just a review and go in-depth about endless especially since my opinion on the project is pretty cut-and-dry endless is an indulgent and purposefully obtuse art project commissioned by Apple to get buzz built up for this new record get social media accounts updating get people talking get bloggers blogging I'm not even going to sit here and pretend to care about a bunch of guys sawing wood and welding while wearing designer sweaters but what was good about endless was the music with the exception of the very odd and new wavy device control at the very end of the project that had kind of this driving synthetic beat and these awkward lyrics about live-streaming yo life the rest of the record was really pretty and ethereal it was like this very modern but stripped back take on soul and pop music and while it did seem kind of casual and off-the-cuff and not exactly well organized or punchy I thought the sound of it was pleasant Frank ocean's vocals were gorgeous a lot of the time on endless vocally I think Frank started to show some real maturity maturity that wasn't necessarily there on channel Orange especially during some of those killer falsettos which he hadn't quite explored to the depths that he was on endless so with a more impressive vocal range being shown and the potential for a different sound maybe a more subtle low-key easygoing sound I was looking forward to just seeing what direction Frank took blond in and it definitely is a different album from channel orange and does carry over quite a few of the moods and the sonic pallets from endless it's not as airy or as loose as endless and that's a good thing I think anything more mellow than what we actually ended up getting here would have been a little bit too much of a stretch for fans still blonde is pretty strict back in comparison with channel Orange especially considering that they're long ambitious tracks on that album such as pyramids it's strict back in comparison to Frank ocean's many contemporaries as well instead of huge and complicated instrumentals and explosive choruses blonde finds power in simplicity and raw emotion the instrumentals and the ballads on this thing a lot of the time are pretty modest so modest to the point where somebody who's looking for something a little more extravagant might think that there's really nothing special going on here there may not be any pyrotechnics on this record but I still find a lot of what Frank is doing on here pretty adventurous there are moments where I'm reminded less of Frank's R&B contemporaries and more of indie artists like Bon Iver on this thing like on the kind of warble II and demo quality good guy interlude or at the end of the track white Ferrari where we have like this acoustic break down with some faint rock samples going on in the background that I can't quite place and this musical change of pace and these influences these sounds none of them should really be a surprise considering the strange and eclectic list of credits Frank put on this record that sort of leaked online came with something people were picking up at like this pop-up shop a series of pop-up shops rather in support of the release of the record names were listed such as Jamie xx and James Blake and Kanye and Kendrick Lamar Pharrell understandable names also there is an Andre 3000 listed on this thing he has a very obvious amazing and intense feature on the solo reprise but that we have eyebrow raisers like Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead Brian Eno Gang of Four and artists that aren't even currently around right now we have the Beatles and Elliott Smith as well as David Bowie I'm not really sure in what capacity these artists are incorporated into the record or they're subtle samples I'm missing are there interpolations of their songs into these tracks that sort of whizzed by me did they sort of take part in another capacity and the list goes on the feature list on this thing is is a long list but you wouldn't think all these names and faces went into this project given just how low-key it is not to call these songs uneventful but on each track Frank only includes what he needs and nothing that he doesn't now this record kicks off with song nike's admittedly not my favorite in the track listing maybe my least favorite track could possibly be because of the pitched chipmunk to lead vocals on the beginning of the song that lasts way too long and fit kind of awkwardly against the like 808 drums that are very slow very steady very watery synthesizers on this track to the chipmunk vocals don't really add anything to the narrative in my opinion as Frank sort of seems to be singing from the same standpoint here that he is later in the track when he's sort of in his normal range of voice and the track doesn't really have a strong narrative either as it's kind of like a salad of references to Frank's recent experiences current states with maybe a few faint statements on love and materialism and there are a couple other tracks on here that I find to be kind of similar as Frank is sort of flipping through a bunch of random thoughts against a kind of pretty watery instrumental song skyline - or the closer mood Emil acts Adina still though I guess this introductory track does a decent job of setting the tone for the very easygoing record and it's not really a big worry for me because the album starts dishing out very focused and very high-quality songs right away with the track IV a track that's mostly propelled by these very quiet driving guitars that sound like something off of an XX record Frank's lyrics about falling in love as a younger self are delivered in this really innocent this really boyish voice and he gains a lot of fire and passion in his vocal delivery on the chorus and I love all the lyrics about wanting to but not being able to go back to that time he was younger when this love that he's singing about still existed the song pink and white has one of the most glamorous instrumentals on the entire record with beautiful string sections and a kind of little bubbly bassline boop boop some crisp drums all set to this 3/4 time signature and Beyonce delivers some very faint reverb background vocals that that blossom beautifully as the song moves along in the second half of the track again one of the most glamorous instrumentals on the record here the track goes over well Frank is singing about these experiences and these things he's been taught by lovers in the past that he's sort of holding on to sort of a piece of these people he's dated stay with him forever because he has learned things from these people then we have an odd little detour about Frank's mom telling him not to do drugs it's like a bit of a voicemail or something that made it on to the record it's cute though maybe the message isn't completely clear or why this thing was included wasn't completely clear to me at least during my first handful of lessons because they're numerous references on this record to doing drugs like right after on the song solo where he's talking about being on tabs of acid but they're also references to not doing drugs on here I believe there's a line where Frank is singing about not having smoked for a year or something and at a lot of the points on the record where Frank is singing about doing drugs it seems as if he's kind of referencing a moment in his past so maybe these are all recent realizations that he's made and he's finally taking his mother's advice to heart which might be the case when you look at a song like nights for example where toward the back end of the track Frank seems to be singing about how his lifestyle burning the candle at both ends is really wearing on him this might have had something to do with maybe this album being delayed so often as he sort of seems to be singing about getting his life together and it doesn't sound like he's singing about the distant past it sounds like the very recent past then we move on to the song solo definitely top 5 favorite track on the album really top 3 for me love the constantly shifting organ chords on this thing which on like something out of a little Church or something but the chord progression is very jazzy very fresh one of Frank's best vocal performances on the entire record and contains a mix of not only singing but also you know like some spoken word just a tone of voice that sounds like he's rapping or about to rap and the lyrics on this thing are clever as well and sort of talks about a solo in a bunch of different contexts like either you're hitting a solo like sort of stealing the spotlight or getting attention your solo in terms of trying to get with somebody because you don't want to be alone or you want to fly solo toward the back end of the track when he's talking about this instance where this guy's going to the courts to try to get separated from his baby mama through child support payments also one line on this track that stuck out to me was one about avoiding highways which could be interpreted in a bunch of different ways but the way that I took it is that he is avoiding highways to avoid the fast lane stay out of the public eye just kind of live the personal and the low-key life that he wants to live he doesn't want his fame to sort of take over and sort of suck up every waking moment of his existence the song self-control is another stellar track in the track listing here with it's kind of slick dry electric guitar chords that are really sensual had a lot of swagger the rest of the instrumentation that pops in later in the track is super soft it's slick it's beautiful it sneaks in so quietly you barely notice it and then all of a sudden once it's all there it's kind of like a big sad crying party and the lyrics on this track another moment where I love the lyrics where Frank is singing about not really being with this person anymore but hoping he's remembered by this individual and singing about toward the back end of the track kind of being a placeholder sleeping in between these two people being that remembered past lover that oh someone never really gets over and then we have the very unsettling song pretty sweet which has Frank singing wildly over this chaotic wall of what sounds like strings and since it's pretty crazy definitely one of the most experimental and wild things I've heard on a record this popular in a long time also the really peppy percussion at this point in the track of ginger and the the very fast bass line this track plays into this really unpredictable moment on the record that I like quite a bit Frank is kind of realizing how his life decisions are hurting him on the song nights we have that intense Andre 3000 feature which features some amazing lyrics we have the weird close to you interlude track which features an interpolation of the Carpenters song of the same title and we have the Facebook story skit as well there are so many risks on this album at various points but they're quiet risks so they might not be just hitting you over the head and they're pretty refreshing in my opinion even if a couple of them come off as somewhat random or just kind of unfinished ideas the album gains its composure once again and starts dishing out more fleshed out and more coherent songs though they are some of the most structurally and sonically odd in the entire tracklist like the dreamy white Ferrari or the track Siegfried which has some amazing string arrangements and rap passages as well and then we have the emotionally stunning godspeed which has a gospel vibe to it that ends the album off or almost ends the album off really well and then we have the closer which I'm still kind of indifferent toward don't care about the vocal delivery that much don't care about the instrumental that much the only thing I find kind of interesting about the track are some of Frank's lyrics as he's singing directly to his mother and also in a way his fans obviously and kind of giving everybody an update on all these recent thoughts and experiences that he's had the only glaring issue to me about this record is that it ends and starts a little weak the rest of the record though is loaded with incredible highlights fantastic songs or little detours that are so weird and unexpected that I can't help but find them stimulating anyway the entire album has a supremely weird flow to it it sort of seems to get stranger and more experimental and more I guess unhinged as it moves along but it always stays low-key beautiful and subtle occasionally it feels a little unorganized but I think that only plays into the character of the album that has this really potent humanity to it a lot of this album is like reading into the personal diary of someone who you're really curious about or you really care about or you're really infatuated with which is Frank Ocean in a nutshell for the past several years people have been nothing but obsessed with and infatuated with Frank Ocean and have been nothing but waiting for this new record over here so in a lot of respects I think Frank not only pleased me and came out with what I think musically and lyrically and instrumentally is a great record but I think simultaneously pleased his fans and kind of gave them what they wanted it definitely impressed me I guess the only issue that wasn't an issue for me but something that I hope isn't an issue for other people is that I just kind of crossed my fingers and hope that a lot of people didn't find the music too sleepy or too uneventful on this album because if you are a more patient listener I think you are going to find a lot of things to like about this project I'm feeling a decent of strong eight on this thing transition and there you have it my thoughts on the new Frank Ocean record great record definitely going to be a highlight of the year for me and yeah that's it guys what do you think about this album did you leather did you hate it why what do you think I should have you next and that's it Anthony Fantana Frank Ocean forever "},{"id":"sj-0ya-ePq0","title":"William Basinski - A Shadow In Time ALBUM REVIEW","y":7,"x":"hey what up everybody it's jeans mini-jack tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new William Basinski album a shadow in time this is the latest full-length album from composer ambient music composer multi-instrumentalist avant-garde music composer William Basinski most well known for his four-part series the disintegration loops and while shadow in time doesn't seem to be connected to those works his most legendary works in any way conceptually Williams familiar style of layering and looping all of these sounds hypnotically on top of each other is very much present on this new record he does so for about 40 minutes to 20 minute tracks on this record both of which have their own distinct flavor on the album the opening track is titled for David Robert Jones obviously a David Bowie tribute which sticks out mostly because of its distorted ghostly melodies and distant reverb so sax loops the repetitions of these loops are very clear but Williams sort of warps and makes the mix very woozy on this track in such a way it just kind of puts me in a lull where while I'm listening to I'm really in no rush for it to finish as the song nears its finish he adds some deep sub bass into the mix so there's like a nice even basic Rumble going on in the track the title track on this thing features a much smoother more even drone with layer upon layer of a cereal airy tones kind of cascading over one another slowly gently sliding into the mix popping out of the wall of sound that's behind it and then kind of slowly fading back into it William progresses the drone into a series of movements where he emphasizes different frequencies the drone itself eventually evaporates and gives away to this very lonely distant piano passage which is very beautiful and is not just a good ending to the track but to the album itself this album doesn't seem to be as bogged down in process as I've known previous Basinski albums to be and if it was it's not really all that apparent because it does feel like on these tracks he was legitimately trying to compose music and what was driving that composition his heart his emotions his creative mind not so much an experiment he had in mind or or a weird experimental rule because the movements that these tracks made felt very conscious like he was trying to give these songs just enough progression to the point where on a cerebral level it's very clear that you know there's movement happening something's going on there's a reason to stick around with this even if on the surface level what you're listening to appears to be incredibly minimal there was something about these tracks that I had a hard time placing though and that was the emotional quality of these songs and not that Basinski is famous for the most emotionally charged music ever to be recorded not really the case but I feel like what he's provided the listener on this project is an emotional canvas of sorts with both of these tracks there's an even balance of sounds and texture neither of the two tracks or the movements within the tracks are so gloomy and dreary that they could be misconstrued as depressing nor are they so airy and bright that they could be called purely blissful either I think the feeling is you pull out of these tracks are the feelings that you project onto these tracks which is kind of an interesting accomplishment from my point of view as most ambient music I hear either sways clearly in one way or the other or is trying its best to be emotionally neutral live up to that Eno ideal of musics answer to furniture but since keys efforts here feel a little more engaging than that his approach to texture is far from bland and both of these tracks feature clear elements of progression and tension without straying too far away from those tenets of ambient and drone music those tenants I would say are what William lives up to best on this project because the way he layers and loops sounds on this thing it gives the satisfying feeling of endlessness sort of like I'm using my ears to stare into infinity again what's here is a little emotionally ambiguous but not to say that there's a lack of emotion here what you get out of this thing is what you want to pull out of this thing or maybe what he's given us is not just a canvas as I said earlier but maybe some kind of emotional mirror because as far as interpretation goes I think you go a lot of different directions with these two tracks I like this album I think it's pretty good I wouldn't call it the most innovative or unique ambient or experimental music I've ever heard in my life certainly not and while I do think there is a strong element of emotion to this record it's also quite methodical too there is something kind of cold about it for sure I would encourage any fans of experimental and ambient music to give this project a shot it's most likely going to go down as one of the more notable projects in those genres in 2017 and not just because of the name attached to it also because it is a quality project and even people who aren't familiar with Basinski x' work I think could easily get into this because a shadow in time a rank is one of his more accessible albums - as it's 40 minute runtime doesn't really demand all that much from a newbie but also I think that leaves the the flow and the overall I guess satisfaction rating for me on this album a little lower than I would like it to be - as the impact of this thing isn't really that great to me and I know I'm saying that about an ambient release but I'm considering that I know I'm feeling in light - decent 7 on this album chore transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

REVIEW","y":6,"x":"backstreet's back alright hey everyone Anthony Pantano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ARCA album mutant arca is the pseudonym of one experimental electronic music producer this is his second full-length album you might remember him from some previous collaborations he has been tied to singers as such as kalila as well as FK twigs Bjork had some production on her latest album he also worked with Kanye West on some production on his yeezus album then shortly after he dropped a pretty perplexing but somewhat underwhelming full-length debut album titled Zen which was super abstract but maybe didn't spend enough time pulling me into the the very odd world that it seemed like this music was coming from but on this new album on the surface it would seem that that problem has been alleviated with the fact that this record is 20 minutes longer than its predecessor with more expansive track lengths more tracks and a few strange interludes spread out among 20 songs and there's not really that much more to talk about in terms of background with this thing which sort of makes sense in a way because Arcas music has always sounded like it comes from a weird context 'less void that doesn't have much in the way of connections to traditional or popular music and I think that's even more the case on this new record over here as many of the tracks on this thing drift further away from the elements of more conventional electronic music that showed up on Zen arca has replaced those elements of electronic dance music and hip hop and glitch hop with something that is just purely about sound play this record is vivid it is textural I think there are notes of Tim Hecker in this track listing I think there are notes of OneNote Rick's point never in this track listing but I think ARCA is going for something way more abstract kind of industrial flavored on some of these tracks and pretty experimental and challenging there are tons of shrill tones on this record fractured disconnected musical passages heavy powerful overwhelming percussion and bass chunks of noise brittle fuzz and distortion vast open never-ending atmospheres the music is a mix of frightening pretty and perplexing making it really hard to kind of settle into and kind of relax while listening to anything that ARCA is doing on this album the moment I think I'm starting to figure a track out arca sort of pulls me back toward the edge of my seat as he kind of turns into another direction introduces some weird abrasive new sounds or shattering moments of complete silence with stuttering basin and shrill loops on the title track to this thing eventually the song develops into something a little bit more easygoing and coherent with these slower prettier very smooth synth chords but even during its most subtle and nuanced moments this record is pretty unsettling even on the song vanity not one of the louder tracks and the track listing here it's loaded with these really shy explorative melodies but even here this melody it just sounds so whacked-out and hideous and not hideous and oh this is awful music type of hideous hideous in the way where I feel like I've paid admission to walk into some kind of musical freak show which makes the title of this record all the more fitting there are some songs on here that I don't remember for their musical qualities but for what they evoke in me image wise like the song sinner where I hear sense that sound like a police siren these really weird metallic noises that read like chain-link fences or dragged chains the song contrasts greatly to the track anger which has these fuzzy distorted loud synth leads that are swapping places constantly with these snippets of music could be samples of music that sounds like it could have come from Arcas home country of Venezuela and there are all these strange harps Kord ish cents on the song sever where it's like ARCA is purposefully placing a lot of sour notes into these chords but I can almost make out what the notes and the chords are supposed to be again it's like a listening to something purposefully miss shapen or mutated it's like the song is alive it's not this human created thing it's alive and it's trying to figure itself out or it is just thinking to itself why am i alive I've said a lot about these songs so far and I feel like I could say more but we're only 1/3 into the album's runtime thus far and that's how dense overwhelming and sometimes unpredictable this album can be and Arco doesn't exactly let up deeper into the album either I think it's pretty safe to say that people who merely know ARCA for the production that he's placed onto other people's albums might not enjoy what goes on here because this is nowhere near as accessible or pop-oriented as a lot of that stuff the music that ARCA does solo is way more indulgent and so much more about diving into a world where it seems like he doesn't have the opportunity to elsewhere he's not making songs again as much as he is erecting digital skyscrapers in a glitched out post-apocalyptic matrix though eventually arcus formula about halfway into the record does become a little more apparent as he continually blends these eerie very tiny miss shapen highs and mids with monstrous just completely unpredictable bass and percussion that just pops out like a serial killer and a slasher flick there are some songs in the middle of this record where it seems arca is taking a more conventional approach like on the song front load which feels like a fusion of Boards of Canada and effects twin it's very much an eidm oriented track I think the only track in the middle of the record that I was really grabbed by was most likely the song umbilical which is super noisy super cacophonous and very rhythmic as well and features these really stand out vocal samples oh there are a lot of moments deeper into this record that I think are inch reading I think are strange I'll give it that but I don't really have much in the way of a motion for it I guess when it gets to songs like gratitude in the song n I feel like we've transitioned from making really interesting experimental compositions to just delivering all these really indulgent exercises where no one single moment seems any more significant than the other which was partially an issue that I had on Arcas last album as well the cacophony eventually just sounds like a completely purposeless hodgepodge and I appreciate the challenge but even ARCA himself I think stops exploring this musical world he's established by the halfway point of the album and doesn't continue to introduce new sounds vibes and emotions into the recipe I thought this record was okay I think it is really out there it is pretty strange and I think if you want to be challenged I think if you want your mind bent a little bit try this thing out but beyond some of the inspiring sound design I don't really feel like there's anything with this album that's going to stick with me for the long term because a lot of the experiments on here while it's there definitely left-field they just kind of sound like I don't know just short-term thrills for me hopefully what ARCA has done on this record is a little more meaningful to you though I'm feeling a decent strong six on this transition have you given the sound will listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it let me know your thoughts on this thing it loved it more than me did it did it penetrate into your mind and and just kind of like go or were you just kind of like yeah let me know antwuan fan tuan forever "},{"id":"hgryNZz-34Q","title":"Manchester Orchestra- Simple Math ALBUM REVIEW","y":4,"x":"Manchester Orchestra hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd red sweater Manchester Orchestra simple math flex your head jar of water it's time for an album review Manchester Orchestra is a jaja band and this is their latest LP simple math and these guys play a style of rock music I could only really call indie rock not necessarily because these guys are difficult to pin down but they so willingly pin themselves within that style of music and I know indie rock is a really broad term but Manchester Orchestra kind of makes me nostalgic for a time when I used to listen to Death Cab for Cutie and bright eyes and dismemberment plan and a little bit of Built to Spill a little bit of Wilco Grandaddy Modest Mouse you know a time when listening to underground music got you called emo instead of hipster like today now even though indie is a broad term all of those bands I mentioned are a good representation of the style of music these guys try to recreate the band's last album was a little bit cleaner a little more produced than the previous one I'm like a virgin losing a child but Manchester Orchestra still maintained their passion and energy as a rock band a simple math is where I'm starting to wonder if they really have that anymore maybe indie rock just isn't what it used to be or just this style of it I kind of feel like it's wrinkles are showing their flashes here of Manchester orchestras past like on the track Pensacola which comes together like a really strong catchy power pop tune a lot of downstroke guitars fun group choruses great lyrics and melodies and a really triumphant horn part at the end but a lot of these tracks here suffer from I don't know a lack of modesty maybe a little bit too much ambition or something I guess I like my the rock to be a little bit more earnest or down-to-earth so many songs here are just slathered in strings and booming guitars and this false sense of drama there are some spots some spots here where I do connect a lot of passion with the building instrumentation like on the end of the title track here which doesn't really drown itself out in these extra louder sounds the song kind of progresses into those sounds and once it gets to those sounds the climax is pretty moving but I'm left kind of underwhelmed by most of what's going on here mighty April Fool virgin pale black eye those tracks to me are too wrapped up in either how loud they are how stylistically different they are from the album because I hear some like 90s alternative rock riffs in there or they're wrapped up in there extra instrumentation to the point where I'm just not really hearing an interesting song or an interesting style just kind of this relative relative heaviness at this point in their career I just kind of feel like Manchester Orchestra is merely working with indie rocks most accessible aspects and then layering strings and horns over it they've basically taken everything out of indie rock that was so groundbreaking in the first place which kind of makes it a very unmemorable record for me there are some decent Tunes here and there but I do not see myself returning to this like ever I'm kind of feeling a strong four to a light five on this album I could see why it's getting popular I could see why people are digging it but it's it's not for me but what do you think of this thing love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Manchester Orchestra forever you "},{"id":"vdmzHJ8QsJs","title":"Regina Spektor - Remember Us To Life ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone sniffing things in aptana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Regina Spektor album remember us to life New York via Russia singer-songwriter Regina Spektor this I believe is her seventh full-length album she's been at it for years but this is the first time I'm doing like a formal Regina Spektor album review why why why why why why why I used to really love Regina's music originally I caught her doing an opening set at a Dresden Dolls show years ago what's so funny oh nothing hey nothing wrong with a little cabaret gap punk piano rack Punk I know that it's ICP for theater majors I'm willing to admit that well at this live show I instantly fell for Regina's voice her piano playing her quirky lyrics and songwriting on albums like Soviet Kitsch and 1111 and song she was as funny as she was captivating and romantic but I soon found myself sort of falling out of favor with her music as she gained more popularity like on her album begin to hope back in 2006 a lot of people seemed enamored with this record but I didn't really care for the way that the trendier production on this album sort of constrained her songwriting down and rendered it into sort of a more straightforward pop flavor the beats and the cents on a lot of tracks from this record were a total turnoff for me and while her following two records weren't really all that bad I didn't see them as consistent as her previous works that I had enjoyed so much then a few years ago I remember really falling in love with her new single you've got time which was a song that she had composed specifically for orange is the new black as the show's theme song and you could just write this song off as an intro to a very popular television show but I actually think it's one of her better tracks in years the tension building and the vocals and the unrelenting pianos on this track are fantastic and I love the way that her lyrics say a lot without giving too much away this song confirmed for me that there's still that fire in her that I remember from her 2000s early 2000s era music so much and I was kind of hoping for a new full-length record where she ignites that again and I think remember us - life does exactly that this album isn't a huge change of pace from what Regina has been doing on her past couple of records fans of those I think will undoubtedly enjoy this but she just seems on with this record like super focused and super consistent on the 11 tracks on this thing there's not a dud among these songs and even the bonus tracks on the deluxe version are fired every aspect of Regina's music just seems supercharged on this record from the heartbreaking stories the passion of vocal performances the wit the dynamic piano playing and it's all amplified with some huge backing instrumentation like some great lavish thick dense string sections and some great bass & pianos this is like the biggest instrumental presentation I think Regina has brought forth on a record thus far and it gives her a real theatrical edge on a lot of these cuts like on the song sellers of roses where she dramatically sings about the winner in this equation of purchasing flowers as a gift it's not the roses it's not the sellers it's not the buyers she sings about the sellers actually picking up old roses and picking off the old wilted petals and then using those to sell and then the roses are dead the next day it's such a small moment in life to sing about but she gives it so much weight the song obsolete is equally grand and pretty heartbreaking when you dive into the lyrics where she's singing about her love her heart becoming old becoming useless the song tornado land is very large and very showy as well and moves through a series of instrumental shifts that are kind of like very stage II Musical costume changes and on the trapper and the furrier Regina employs some of the most biting and satirical lyrics on the entire record singing about these duo's of people the trapper and the furrier the lawyer and the pharmacist the manager and the owner kind of working together to screw over other people or exploit the world around them as on the chorus she sings about the strange world that we live in how those who don't have have things taken away from them and those who do have are given the album isn't all doom and gloom though on the song older and taller Regina brings her upbeat charms with a really funny refrain where she's talking about being told to enjoy your youth like a threat there are tons of little funny turns of phrase all over this track about life's many ironies and and being sort of sentimental about your memories and people you care about and the closing track to this record the visit is such a heartwarming song one of the most heartwarming songs have heard in a long time Regina kicks the song off literally singing about how she's so happy that this person who she has in mind stopped by she sings about how she hasn't seen this person in years there are all sorts of sweet gentle melodies all over this thing the song is like the equivalent of I don't know like tea and sweet biscuits and everything sitting on doilies the song is like so dainty and adorable I've never I think used those words to describe a song while the song small bills takes a really huge risk with a booming funky drumbeat and piano groove and Regina's vocals on this tracker almost rapping as she's singing about this person wasting money on coca-cola and weed and Lucy's and so on and so forth she has all these little refrains interjecting between these verses and deeper into the song the track becomes more and more about losing money wasting money other people trying to get your money from you and I want to mention the song black and white too because it is such a lovely and tender piece of songwriting it reminds me of a artists like Nico or Joni Mitchell it's just such a beautiful moving tune whose melody just sticks with me it haunts me if you don't like this track if you're not like at least a little moved by this track I don't trust you you know I really don't trust you like if I had given you a knife or something I wouldn't turn around you might stab me and the other cuts in the tracklisting don't disappoint either I mean on the song the light the heavenly chorus on this track the way Regina's vocals and the strings come together is really blissful really pretty even the opening track which features these synthetic beats and you know of course these synth leads which I don't really care for when she's working with them I'm so enamored with the song itself it ultimately doesn't matter also the quaint storytelling of the song Grand Hotel again not a track I'm disappointed with even really underwhelmed by in the track listing here which is surprising because that's typically been the case for Regina's past several records and again there's not a huge overhaul of Regina's sound on the album at all it's just like the writing and the performances and the instrumental presentation are a little bit sharper a little bit better so you know if you've been kind of discounting Regina's past couple of Records as well don't let this one slip by you I know it might not seem like the difference between this and her recent material is night and day but uh to me it really is in a lot of ways I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate here that best year the best what should I review next and hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this album but feel free to leave a comment also there's stuff next to my head click on it Regina Spektor new album for forever "},{"id":"oX56GvWAGY8","title":"Young Fathers - White Men Are Black Men Too ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"no no you just hi everyone Anthony out tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new young father's album white men are black men too young fathers one of the most standout Scottish musical acts to come out in the past several years some of their earliest music the music they really started to catch buzz on featured blends of hip hop pop soul music sort of filtered through a lo-fi lens occasionally these songs would be backed by African rhythms or like some rap verses or maybe some really great vocal harmonies off of their debut tape young fathers caught the ears of anti Khan records where they ended up signing with them releasing tape to the sequel to tape one where they pretty much had the same sound but delivered a series of just as quality songs as what was on the first tape and after tape 2 they would eventually release what I kind of see is their big commercial debut they did it through big Dada records as well the album dead a record that saw the trio making kind of a cleaner slightly catchy er version of what they were doing on their previous two tapes and even though I think there were good intentions behind this album I found a lot of the instrumentals on this LP to be kind of just repetitive the beats here just really kind of got stale before the song was even over but even though I was kind of indifferent and on the fence with this LP this album did manage to drum up more attention for the Scottish trio and it actually won them a Mercury Prize as well so I mean they were doing something right and with this new album essentially young fathers are continuing to experiment and challenge which i think is great is is actually pretty refreshing not only does this new LP over here come with some very bold and head-turning album art but the music and the musical style of this album as well is a bit of a change in a shift for young fathers white men is not a cleanly produced affair that Dead was young fathers embraces lo-fi once again with this album they head back into grimy er smudgy ER sonic territory and there's not much on this LP in the way of hip-hop either there are some verses and some spoken word here and there but mostly on this record we see young fathers kind of resting on their pop and their soul talents which isn't necessarily a bad thing because the more pop and soul oriented songs of tape 1 and tape 2 or some of my favorite moments on those projects and if young fathers can pull together 10 or 12 songs in that stylistic vein why not now personally I really like this record I think this is a great record in a way sort of a bit of a return to form for young fathers but I wouldn't be surprised if I were to find that a lot of people who were big on dead this album didn't click with them as much the kind of noisy and obscured vocals and drums all over this album kind of keep the songs here from translating on first listen there are some tracks in the track listing here that I think are a little bit more instantaneous than others like the song shame which has a cute little beat to it with a little bitty synth bassline and some tambourine and some drums it's really stripped back it's very simple but with these very simple elements young fathers come through with a lot of texture and a lot of magic and I love the vocal parts on this track and the way the song carries along it's not so much like a clean-cut verse chorus verse type track but more of a continued groove that I get kind of charmed by and and lost in the longer it continues and the song 27 which has some of the best singing and one of the best vocal melodies on the entire LP here even though there's a lot of dirt on the instrumentation with this LP with the piano phrase and the layered vocals on this track there's just a lot of joy and just a lot of Hope in this song and the song rain or shine as well which features some driving drum and bass as well as some just kind of non-stop eerie creepy but also sort of quirky organ chords there's some spoken word in the tract as well and it's another song here the features kind of a linear structure the the song either kind of changes part suddenly or it just continually builds tension on a single idea that just continues to repeat and it's because of tracks like this that I think instantly charm that if you repeat this out another time another time the other songs will kind of grow on you like they did with me like what the song gets started which is the closing track here one of the most climactic tracks on the LP really fitting for a closer and this song features just more sound and instrumentation than any other track here at least from what I can hear and all the sounds are just smudging and bleeding into one another to create this wall a very rich triumphant but also kind of dreamy instrumentation the song nest kind of feels like with this really awesome piano lead like young fathers take on old-school soul or Motown music and with sirens we kind of get this lyrical look at police violence as well as God and instrumentally on this track while it is as simple as a lot of the other songs here that the very few elements that do work their way into this track are wonderful especially the layers of strings on the song which are gorgeous typically you don't expect such refined instrumentation to be going into such a low five album but don't let this albums kind of grimy aesthetic throw you off because there is really beautiful stuff going on beyond the noise and the and the muck and with the song old rock and roll we kind of had a theme of things not being what they seem and with the lyrics here young fathers not only make reference to the album title but they kind of blur racial lines as well this is one of the few moments on this LP that isn't just a ballad either they kind of flirt with hip hop with some spoken word and some verses on this track but it's just really a hard-hitting booming beat here and I don't want to have anybody scared off by the title of this album either I just want to say that even though a record with this on the front might read to you as like oh man this is going to be really and just trying to shove some kind of ideology down my throat I guess what I'm trying to say is they talk about things like race on this album in a very artful and smart and nuanced way they're not just handing you this laundry list of I think this and I think this and I think this and a lot like with that Kendrick Lamar album that dropped not too long ago the music is actually really great on this album so yeah while there is in a sense a message the music is not neglected in order to get that message out there but the one downside there is to this album is that maybe young fathers went a little too far in that low five direction especially for songs on here that that are so melodically rich there are a few tracks on the back end of this LP that have very abrupt endings and and are maybe just a little disappointing because of that but it's really the the mixing and the cacophony of the instrumentation here that I think holds some of these songs back from feeling as big as maybe they were hoping to be like the song liberated for example which despite all of its vocal layering just feels kind of small and just stunted at least a little bit and the song John Doe - which has a sweet melody to it some catchy lyrics a little good times row as you know as well as that reference with with the right instrumentation this track really could have been one of the hardest rocking songs on the entire LP but instead it just remains kind of mild instrumental and just kind of hangs in the yellow and and I do really like the tune though however I just kind of see this as another moment on this album where young fathers are taking pop music themes and ideas and doing some weird and some subversive things with it kind of in the same way that you might have a guy like Ariel pink or a band like women and young fathers is another act on this album who just are making pop music but they're kind of intentionally throwing a wrench in the works and that maybe with an abrupt ending or with kind of an obscure door hidden chorus or with just the general low fire recording of this entire album and even though it may take away from a few tracks I think the kind of fuzzy tattered production of this album adds more character than takes away I think white men are black men too is essentially a really nice lo-fi pop album with a lot going for it in terms of sound in terms of songwriting quality and as well as just a really interesting blend of musical styles even though I do sort of define this as a pop album it really does defy categorization in a lot of ways there really are a lot of popular music styles blended into this album though you might not necessarily notice them on first listen because they're all brought together and tied up very nicely in the very grimey production of this album I'm feeling a light a decent eight on this LP transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fanta no young fathers forever "},{"id":"-obIKHZvohA","title":"Michael Cera - True That ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"hi everyone Mantha me bro tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Michael Cera album true that Michael Cera is an actor multi-instrumentalist songwriter he hails from Ontario Canada at this point I don't think I need to list out all the successful TV shows and movies that he has played key roles in because if they didn't exist I probably wouldn't have gotten a large influx of requests to review this album this album which he has dropped out of the blue on Bandcamp true that it is 17 original tracks a cover a lot of tinny lo-fi odds and ends there's some indie folk tunes on here some piano pieces instrumentals either this album is the quaintest soundtrack I've heard in years and the movie is just on the way has been put out yet it's still in production or this record is just a bunch of musical loose change Michael had jangling around in his pockets and even though there's nothing really game-changing in the tracklist of this record there are some highlights like the sort of wonky guitar intro it's got a three four time signature really eerie melody definitely sets the tone of the album and then there is a cover version of blaze Folies clay pigeons not a song I'm terribly familiar with but it sticks out very plainly as a cover with its steady finger picking and ethereal pianos and really sharp melodies sharp lyrics poetic lyrics as well as clear structure it's easily the most coherent song on the entire LP which really makes us stick out like a sore thumb in the tracklist and by default kind of makes it the best song in the entire record there are a few other acoustic ballads in the tracklist here but they are nowhere near as memorable or as immediate tracks like Oh Nadine and steady now and the song Ruth which may in fact be the the saddest story that Michael Cera pens on this record all these songs are way too weak voiced and gently strung they're too faint to faint melodically structurally when it to the performance as well there's the song what gives which is kind of a sour strange little one-minute rock track that kind of sounds like a unicorns demo unicorns being abandoned not really surprised Michael Cera might be into given that he has played bass for mr. heavenly which does have a unicorns connection to me the brightest spots on the entire LP are the instrumentals are the little piano pieces and that may in fact be because the the the expectations are lower it's not like there's anything big to expect in terms of structure from these tracks it's not like there's a lyrical component to these tracks so Michael Sarah's voice which is maybe one of his weakest points on this record isn't really showcased and for the most part these instrumentals are very cute they are very as I said before quaint they're sweet they are loosely performed they're rickety they're endearing they're relaxing there's the piano piece go she's kiss which is very nice the humdrum track the guitar piece on that song is very cute even though there are some sour guitar notes on the song here and there the song 20/40 another track in 3/4 if you give it a listen to this album you will hear that Michael Cera does love that time signature and this is a little drum machine keyboard piece at least it sounds like drum machine I can't really tell with just how bad the recording is but it's got this sputtering little beat some very charming keyboards and I really like the song Old Grey Whistle as well with these really grand rich saloon-style piano chords matched with some acoustic guitar it's really just a mixed bag of hit or miss songs there's no overarching theme or anything to really pull these songs together outside of just the generally subpar recording I'm kind of feeling a 5 on this album like a light decent 5 and you know what I don't really think Michael Cera had any ambition beyond making an album of that quality because he sounds like a hobbyist which is totally fine there's nothing wrong with being a hobbyist many of them send me their music however I don't review it I don't point it out to you guys until these are to sound like they've got their shit together they sound like they know what makes for a catchy immediate time spanning or interesting song until it sounds like they're putting together a professional grade or interesting recording I know that lo-fi is a genre now and that people have gotten past the idea that you need to have a good clean recording in order to give fans I understand that and I like that it's great that you don't need to have a recording as clean as like a Nickelback record in order to get listeners but from my perspective what really puts Michael Cera above any of these hobbyists that may be sending me their music at any point throughout the week aside from the fact that he's Michael Cera nothing I'm going to be 110 percent honest with you right now if this record blew your mind you don't need me you don't need any music journalism website currently in existence right now what you need to do is go on Bandcamp type in indie Foulke and you will have your mind blown numerous times over and over and over and over just like one musical mushroom cloud after another because there are so many internet albums that are floating around right now that are either at this level or higher in terms of songwriting or recording transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Michael Cera true that forever "},{"id":"DPeE28Fb_L8","title":"Danny Brown- XXX ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a review Danny Brown xxx aka 30 and I know this is a hip-hop review I'm sure I'm going to see some comments that are all like the needle drop reviews too much hip-hop when I can't help but the hip hop is killing it this year I can't help that I'm just following my ears you know what do you want me to review so a lot of people have been asking me to review this thing and I'm glad I checked it out I'm glad I did I might have actually slept on this because the first time I ever heard of Danny was last year when he came out with his album the hybrid he emailed me a page where I could stream the whole LP in full its it's an email I'm sure he sent to a lot of blogs he said something like pitchfork took a whack at my album you should too I liked his flow I was kind of into his voice at the time but I just had a hard time seeing what the big deal was I didn't like a lot of the beats on the album here's some tracks from some mixtapes that he's released before the hybrid but definitely after this there was some kind of revelation some kind of change outside of Danny Browns now kind of Skrillex looking haircut on 30 Danny is coming out with tracks that are really raw disturbing personal like almost too raw disturbing and personal to me this is kind of like hip hop's version of dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde but you get way more mr. Hyde than you do dr. Jekyll on the cell P Danny wraps about the usual kind of rap cliches you know just greed misogyny money violence bragging about himself about his mic skills making really kela similes everywhere but like the Death Grips album that came out earlier this year he takes all these ideas and brings them to such an extreme they kind of become parody it's a kind of cartoony embrace of drugs and violence that reminds me of Eminem back when he was kind of in his prime and when I say cartoony the dude does sound kinda silly and it's not just because Squidward is the first pop-culture reference on this album it's his voice he just has this really odd whiny inflection when he's rapping it's something he kind of puts on you know and it may take a little bit to adjust to it's not something that you you may necessarily just fall in love with on first listen but for me it was semi easy the way that he just throws his voice everywhere and just kind of sounds like he's going a little bit wilder than he really is kind of makes me think of him as a really skinny high-pitched old dirty bastard but during these more kind of dr. Jekyll moments on the album he is rapping in a more normal inflection a more accepted inflection this album is 19 tracks almost an hour and I'm not going to lie you may be tempted to turn it off as soon as it starts but if you're in hip-hop music stick with it because the full punch doesn't come until the end of the album when the bigger picture kind of comes into view on the first chunk of this album the beats are really sparse odd electronic a lot of atmospheric sense hanging in the background something I could almost hear like little be spitting over a little bit the track died like a rockstar has these really fuzzy bass notes hanging in the background and the lyrics on that track are pretty much about these excesses that Danny raps about kind of bringing him to an early end and that's the character he plays here the character is excessive but not necessarily stupid like on the track radio song which is a pretty clever piece of satire where Danny is pretty much spitting in the face of commercial rappers with a very Annoying hook intentionally annoying and the song bruiser Brigade comes out really violent almost in a parody of violence sounding kind of like a waka flocka flame track and even referencing him in the process but as weird as Danny gets I feel like maybe there's a little bit of Danny in all of us because he was pretty much reading my mind on the song I will the first part of it you got a listen to the tape to figure out what that songs about so as Danny comes out with this really eccentric personality he's droppin lines that are so hilariously quotable like the Virgin Mary snorting coke certain parts of the anatomy tasting and or smelling like Cool Ranch Doritos or tropical fruit skittles crapping on someone's mixtape literally giving a girl's jaw stretch marks and the beats match this weirdness like the weird bleep II blue penis on the track outer space or that very high-pitched noisy whine on Detroit 187 the party on this album though is kind of over once it all comes to a head when Danny drops a track referencing one of his favorite drugs adderall before that track the entire album was kind of like the high it was the high and after that everything just drops into a depression after this point Danny is rapping in a more normal inflection and he drops a track called DNA where he's rapping about how his addiction is like hereditary and kind of coming to terms with it rapping about losing family members and friends and pretty much like letting go of his life but I la I love the ending of this album where Danny is back to his weirder character he's back on the drugs he's having an emotional meltdown his entire life is melting down he's overdosing on pills paramedics are trying to revive him he's rapping about fool's gold finally signing him and it's just a really hectic ending to this thing on this LP there are a lot of moods Styles sounds layers and personality it comes on strong it comes on kind of weird to don't listen to this and just observe it at the surface scratch below interpret think observe and enjoy I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this I think it's great there were some tracks here that underwhelmed me a little bit toward the middle of the album but strong start and strong finish but what do you think of this thing loving it hating it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana dan brown forever you you "},{"id":"S9gg0JOTF2E","title":"JPEGMAFIA - Veteran ALBUM REVIEW","y":8,"x":"dummy dummy dummy dummy dummy here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a review of the new jpeg mafia album veteran this is the second full-length album from Baltimore rapper and producer jpg mafia aka Peggy whose music I've been aware of for a little while now communist slow jams black Ben Carson that collaborative EP project or whatever it was he had with freaky from which one of my favorite singles of 2016 came I might vote for Donald Trump previously Peggy has kind of been on the cutting edge of this recent movement of a very noisy abrasive experimental rap music but while his material was certainly admirable I didn't find it to be all that distinct so going into this new project over here veteran I didn't quite know what to expect I was just kind of crossing my fingers hoping for something fresher just kind of strolling into it because I was vaguely interested in his previous work and I got to say the dude did it on this album he did it this thing is 19 tracks it's 47 minutes and I was just overwhelmed by how sharp and textured and creative and experimental and off the beaten path and yet how catchy this record is in comparison with his last projects Peggy is definitely working with sounds that are a bit trendier this time around definitely more dynamic there are moments on this thing where a flow or a groove or a beat might remind me a little bit of what I might hear of like from little Ozzy Verte like from an Uzi vert project even a few moments where I heard like a touch of take Hays the race but again these seem like very mild influences sort of like Peggy is embracing these sounds as a means or as a vehicle to make a larger stranger artistic statement because while certainly there are whiffs of these more mainstream elements in his music the production and the song we hang and the lyricism is totally whacked but still definitely something I think fans of artists like the cool kids or especially clipping could certainly appreciate the lyrics on thing are kind of a mix of very self-aware like self-imposed ignorant raw absurdity dark humor and just unrelenting confrontation really confrontation with anything Peggy sets his sights on whether it be moderate Lib tardes or the alt-right misogynists as well as feminists the president bloggers soundcloud rappers overly sensitive white people I mean there are songs on this thing titled I cannot wait until Morrissey dies there's also a track on here titled my thoughts on neogaf dying and then the dejected repeated chorus on that track is I don't care I don't care of course this thing is littered with very odd strange references from Mortal Kombat to tinder the album's opening track contains a verse where he says that he wants a bitch with long hair like Mike C town Mike C town of dead and hip-hop when he said that when he said that line I felt it I felt it oh me too man to deeper into the album Peggy also promises to never go blonde like Kanye and fucka Johnny Rotten I want little B we'll probably go down as one of my favorite rap lines of 2018 but J pig mafias lyrics on this thing do go beyond funny bars and quotable one-liners there is an incredibly nihilistic satirical and very cutthroat tone to this album that I love it's just as heady as it is animalistic there's so many good things with this record I don't know I don't even know where to start I don't know where to start I mean there is the verse on baby I'm bleeding which is probably going to be one of the hardest things anybody hears all year there's a moment on the album where Peggy samples the legendary intro to the old dirty bastard song going down where he takes some of the throaty noises ol Dirty Bastard was making and obviously the and turns it into this like wild throat singing loop and just wraps over that relentlessly along with like these really strange fuddy drum hits there's kind of a watery guitar transition at one point that track2 it's one of the wildest instrumentals I've heard all year there's also the very off-kilter but sleek thug tears which features these sweetly some vocals with some light processing on them it sort of sounds like some alternative R&B from another reality there's also rock-and-roll is dead which features the strange popping samples soaked in reverb like cavernous reverb it's eerie it's strange it's freaky and pairs interestingly well with Peggy shouted rap verses eventually it blossoms into this really moody piece of cloud wrap which again is one of the many crazy sudden transitions and be switches all over this album Peggy manages to pack a lot into many of these songs as far as changes and new directions or detours even into the songs that are on the shorter side on a lot of these tracks you get an intro you get a verse and then really it could go anywhere from there the song germs kicks off with what's essentially just like a bit of a glitch hop vibe with monotone rap verses and then all of a sudden Peggy breaks into these screamed raspy falsetto vocals that they kind of remind me of Prince meanwhile another vocal is layered onto the track where he's making comedic jabs of people with liberal arts degrees like he's he's not taking himself for the world that he exists in too seriously it seems like he's trying to take the piss out of everything which is kind of another thing I like about the record it's not just being abrasive and aggressive for the sake of catharsis it's actually trying to prod and provoke anybody who's listening most likely in an attempt to get them to reflect on what their sensitivities might be I could really go over nearly every instrumental on this record and find incredibly intriguing sounds one-of-a-kind unique sample ideas very freaky percussive concepts I guess just go into this album expecting to hear that sort of thing trusting me that they're there as far as downsides I will say there are at least a handful of songs on this thing that I think could have been longer could have been extended places where I think the ideas that Peggy was delivering were very sharp and could have been fleshed out a bit more like the Lib tard track which I thought was hilarious that song really could have gone on for five minutes and it would have laughed the whole way from start to finish and there are definitely a few cuts as well where I think Peggy while the songs are longer and are a bit more gratifying he does get into the weeds a little bit Williamsburg I would say is a prime example of that so maybe into the future Peggy's long game could use some work but the vast majority of tracks on this thing are pretty short pretty all over the place and I do like the almost random disheveled quality of this project it makes it feel like the nastiest gnarliest craziest mixtape I've ever heard the album's unpredictability is kind of a quality that helps it because as the tracklist moves along Peggy continues to just kind of deliver left hook after left hook and even though the tracks on here may be short not the most satisfying they all kind of weave together into this very messy tapestry and as the album goes along it just kind of gets freakier and more harrowing and more hostile especially when you hit some of the finishing tracks on this thing 1488 and curb stomp overall love this thing one of the most off-the-wall and creative rap projects I've heard in a while feeling a decent too strong eight and gave it an

a review of the new Freddie Gibbs in Madlib car driving by album pinata this is the long-awaited full-length LP from DJ producer rapper Madeline aka Otis Jackson jr. aka Lord coifs aka the loop digger aka the bee conductor and Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs my love for Madlib and hip hop just run so deep he's been the architect of some of my favorite songs and albums in this genre like mad villainy and the unseen he's worked with numerous emcees who might have a lot of respect for like mos def many paths blue Talib Kweli there's so much I can say about this guy and I feel the few artists out there right now define hip-hop quite in the same way that he does he's prolific he's unique a great deal of his output is impressive despite the deceptively simple approach he takes to sampling and beat assembly his instrumentals are jazzy they're smooth they're colorful they tend to be a little dusty a little grimy and occasionally he will put an instrumental out there that is incredibly experimental or off-kilter however I've never really been as crazy about Freddie Gibbs I never thought he was a terrible emcee maybe a little redundant with his flow sometimes and his subject matter he tends to kind of tow this gangster rap line and simultaneously is also self-aware enough to kind of give an objective look at this lifestyle that he leads and not only love it and embrace it but kind of critique it as well however on his most recent projects I think here and there he is dipped into some trashy hooks I've always heard a song or two that I liked but never anything more than that really which kind of kept me on the fence as Freddie Gibbs and mad live announced the fact that they were going to be teaming up coming out with a record and they were putting out some pretty good song and EPS like deeper and shame as well as thuggin because even though these songs were really good who knows if it's actually gonna pan out to a great record it's not like Madlib hasn't dropped lackluster collaborative projects before OJ Simpson but I came out of this record incredibly surprised oh man this thing is good it showcases everything that I love about Mad Libs instrumental style and on top of it Freddie Gibbs seems to be on his best behavior when it comes to the lyrics and these songs the concepts that he has in these songs just generally being focused on the subject matter at hand and consistently he delivers the more thought-provoking side of his typically gangster persona as far as the beats go on this thing there are so many highlights like the very grimy funk groove on the song Scarface the tinny synthesizers on this thing the weird kind of police sirens or what sounds like gunshots going on in the background this thing sounds like it was lifted straight out of a 70s exploitation film and with mad lib while the appeal continues to be the assembly the composition of the beat it's also how he treats the sounds within the beat to this instrumental as if this could even be the case but this instrumental sounds like it was made in the 70s and it sort of has gotten more wrinkles and just sort of flabbier and more experienced over time in a good way I mean it's kind of like a finely aged wine or cheese I love the warm base and the stuttering high hats and the analog synthesizer lead pricks on the Songhai the twinkling guitar leads on the songs thuggin are fantastic this instrumental to me is is really top-notch when it comes to the more psychedelic side of Mad Libs instrumentals and that's another thing I don't think he gets enough credit for while he is you know very very strictly a hip-hop producer I think his beats have always had a very subtly psychedelic quality to them sort of triggers triggers trippy very textured they're Shitsville which is maybe my favorite beat on this entire LP with it's really classical string arpeggios playing throughout the track I love the groove the beat of this song - really one of the more cinematic instrumentals on the entire LP and there are some other instrumentals here as well that the sort of shoot for that glassy high-class soul sampling like robes this instrumental is so beautiful it's like one sample one beautiful sample of a song cascading over another it's so layered it's so beautiful and I think the song shame with bj the chicago kid features a lot of the same characteristics - but BJ's guest vocals on this track are so well mixed into the song and also kind of have a vintage quality to them that I never really took notice of until now just so silky smooth so Golden Age soul that as he's singing over the song is his contribution of the track actually sounds original to the sample there's a really great set of synthesizer arpeggios and some very punchy horn hits on the posse track that ends this song out that features verses from Mac Miller Miche Darko Casey Veggies Domo Genesis gee Wiz and Sunna and the song real the beat that kicks this track off is probably one of the most hard-hitting insane trunk knockers on this entire LP not only does the beat hit hard but I love how noisy the instrumental is and yet Freddie Gibbs just has enough space to kind of do what he does it just sounds like there's so many twinkly guitars or maybe even sitars just piling on top of each other with this track and what I suspect are maybe xylophones or vibra phones kind of littered in the background - and then the track just kind of stops and kicks into this surprise beat transition which is an incredibly blissful piece of hip-hop magic it real highlight on this LP and then there's the song bomb that has a number of different synth sounds watery synthesizer leads a kind of really bright shrill wall of synthesizers that pop in occasionally and yet the song is eerie and spacious enough to give Freddie Gibbs just the perfect stage for what he's trying to you lyrically and that is the number one most important thing about these instrumentals they complement what Freddie is doing and that's important his delivery tends to run a little monotone and and that is part of what has made me so unenthusiastic about his past projects but Madlib does such a great job of setting the emotional tone of each song that it's like almost as if I can kind of predict the sort of track that Freddie Gibbs is going to come through with before he even starts spitting the sound of these beats just fits the tone of these songs so well like for example the track deeper a song where Freddie Gibbs essentially used to be in love with this girl the relationship is over and it cut him deep and every single time he says that on the hook of this track I'm just like damn essentially this woman matured beyond him and his thug life and wanted to date a guy who was just in Freddie Gibbs account more Square and he also makes know that what does this guy got that I ain't got he's just trying to be an astronaut although astronauts are pretty cool but with the twist ending toward the back end of this track this is easily one of the most impressive tracks I've heard Freddie Gibbs pulled together and then there's the song thuggin where essentially Freddie Gibbs is like addicted to this street lifestyle he doesn't see himself leaving it he says he's going to be sagging his pants when he's 40 and even if he does leave the streets are still going to be in him and while he does seem to again embrace this lifestyle he doesn't really paint a very pretty picture of growing old in this world this is a sentiment he expresses again but I think with even more vivid lyrics on the song broken and then for those who are looking down on Freddie Gibbs and the life that he leads there is the track Shitsville where essentially he's kind of putting haters in their place not only with one of the most relentless flows on this entire LP but with the mantra that you're just like me with all the cheating the drinking the drugs he just kind of sees himself as being someone who is making the best of the situation that he's in like anyone else and agree or disagree the passion that he has for this on this track is undeniable and simultaneously this track is a bit of a welcome to my world kind of anthem - with a killer hook that shows off a pretty strong Tupac influence not a comparison I usually make because so many rappers are quick to already compare themselves to Tupac hmm but this is one of the few moments where I think not only the sound of Freddie Gibbs voice the way that he delivers this hook and the level of skill that he shows on this track as well I mean the comparison is legit their tracks for Freddie Gibbs is not quite as conscious and and goes right for the aggressive jugular like on the song bomb where he's kind of putting himself into this coke dealer persona selling drugs getting people addicted of course Raekwon the chef is on the back end of this track delivers a very appropriate verse and the last line on Gibbs first verse of this track is hilariously violent talking about how he's going to be leaving these people's thoughts on his shoelaces and then there's the song reel where immediately right after the intro Gibbs goes in on Young Jeezy really hard for mismanaging him when he was on his CT world label he's pretty unforgiving about the whole thing and he takes some hard shots and then there are some other tracks on here the feel really relaxed laid-back kind of blissful like Harold's where it seems like Freddie Gibbs kind of reminisce is about the past his favorite fast-food fried chicken orders and then there is the song shan with bj the chicago kid again while this track is a bit of a heartbreaker relationship-wise it is a very relaxed laid-back beauty on the first half of this LP Gibbs really holds his own track for track 4 track the only real bump in the road is the Danny Brown feature on the Songhai which doesn't really ruin the track for its lyricism but the song is just so laid back and smooth and then Danny Brown comes through with no disrespect to the delivery or the flow obviously I have already dug it on numerous tracks but for this particular song I think Danny Browns more toned delivery would have done just perfectly but as far as the second half of this LP there are a load of features that seem to pile in all at once and and bring this record to a pretty strong close there's damo Genesis and Earl on robes again and again Damo seems to be just improving with every new feature that I hear him on I respect the hustle then there is Earl's verse on here which I mean you can't really expect a bad guest verse from earl scarface sounds great unbroken then Freddie Gibbs and absol actually come together on the track Lakers and sort of do a tribute to the west coast I can't always expect a great guest verse from AB but he does it on here and the basketball references continue on the track Knicks immediately after which in a way with Lakers here and Knicks being right there afterwards is sort of a nod to New York but this song topic wise is a lot less geographical and more about Freddie Gibbs history his past kind of repeating the violence that he's been living with for so long again Freddie Gibbs comes through with a really focused idea concept message on nearly every track here Madlib comes through with some really great instrumentals every track here there are a few moments that are maybe a little inconspicuous like the intro could have been more hard-hitting I think the song you know does not stick out quite as much as other tracks on here however this is still a hell of a hip-hop album and no question that it's going to go down as one of my favorites of this year I will actually go as far as to say that this record is kind of like the second coming of Mad villain and I can only hope that with time this record becomes just as infamous and that we all kind of sit here with blue balls waiting for these guys to follow this record up this is the best thing I've heard Freddie Gibbs on period and I could only hope into the future with new mixtapes and new albums that he is able to keep up this kind of focus this kind of passion and this kind of captivating storytelling I'm feeling a light a decent 9 on this thing transition if you give in this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Freddie Gibbs mad lib pinata forever "},{"id":"PWsug6Lx-V8","title":"Marilyn Manson - Heaven Upside Down ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"boy oh boy hi everyone oh boy Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Marilyn Manson album heaven upside down Lord of darkness and shock rocker Marilyn Manson he is back with his 10th full-length album here one of my most anticipated rock records of the year not only because I thought the lead-up singles to this album were pretty good but also in this third leg of Manson's career he's kind of been on an upward trajectory beginning with a very rough start on born villain in 2012 I could appreciate Marilyn Manson embracing more of his post-punk influences on this thing and transitioning over from Interscope to a more independent venture but the recording and the production on this thing in my opinion was hideous I mean whatever this album was Chris Rena who also worked on the high end of low could could not save this thing Manson would eventually go on to work with music producer and film composer Tyler Bates who would help him come through with a somewhat heart bounce back on the pale Emperor a few years ago an album that would show Marilyn Manson channeling some of his old-school industrial rock ferocity once again but then also bringing in some classic hard rock into the fold some of these hard rock influences did play out a little awkwardly on this album but there was certainly potential there and rather than going through another reinvention it seems like Marilyn Manson and one of his greatest musical collaborators Twiggy Ramirez as well as Tyler Bates once again are kind of trying to hone the sound that they struck upon with pale emperor which is admirable but but I wouldn't say their efforts really truly pan out initially with the singles and actually my first few listens to the album I was kind of impressed with the raw crunchy industrial rock riffs on this thing but as I listened more I found that there's just so little to this album beyond that I mean the opening track reads like a toothless version of the irresponsible hate anthem and unfortunately Manson just continues to live as a hammer without a nail or a gun without a target as evidenced in just how tepid and general a lot of the lyrics on this record are which a lot of the time don't really venture beyond Manson's usual blasphemous them Maddox which honestly is still a weird position to see him in I mean maybe it would have made sense for him to to be here in this spot he's not quite as controversial as he used to be like five or six years ago but now in 2017 we live in an age of Trump people are more sensitive and outraged than ever the fact that Marilyn Manson is doing so little to guide or channel this cultural fire is kind of disappointing especially given his status as a showman and as a social lightning rod as Manson said on mechanical animals on the song rock is dead the shock it's all in your head which is true but he used to be great at getting in people's heads and that just doesn't seem to be the case anymore especially on this new album and I think there's a lot more to it than his time just being over or people just being desensitized to him most likely it's a result of Manson using his music now as more of a refuge than a weapon which I can't entirely blame him for I can't imagine what it's like to be public enemy number one much less keep that reputation up for one decade after another but still Manson makes numerous lyrical references on this album to his usual targets as if his statements have the same impact they used to and they don't which again is sad because I feel like now we need a Marilyn Manson more than ever an artist that's gonna desperately bite at society's cultural wounds like a rabid wolf but again just not the case given that some of the lyrics on this thing are so inoffensive bordering on unintentionally hilarious suck it up snow wipeouts uh it just sounds like really bad coked up goth rock from the 80s and when it comes to the subject of religion and Christian iconography Manson just has nothing all that revolutionary to say at this point it's like he's not just beating the dead horse but he's constantly just stabbing it with a cattle prod of course there are moments on this record as Manson has often been in some of his second act and third act albums where he gets kind of introspective and reflective on his image on his fame on his status in popular culture blood honey seems to be the most prime example of that with Manson singing about how his audience loves to see him upside down in a way clearly he feels on happy with the idea of being used and then left or sort of being no more than an object for his audience which surely is true to an extent but is somewhat of a mischaracterization at least from the standpoint of me as someone who loved his music in the past because III don't love hearing Marilyn Manson himself upside down I love hearing it when he's turning the world upside down although I guess the world is kind of already upside down right now because there are scarier things than Marilyn Manson still it's an incredibly anguished moment on the album emotionally crippling to an extent even if the mix is kind of messy with the keyboards like sounding way too loud and they just do not slip into the guitars and drums that that nicely there are at least a couple tracks that I could see myself returning to maybe Saturnalia being one of them which is easily the best post-punk throwback on the entire record the nocturnal groove coming out of the drums the nimble bassline the Spacey production and the whole performance feels like a almost like a loose Jam there's a roaring hook on this thing and I'm definitely feeling like vibes coming from the cure or Bauhaus but with like a bit of a an alt metal twist the song also hits one of the highest vocal intensity points for Manson toward the end of the track - and then you have the very brooding kill from a loaded with dirty bass really slick guitar licks a very simple kick clap pattern it's dark it's sexy it's sensual there's a sweet glassy chorus on this track that sort of throws back to the mechanical animals era and the lyrics are filled with these cultish nods to blood pacts and complete control there are moments where I feel like the album is really lacking vocally Manson's tortured moaning and shouting come off somewhat awkward and strained like on the song tattooed and reverse oh god be bridled of course meanwhile all the hard rock riffs that Manson finds himself on top of with this record while they're a little better executed like it sounds really clean it sounds really well produced but musically it's kind of run-of-the-mill and it sort of takes the wind out of the sails of the record especially on the closer and the title track I mean this kind of instrumental backing just as very little to build up Manson's image as does this album as a whole because much of it in my opinion is very deflated it's flaccid it's a couple of great tracks a handful of moments that are admirably personal but it's not like Manson hasn't reflected on his transition from shock rocker to just rocker I could see the hardcore fans being more into this than I am but honestly I was pretty indifferent toward this thing like the tunes on this record a lot of the time are just simply okay some of the lyrics are incredibly disappointing and extremity and controversy are just so integral to Manson's band that to see him not deliver them in spades yet again it just leaves me feeling kind of cold on this record feeling a light too decent

REVIEW","y":9,"x":"yeah mini-review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kumasi Washington Record the epic this is a long album therefore this will be a pretty long review but before we get into the longer part of this review I thought for those of you who might just kind of want to cut to the chase we will do a short mini review before we get to this longer review here we go yes yes yes yes and there you go that's the mini review of this record now if you're looking for something that is a little bit more descriptive in depth uh here we go saxophonist bandleader composer Kumasi Washington you might have heard his name and his playing before because he's actually performed on flying lotuses latest record you're dead and this new album of his is actually on flying lotuses record label brain feeder records but commuter knee has been running long before that point he's been a multi-instrumentalist since his teens over the years he has had the opportunity to collaborate with tour behind some big names and pop soul jazz as well as hip hop there is one CD from about a decade ago that you could check out Kumasi is featured in a group named the young jazz giants he also has a handful of kind of small obscure self-released albums a lot this new record from Kumasi and his band really seems to be his first big step on a label backing his music with some major promotion while he has been working for years on music much of that time has been spent backing up and helping other artists now he is really giving us a long hard look at him and and his creative ideas in the limelight and the vision is actually pretty fantastic and on this first big outing Kumasi has seen fit to give us this album which is a three hour jazz epic consisting of pretty much three albums within an album each of which from what I feel can be enjoyed outside of the context of the record itself so don't feel pressure to listen to this whole thing in one sitting try to take the time to maybe not listen to the whole thing in one go but maybe just get to know each album individually and then from there if you feel like listening to the whole thing and just a a marathon then go for it still though even without the the looming obligation to listen to LP from beginning to end when listening to this album I was still kind of worried is there enough diversity and creativity on this record to justify three hours of length and ultimately to that question I have to say yes between the instrumentation on this LP brings a lot of different flavors the handful of horns that appear on this record the percussion the the piano the bass is the electric and the upright you might actually your thundercat on this record who you might be familiar with from flying lotuses music as well the vocalists as well as an entire string section is employed to create the magic of this album and a bunch of different jazz styles are brought to the table on this album as well whether it be some spiritual jazz or Bop and its subgenres you have a bit of jazz fusion on here fusing jazz with funk and of course there's vocal jazz on this thing and even a beautifully harmonious and melodic rework of de Busey's clair de lune over the course of three hours the epic goes down a lot of emotional and and musical avenues so in this review because we are talking about so much music here I hope to just kind of talk about each album individually not going too deep into every single track just because I mean again it's a lot of music here even before the epic begins Komachi is making I think a lot of presumptions naming this album the epic giving this longing just very deep gaze into the viewer or the the listeners eyes on this album are as well as placing himself into space and on top of all of that we have the opening track here titled changing of the guard you would think that together Komachi and his band are trying to come out with a game-changer here and when you listen to the opening track of this record those ambitions are kind of confirmed for me anyway because every bit of instrumental Arsenal this album has to offer is just locked and loaded on this track the horns the heavy drums the bass as well as the huge group vocals and the the massive string sections on this thing this song is just all cylinders firing at once there is a very cacophonous and and very intense piano solo that sort of pops out against some very cooled drums and bass on this track and this solo kicks off this song's fantastic gauntlet of improvisational performances and I love this song's theme and I think the interplay between just the main jazz instrumentation on this track is fantastic I guess my one reservation about this song though is that it just seems a little bloated or just overwrought at points especially when the strings don't really seem to be matching the flavor of the instrumentation when the horns and the drums as well as the pianos are getting really intense really cacophonous meanwhile the strings are sort of maintaining their very glossy clean very composed outward appearance instrumentally the next track on here asked him actually has a similar size to it in terms of instrumental presence but I think there's just maybe a bit more grace to how the strings are worked in and I actually think the strings complement the Jazz instrumentation when it's sort of building up to its peak of intensity really nicely and the song actually smooths out very beautifully after that and it's by the second track here that I'm actually starting to really love Kumasi 'he's playing style on this record sometimes he is pulling out these really flashy virtuous dizzying and in melodic solos or he is just blowing in his instrument so hard that it's screeching it's screaming and he's just blurting out these these really hard-hitting intervals that even even though they may be simple in a sense they're really emotionally powerful all over this LP Kumasi shows finesse as well as just brutish power on the sax and it's wonderful on the following track Isabel there is kind of this a just very sad teary-eyed soap opera esque organ that fits the very laid-back and slow pace of the performance on this track very nicely it's a milder song the track listing here one that didn't really stick out to me quite as much but I love how musically resolves from some very sour and dissonant melodies and harmonies to some very beautiful and harmonious chords you know sort of going back and forth throughout the performance between those two flavors there is the song final thought which hits way harder really an aggressive standout for the first third of this album one of my favorites in the track listing here and the song the next step which is sort of a I don't know kind of an inconspicuous track for me at the start there's a load of moments on this track where we're kind of getting this this very standard and run-of-the-mill walking jazz bass line fitting against some pretty standard jazz instrumentation but I think this songs sort of trick this this ace and its sleeve that it kind of pulls out as it progresses along is that it turns from this this very plain sounding jazz instrumentation into these really amazing a sense upward the instrumentation kind of becomes noisy scattered really just fills the mix in this beautiful gorgeous way and I feel like I am I'm transported from this this place where I feel very familiar to the sound to the tone to the musical world that I'm in to like being like where Kumasi is right now just listening I feel like I'm rocketed off to this intergalactic musical realm the next step I feel like the title here actually means something and that I am stepping away from this kind of normal jazz sound to something just a little bit more I don't know hard to put into words and the closing track of the first third of this album is a really nice beautiful piece of vocal jazz with some powerful lyrics although I will say the singing on this record consistently is a little campy and that's nothing specific to this record or anything like that there's a lot of very campy vocal jazz out there it's just kind of a style a delivery that you might have to get used to if you're unfamiliar with vocal jazz there are plenty of camping metal singers out there but that doesn't necessarily mean that their music can't be appreciated for what it is is but the camp eNOS is there it's kind of theatrical it's a little over acted but in a sense this track kind of sounds like the the closing to a very great first act of some kind of amazing and vicious jazz stage show now part one gives this LP a great start but for me part two of the epic is really where this album sparked for me really came to life I feel like on part two Kumasi and the next step are a little less focused on big presentations and impressing the listener and introducing themselves and and now they just really dig in and deliver a goddamn great jazz record this part two of the epic is to me a perfect or near-perfect album within a larger album from the very fast and furious misunderstanding that kicks the second part off which is just so intense I love the theme melody of this track and I am just just blazed by the pace that Kumasi and his band are able to keep up on this track which contrasts very nicely with the slower sweeter melody on the song Leroy and Lanisha which comes up directly after feels kind of like something I would hear in a musical then the pace picks up we get a funky bass groove and some tight hand percussion on the song rerun and on top of it the vocals just the extra instrumentation complements the intense performances on this second third of this album specifically on this track really nicely which I think was a must because this second part of the epic has the most fiery performances of the entire album for me seven prayers was a nice move to put on this second disc because it is one of the most soft and kind of fluid songs throughout the entire LP it really feels like the horns are guiding the rest of the instrumentation on this track they're working at a very syrupy fluid tempo while the pianos and the percussion kind of just orbit and encircle around dance around these horns and in a really sort of lazy cluttered way but it's a beautiful clutter the song henriette our hero brings more vocal jazz to the table and I love that with each third here we're getting more lyrics more singing just kind of break up the different flavors of each part of this record and then the closing track here oh the Magnificent Seven has some of the most intense horn solos on this entire record to the point when I was first listening to this track um got kind of choked up especially with the rhythm instrumentation playing so intensely behind these solos really just giving the emotion the emotional power of the horn playing on this record just a really strong foundation just lifting up the horn playing in a really aggressive way and the result is just chemical you know just chemical chain reaction just explosions musical explosions all over this record again you know scan got a little choked up listen to this track because it's just so the saxophone is just screaming on this song and there's some great big chorus vocals on this track too as well as a kind of just weird psychedelic ish bass solo that kind of glides the song out and some really sharp string embellishments that are kind of playing the background bed again another third on this album finishes with an amazing just very eventful closer and and really the epic could have stopped here but it keeps going into our third part where we get the song rerun home which is kind of a revisit to the song rerun which has a bit of a I guess a nuttier percussion section some Dueling horns matches as well I wish the sound of this track the way that they reappropriation that this newer take on the song is six minutes longer than the original which was already eight and that's the thing about this album I mean you're getting long tracks on this thing you know if you're if you're not that familiar if you're not really a big jazz fan listening to the first disc of this album can be a little unwelcoming at first because you're getting one 12-minute song after another so whether you're a jazz fan or not if you are listening to this album and you feel like you know you're just getting a little tuckered out listening to this album sort of pace yourself just take a break because there are a lot of beautiful moments on this record that you don't want to miss so this rerun home track I mean really great 70's style funk percussion and just backing instrumentation on this song the rework of clair de lune on this last third is wonderful another tear jerker moment for me with Cherokee and with Malcolm's theme we're getting these vocal jazz tributes to the two figures that are mentioned in the titles to these tracks we actually get a vocal snippet of Malcolm X talking at the very end of Malcolm's theme and the closing track the message I mean you know maybe not the most explosive track on the entire LP but is one of the harder songs here and for better or worse it closes the album out I would just say at this point it's just another fantastic performance in a gauntlet of already fantastic performances maybe it doesn't seem quite as special when I'm listening to it in the context of the entire record but sort of in the context of this last third of this album I mean it's certainly great because again I do feel like these albums can be listened to out of context of the Greater record you don't need to listen to the entire thing in one sitting so there are a lot of musical highlights all over this LP but sort of the the the grandeur sort of foundational things of this record the production is amazing I mean all the instrumentation is just recorded very well with the exception of a few moments at the very beginning of this album I think these strings and the group vocals blend into the jazz instrumentation very nicely the bass sounds great the drums sound great the horns the vocals I mean it's all just very well placed the time that it must have taken to record as well as mix this 3-hour album is it's it's it's it's scary to think of then we have the interplay between all the musicians on this record just the core jazz instrumentation is great I mean that alone without the extra vocals without the strings would make an amazing record and then we have just the solos which track four track four track are astounding the music and the writing on these songs those tracks that do have you know composed elements to them as well as just the intricacy of these songs as well there's just you know nothing as far as a foundational characteristic of this record that I'm disappointed with and and it's these things as well as just all the the variety and the diversity among these tracks and just the you know the wonderful embellishments in each song and improvisation is I mean it's it's all these things that are going to continue to drive me back to this album over the course of this year because with each listen I'm just going to be picking up and just enjoying more things the one critique one big critique I could make of this record though generally is that I mean it's three hours long and not that it is too long not that you know it should have been shorter but you know with a record that delivers three hours of music of course not every moment is as amazing as the next but um I give this album super duper like high praise for coming out with this much music and just the vast vast vast vast vast majority of it being incredibly enjoyable fun forward-thinking and creative and I don't think there's anything else I can say about this amazing three-hour album I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this record transition give giving a shout magician what did you freak a dick of it did you want to pet it did you want to euthanize it and what

ALBUM REVIEW","y":5,"x":"ah ah hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is gonna do a quick review just lay down some quick thoughts on this new gucci mane album mr. davis the latest project from atlanta rap legend mist mr. Gucci man listen this project it's very long it's an hour long and while it is being marketed as an album it's just kind of like a glorified mixtape at the end of the day it's got some somewhat big features from ty dolla sign and Big Sean and Nicki Minaj is on here too but here's the thing while Gucci Mane has certainly cleaned up his act and he's kind of in the middle of a new chapter of his career where things are looking a little bit brighter and a little bit more successful for him and he has dropped some some serious w's since he's gotten out of prison I mean probably my favorite of all of them has to be drop-top WAP though um everybody looking is pretty good too I mean I wasn't crazy about it but you know I thought that was pretty good but again drop-top WAP that project he has out with Metro boomin doing a so many of the the beats on that thing is is just excellent from start to finish I mean the shame about that project is just that it's not very long however this is very long and even though gucci has a newfound clarity to his delivery and to his music there are a lot of very plain and obnoxious spots on this tape like some of some of the love songs on this thing are pretty much intolerable for me i mean he does have his spots here where he delivers a great flow that's kind of quirky and unique though simplistic or has you know kind of a quirky instrumental or delivers some somewhat personal lyrics like on the song work-in-progress i wish we saw more of that side of gucci mane on this project because honestly a lot of the time he just sort of falls into a lot of the same cliches and a lot of the same very familiar tropes that you will hear on nearly every gucci mane mixtape and again because this is a glorified mixtape there is a lot of filler on here there are a lot of tracks on here that are completely unnecessary and gucci mane while he certainly does have a voice and he has style and he is a talent he's not so versatile a rapper that he holds up for an entire hour like he doesn't have that many tools in the tool belt for an entire hour of music to sound interesting from beginning to end and it's not like the features on this thing as good as some of them are Big Sean's was certainly better than I would have anticipated to be his delivery was kind of low-key but I thought his lyrics were actually kind of smart and and witty but um you know again having said that it's not like the features on this thing are exactly saving the tape or sort of making it worth trudging through the entire thing so at the end of the day I'm kind of indifferent toward it you know while it does have some highlights it's a little too clean it's a little too commercial it's a little too pristine it's a little too long it's a little too OneNote in one-dimensional and while I look forward to Gucci Mane putting out some projects in the future where he goes a little bit harder takes a few more risks like he did on drop-top WAP I have to anticipate that they're gonna be albums or mixtapes like this along the way where he is just going for some big features he's playing as super safe he is not really doing anything too out of the ordinary and he's not really progressing himself in any way shape or form I feeling kind of like a light too decent five on this thing you know it's not terrible but it there's nothing really to write home about either I would say but what did you guys think of this project did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next let me know down in the comments and I will catch you guys in the next one over here next to my head I will link to me talking about the drop-top WAP project or you can hit the link to subscribe to the channel and you're the best all right little minute forever "}]
